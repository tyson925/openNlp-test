   
   
      
         OK.
         <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Um</ENAMEX>.
         This is a story that my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> told me when I was small, a long time ago that, there was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> that, she was very young, she was going to go visit her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>.
         And she was like driving on a curve.
         And she was, she was going very, too fast, and she crashed and then she, um,
         she goes there, um, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every year</TIMEX> she comes out at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> and then <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> passed through that curve and saw her and he stopped there and picked her up and she told him that if she can, if he can take her home to her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> house.
         And he goes, "Yeah, sure, I'll take you."
         And then he took her, and she told him that was her <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> right there, so he left her there.
         And <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two days later</TIMEX>, he came and visit her and then he knocked on the door and asked for her, and his, her, his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mom</ENAMEX>, her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mom</ENAMEX> told her, told him that she, she wasn't here, because she was dead for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a long time</TIMEX> and he goes, "How can it be?"
         But, that he brought her <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two days later</TIMEX> and that's what happened.
         And <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every year</TIMEX> she comes out at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> and asks <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> for rides home because she never get, she never got a chance to go visit her, her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>.
      
      
         Before she died.
         Oh.
      
      
         Before she died and she crashed on that curve.
      
      
         Oh, can you think of any other stories?
      
      
         Not really, that's all.
      
      
         Not really?
         Any stories from your grandpa, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aunt</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">uncle</ENAMEX>?
      
      
         <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Na</ENAMEX>, that's the only one they told me.
      
      
         Is there a favorite story or storybook or anything that you had when you were little that somebody read to you?
      
      
         No, they didn't, no, just that one.
      
      
         OK.
      
      
         Enough?
