         Fortunately, I'm able to, to pinpoint one that happened to me because it happened in the recent history of my life.
         It happened to me in, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>.
         To give you a little bit of brief history, I came out of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 80s</TIMEX> like a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> did, kind of floundering, trying to figure out some new directions.
         I'd been through a lot of violent up and down swings and created peaks and valleys in my financial life and emotional life, and, course I'm sure my, my mental frame, but everything settled down and I was going along, had a good job, was dating a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX>.
         Just enjoying life in general, had a wonderful relationship with my <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> precious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughters</ENAMEX>.
         <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of my hobbies/vices/pleasures was playing <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">tennis</ENAMEX>.
         I played tennis out at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Charlotte Tennis Club</ENAMEX>.
         I've been a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> out there for quite some time, primarily playing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>'s doubles and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>'s singles.
         Played a lot more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>'s singles in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 80s</TIMEX> than I did in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 90s</TIMEX>; as we had gotten older we seemed to migrate more towards <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>'s doubles.
         Had a group of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> that I played tennis with on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">nights</TIMEX>, and, at the time, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">nights</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoons</TIMEX> for quite some time.
         On <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> particular <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> we were playing mixed doubles, played against, played beside, rather, a group of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, all of whom I knew and we'd kind of kidded because this was a group of very attractive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of whom I knew, but the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> one I didn't know.
         Like I say, I was playing with some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> of mine and, and I was literally smitten, almost like a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixteen-year-old</TIMEX>, by this new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>, so much so to where it was very, very difficult for me focus, on my game <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that day</TIMEX> and I was pretty much a, a weak link in the match for that entire period.
         Well, could never catch the eye of this new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">player</ENAMEX>, so the match was over, their match was over, they left, I left, and just kind of went on with my life.
         Well, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few weeks</TIMEX> after that, I ran into one of the other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ladies</ENAMEX> there who, along with her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>, were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> of mine and I asked her who that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> was.
         And she told me who she was; she said her name is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sally Trull</ENAMEX>, she lives in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gastonia</ENAMEX>, she's married, I mean she's, uh, divorced, and has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>.
         And she said, "And she's looking for somebody who plays <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">tennis and</ENAMEX> has a sense of humor."
         And I said, "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Well</ENAMEX>, that would definitely be me," however, at the time, I was dating someone and didn't think too terribly much about it.
         Well, low and behold, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several weeks later</TIMEX> I received a call from this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX>, asked me if I wanted to play mixed doubles on a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>.
         It would be she and her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> against myself and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sally</ENAMEX>.
         So I said, "Certainly."
         We all agreed to meet at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">club</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">six o'clock</TIMEX>.
         Well, I got there, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sally</ENAMEX> was there, she had come straight from work.
         However, our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">club</ENAMEX> closes on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">nights</TIMEX> so she wasn't able to get in, which wasn't that much of a hindrance.
         The real hindrance was the fact that she had left her tennis shoes under her desk at work, so he, she had showed up to play <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">tennis</ENAMEX> with all of her equipment, her racket, and no shoes, which is just a very, very bad combination.
         Well, we had no choice but to get shoes.
         Of course she, at the time, was living in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gastonia</ENAMEX> and really didn't know her way around <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Charlotte</ENAMEX> very much at all.
         So we decided to go to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Omega Sports</ENAMEX>, which is at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Arboretum</ENAMEX>.
         We were at our tennis <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">club</ENAMEX>, which is over near <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Quail Corners Shopping Center</ENAMEX>, it's really not all that terribly convenient.
         So we hopped in my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> and rode to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Omega Sports</ENAMEX> to get some shoes.
         This particular ride was probably the most crucial point in our relationship.
         Both of us are quite gregarious and we talked to each other a good bit.
         And in the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15 to 20 minute</TIMEX> ride to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Omega Sports</ENAMEX>, as well as the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15 to 20 minute</TIMEX> ride back from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Omega Sports</ENAMEX>, we both gave each other a very good thumbnail of our lives and where we were and what was going on and, and the type <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> that we were.
         It was very informative to me I could feel a very, very strong attraction to, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sally</ENAMEX>, but I knew I had this other relationship going on, um, and didn't really want to do anything to jeopardize a potential relationship with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sally</ENAMEX> because of the other relationship.
         So, we went back, played our match, and as has always been the case with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sally</ENAMEX> and I, or most of the time has been the case with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sally</ENAMEX> and I, we won this match.
         After it was over, everyone wanted to go out and eat, but I couldn't because <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jocelyn</ENAMEX> was at home.
         And I said, "I can't, I really thought this was just a tennis match, I've got to go home, my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX>'s there."
         So, I went home, didn't hear anything for a while.
         <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A couple of weeks later</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sally</ENAMEX> called and invited me to go to <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Jazz Fest uptown</ENAMEX>.
         
         She explained a story about a group of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> from work and I think maybe they'd even rented a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">van</ENAMEX>, um, and were making the rounds, I can't remember all the details of it, but she said, "and I thought maybe you'd want to go," and she added this cleverly, "unless you're seeing someone else."
         So I was honest with her, told her I was and that it was in the process of winding down, um, but I really appreciated the invitation.
         So we, once again, parted ways.
         <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Several weeks later</TIMEX>, after the other relationship had run its course and had been completely wound down, um, I invited <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sally</ENAMEX> to go to a, um, I think <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25th anniversary</TIMEX> party with some, some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that I worked with.
         <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Um</ENAMEX>, we ended up getting together that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night before</TIMEX>, to meet some other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> of mine to kind of give her a baptism by fire.
         <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Um</ENAMEX>, and she played tennis at our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">club</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX>, and then we got together and went to the anniversary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX>, and ended up out with some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> of ours after that was over, and, I think, basically spent <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the entire</TIMEX> weekend together, and I just became closer and closer and closer to her.
         I know that I fell in love with her <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that weekend</TIMEX>, um, and ever since then, she has been an absolutely fantastic part of my life, very integral to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> that, uh, I have become.
         And it's just been an amazing period of time to me that I was so fortunate to find so much of a, to use a very corny term, "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soul mate</ENAMEX>" at that particular point in time in my life when I'd really kind of thrown a towel in on that.
         <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Um</ENAMEX>, but that's, that's a little story about how I, uh, I met my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>, uh, how important she is to me, how things just kind of clicked, all because she left a pair of shoes under her desk and sent us off on the relationship where we are.
         Now, um, thank you.
