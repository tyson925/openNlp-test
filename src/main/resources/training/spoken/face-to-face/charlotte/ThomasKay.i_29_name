         Yeah OK.
         Do you want me to tell my story now?
      
      
         Yes please.
      
      
         OK.
         I am a native of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Charlotte</ENAMEX> as was my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> and her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> before her.
         <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mother</ENAMEX> always enjoyed telling me stories of how she spent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">her summer</TIMEX> as, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summers</TIMEX> as a young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>.
         <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mother</ENAMEX> was raised not far from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Charlotte</ENAMEX> which is a very center of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trade</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tryon Street</ENAMEX>.
         She had <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> close by and the trolley stopped not far from her home.
         She and her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> could walk to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>.
         When <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> arrived with the steamy hot weather the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> would pack up and go out to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> to the river the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Catawba River</ENAMEX>.
         This meant packing a tent with cots for sleeping, pots to use over an open fire, dishes because of course there were no paper product at that time, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>, and most important of all a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cane pole</ENAMEX>, pole to go fishing.
         They would set out in an old car up <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Highway</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shuffletown</ENAMEX> then down a long dirt <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> till they came to the creek bed.
         There they would set up <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camp</ENAMEX> near the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">creek</ENAMEX> for washing a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">spring</TIMEX> for drinking the river was not far down the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX>.
         As I was growing up <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mother</ENAMEX> would often show me the very spot that they camped.
         My great <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandmother</ENAMEX>, who was in a big wooden wheelchair, paralyzed with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX>, would go on this camping trip for the whole <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> also.
         <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mother</ENAMEX> and her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> spent their days playing in the woods, wading in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">creek</ENAMEX>, swimming on the scuppernong vines and sometimes picking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">berries</ENAMEX> and going fishing.
         When the rain came my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandfather</ENAMEX> would tell Mother not to touch the tent with her finger because then the tent would leak so of course Mother would lay on her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cot</ENAMEX> looking up at the tent close to her and touch it with her finger a slow drip would come and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mother</ENAMEX> would be in trouble but not as much trouble as when she was playing on the muddy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">creek bank</ENAMEX> and lost her shoe the only pair she had.
         Thank goodness this happened shortly before their return to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> where she could got another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX>.
         All of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mother</ENAMEX>'s life she loved to go barefooted she loved to go fishing for the small perch that she would fry with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grits</ENAMEX> and the rain falling at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>.
      
      
         <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Uh-huh.</ENAMEX>
      
      
         When they were camping at the river my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandfather</ENAMEX> would trap beavers and there were beaver <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dams</ENAMEX>.
      
      
         <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Uh-huh.</ENAMEX>
      
      
         The edge of the lake of the river.
      
      
         <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Uh-huh.</ENAMEX>
      
      
         Like the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Catawba River</ENAMEX> and he would trap beaver and then he would come and he would skin them.
      
      
         <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Uh-huh.</ENAMEX>
      
      
         And he would hang up their hides.
      
      
         <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Uh-huh.</ENAMEX>
      
      
         And let them dry and then he would tan them with some process.
      
      
         <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Uh-huh.</ENAMEX>
      
      
         And bring them back to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Charlotte</ENAMEX> and, sell them but in an, a, especially to the haberdasheries is that a hot, oh a hat <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX>.
      
      
         <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Uh-huh.</ENAMEX>
         New.
      
      
         OK?
         A hat <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">maker</ENAMEX>.
         And uh because at that time the ladies liked to wear beaver hats.
      
      
         Oh yeah I see.
      
      
         And so that was a way of getting added income.
      
      
         Oh so they are beavers in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Catawba River</ENAMEX>?
      
      
         They were at that time.
      
      
         \\Now they are no longer anymore?
         \\
      
      
         \\Her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandfather</ENAMEX> trapped them all.
         \\
         
      
      
         So he trapped the beavers just for the hide to make hats so he could make fashionable hats for the ladies.
      
      
         To sell them to for whoever would purchase them well.
      
      
         Oh, uh-huh.
         Yes, I see.

         Yeah, um--
      
      
         And the tent was a big tent and I suppose it was made out of canvas.
         And they slept on cots.
      
      
         <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Uh-huh.</ENAMEX>
      
      
         Like an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX> cot that type of thing off the ground.
         And <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mum</ENAMEX> said the tent would be very close to her face.
      
      
         Oh, oh yeah.
      
      
         You know and she would lay there and listen to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rain</ENAMEX>.
         She knew that her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> said, "Do not touch."
      
      
         <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Uh-huh.</ENAMEX>
      
      
         Because if you touch it, it made it drip.
      
      
         <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Uh-huh \\</ENAMEX> yes, yes.
         \\
      
      
         \\ It would leak in that spot.

         <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Uh-huh.</ENAMEX>
      
      
         And she would be on her cot and she would touch right up there.
         
      
      
         She's naughty.
         
      
      
         And then it would start and then it would start dripping.
         
      
      
         Oh yes, that's true.
         
         Well.
      
      
         OK that's <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one 15 minutes</TIMEX>, but I don't, that's about it.
      
      
         She was born in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Charlotte</ENAMEX> and raised
         and lived all her life in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Charlotte</ENAMEX>.
         Her, uh, she lived in a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 1920</TIMEX>'s when, uh, her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandfather</ENAMEX> lost his job.
         And the next job that he found was with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Charlotte Water Department</ENAMEX> and uh, had to move to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Water Department</ENAMEX> and that was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about six miles</NUMEX> from the center of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> and it was like the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>.
         It was definitely the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>.
         Most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX> were dirt <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX> and uh, was far away from any public transportation.
         So <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mother</ENAMEX> had to adjust to becoming used to a being a country <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX>.
         And
         one day in the summertime her good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackie</ENAMEX> had come from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>.
         <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackie</ENAMEX> had been a neighbor of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mother</ENAMEX>'s and she had come to from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> out to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> to visit with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mother</ENAMEX>.
         And they were playing and they decided that they would go and pick up <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackie</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> who was at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackie</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>.
         Well they had a little cart; had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> wheels on it.
         And they hooked it up to a pony and they went riding towards <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Charlotte</ENAMEX> in the pony cart.
         They got just to the edge of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, uh, when something spooked the pony and the pony reared up and when he reared up the uh cart turned over.
      
      
         <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Uh-huh.</ENAMEX>
      
      
         And the pony took off running.
      
      
         Oh.
      
      
         Well it ended up with the pony found his way with the cart behind it back to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> out in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>.
      
      
         <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Uh-huh.</ENAMEX>
      
      
         But there was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mother</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackie</ENAMEX> halfway between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> and halfway between the country <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> having to walk all the way, and, of course, they were all scuffed up and their clothes were all dirty
         and they were reprimanded when they uh arrived back home.
      
      
         \\ Oh, so the pony ( )\\.
      
      
         \\ Because they were not supposed to do it.
         \\
      
      
         <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Um</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cart</ENAMEX> got turned over and the pony found his own way back.
      
      
         \\ Yes the pony found, own way back.
         \\
      
      
         \\ While your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Jackie\\</ENAMEX> were just left in the middle of the way and have to walk all the way back.
