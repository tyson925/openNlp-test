         .
         <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Um</ENAMEX>, what can you tell me about the stories that you first remember being told as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>?
      
      
         <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Um</ENAMEX>.
         The stories I remember being told, the most, came out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Little Golden Books</ENAMEX>.
         It was a series of little fiction stories, and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> must have read me every single one of them.
         <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Um</ENAMEX>, do you want names of them?
      
      
         Sure.
      
      
         Well, there were names like <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Pokey Little Puppy, um, Mr. Bear Squash You All Flat, um</ENAMEX>, just, they were just little stories about <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> and they had <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Golden Books</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Little Golden Books</ENAMEX> and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>, I know she bought me every one of them and read them to me.
      
      
         Did your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> read to you too?
      
      
         Sometimes, but I remember my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> reading to me the most.
         I had aunts and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandmother</ENAMEX>, one of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandmothers</ENAMEX> read to me too.
      
      
         <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Um</ENAMEX>, how old do you remember being--
      
      
         <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Um</ENAMEX>, well I know it was before I was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>, probably, I know <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least four</NUMEX> and I'm sure she read to me before that.
      
      
         OK.
         <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Um</ENAMEX>, what do you remember any stories they told you, your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> told you?
      
      
         You mean like imaginary, or fictional stories?
         They made up stories sometimes, my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> in particular, she made up stories.
         In fact I think she still does now
         .
         But she made up a lot of stories then, um, sometimes they had us, my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> and me, in the stories, and then sometimes, the just were from I don't know where.
         But she was very imaginative and creative and she made up lots of little stories for us.
      
      
         Did they ever tell you factual stories about the area that you lived in?
      
      
         Oh yes, yes they did.
         They told me lots of family stories about <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that I knew, about my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandparents</ENAMEX> and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">great-grandparents</ENAMEX>, and um, lots of family stories, history, history of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> we knew or heard about.
      
      
         Um-hum.
         So that helped you learn about <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that you had not necessarily met.
      
      
         No, hadn't seen some of them.
         <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Um</ENAMEX>, beyond my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandparents</ENAMEX> I hadn't seen any of them, I guess, but they began to take on a personality and something I could kind of see in my imagination.
      
      
         Um-hum.
         <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Um</ENAMEX>, what kind of things did you remember reading when you started to read?
      
      
         <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Um</ENAMEX>, I read some of the same books that they had read to me, <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, and then, as I got older, I just got hungry for books.
         I read, my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> had a lot of books.
         They had bookshelves, um, that my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daddy</ENAMEX> built, that were built in bookshelves and he um, they were filled up with books, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one summer</TIMEX>, I remember when I was a teenager, I just made it a mission to read as many of those books as I could, and I plowed, they were fiction most of them.
         There were some were history books in there, too.
         But I plowed through a bunch of them that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX>.
         I just kept reading until I finally had read almost every one of them.
         Lots of them.
      
      
         Do you remember the names of any of them?
      
      
         They were, um, they were best-seller type fiction from the um, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX>'s and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX>'s and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60</TIMEX>'s and on, just, they were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of a book <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">club</ENAMEX> and they got a lot of books that way.
         And whatever they got, I read.
      
      
         <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Um</ENAMEX>, well, let's see, so do you think that those experiences helped you figure out the kinds of things you liked to read?
         Like what, the stories that they told you and read to you, did--
      
      
         Well, they must have because I still read fiction.
         I still read history.
         I love historical novels.
         I love to read just plain history, um, it must have rubbed off in some aspect because that's the kind of thing I still read.
      
      
         <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Um</ENAMEX>, well, do you think it also helped when you became a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> that you naturally wanted to read to your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>?
      
      
         Yeah, I'd always been a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX>.
         I'd always been read to, so I think, yes, I mean I did read to my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>, to you <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX>, to you and your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brothers</ENAMEX>.
         What was that?
         
         Oh, that.
         I had to let the dog in.
         Excuse me.
         All right, now what?
         Oh I know what I was going to tell you.
         <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Um</ENAMEX>, another thing my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> read to us was poetry and she also had books that had songs in it, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>'s songs and so not only did she teach us the words to all those things, but we sang them too.
         And, um, she read, I forgot about the nursery rhymes.
         We learned all of those and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fairy</ENAMEX> tales, the classics, she read all of those to us.
         But the poetry I remember and she taught us, you know, some poetry.
         She remembered poems that she had learned when she was in high school.
         I think she must have enjoyed it because she read them to us too.
      
      
         Original poetry that she--
      
      
         Not really original, no, it was, uh, poems by well-known <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> that you'd find in a book, but she had to memorize a lot of them, and she, but she read us <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>'s poems, too, out of books, books that were written for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>.
      
      
         I see.
         Well, as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX>, do you see reading as something that is still important in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> today?
      
      
         I think a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> are still reading to their young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>.
         I, I do think they read to them when they are little.
         But as they get older, I think <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> are so involved in other things.
         They're going to lessons for this and that, and sports, and they're playing interactive games with their computer and, uh, watching TV, and I think, really, they're not reading on their own, like maybe we did when I was that age because we didn't have all those other things to do.
         So I think maybe, reading for young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, is not as important.
         They're still a few that you get in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">classroom</ENAMEX> who are avid <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> and they just stand out.
         The others, you can see in things like vocabulary and um, just their general knowledge of things, um, they're not reading anymore.
         They don't even watch the news, but they're not reading the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX> or new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazines</ENAMEX> or anything.
         You see it, I think you see it in their, in how they do in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>.
      
      
         Does it affect their comprehension?
      
      
         I think it probably does, because they're just not reading as much.
         <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Um</ENAMEX>, the good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>, the ones who do well academically, they're going to do OK anyway, but the ones, um, there are some that would really benefit from continuing their reading, either being read to or reading on their own, for pleasure--
      
      
         Right.
      
      
         I don't think they do that so much anymore.
      
      
         OK, well
         , um, going back to you, do you think, uh, are there any other ways you can see that reading and listening to stories, and literacy, um, being exposed to literacy, has um, affected you in your life?
      
      
         Hmm, well
         , I had some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> that were really, um, influential about what I read and their love for literature.
         I don't know rather, how much it directly affected the fact that I was an <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> major in college, but I know that, um, it didn't hurt to like to read when you have that major, um, there were some times, I remember, a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX> grade <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> and a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">seventh</NUMEX> grade <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> who were especially, um, full of the love for reading and literature and they made that come alive for me as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX>.
         So, I hope somehow along the way that I've been able to pass that along to my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kiddies</ENAMEX>.
      
      
         Well, I'm sure you probably have.
         Well, um, is there anything else you'd like to add?
      
      
         I can't think of anything, but it's been nice chatting with you.
      
      
         Thank you.
