   
   
      
         OK tell me about whenever you broke your jaw.
      
      
         I'm about to have to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rig</ENAMEX> it.
         
         I was in high school, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX> I was helping my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> outside put a window in, replacing a window, on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garage</ENAMEX> door.
         I had previously broke the window by throwing a baseball through it on, by accident.
         Well, we was replacing this window, and we got it fixed, and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> was like, "Let's go for a little bike ride."
         It was probably <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 5:30 in the evening</TIMEX>, you know, right before <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mom</ENAMEX> had supper ready, so we went for a quick bike ride.
         We got on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bikes</ENAMEX> and went down the road a little piece, and finally my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> said, "OK, I'll race you back, back to the uh, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>, you wuss."
         I said, "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">All right</ENAMEX>!"
         So uh
         , I passed my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX>, I passed him, and about that time my brakes, I don't know what happened, my front brakes got, went in the spokes somehow and it, it made me uh, it flipped me in the air <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about one and a half</NUMEX> times, and I got, we had toe clips on our <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bikes</ENAMEX> and finally, finally my feet came out of my toe clips and my chin hit the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pavement</ENAMEX> and--
      
      
         Were you near your <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>?
      
      
         Yeah kind of.
      
      
         Sort of.
      
      
         We was close by.
         It was probably, it was over, we was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">half mile</NUMEX> from my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>.
         But uh, my chin hit the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pavement</ENAMEX>, and as soon as it hit I felt, I felt something crack right here, and I just laid there on the road kind of shocked and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> was like, "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kevin</ENAMEX>!
         <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kevin</ENAMEX>!"
         you know, came up to me and was like uh, "Oh crap," you know
         .
         And he said a few words, and he didn't want to move me because he, he saw the way I fell and thought maybe I'd broke some ribs or something and he didn't want to move me.
         So I am laying here in the middle of the road, and he kept asking if I am all right and I was like, "Yeah I'm all right," because I knew something was wrong with me, and I hate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> and, and I don't want to go to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> if something happens to me.
         But uh, I was like, "I'm all right."
         Well he picked me up, and put me on the side of the road, and he raced back to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>.
      
      
         
         He left you on the side of the road?
      
      
         He had to.
      
      
         I know.
      
      
         So he raced back to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> to get my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mom</ENAMEX> and get the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>.
         Well, they came and got me and took me back to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>, and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mom</ENAMEX>, I, I was shaking and stuff, my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mom</ENAMEX> was afraid I was going in shock, so she put a blanket around me, and she was like, "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kevin</ENAMEX> are you OK<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">?</ENAMEX>"
         and I was like, "Yeah I'm OK <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mom</ENAMEX>.
         I don't need to go to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> or anything like that, I am fine."
         And she goes, "OK open your mouth for me."
         So I opened my mouth, and I couldn't get it, I couldn't shut it back.
      
      
         You had to go to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> like that
         ?
      
      
         Yeah.
         She was like, she was like, "OK you got to go to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>."
         So I started going nuts
         .
         Well, I get to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>, and they had to put me in this wheelchair, and they rolled me in because I couldn't walk.
         I was just so weak from I don't know, I guess what was just happening.
      
      
         From the flipping?
      
      
         Yeah, and, um, I rolled in there and they was like, "Oh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> was you in a bad car accident<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">?</ENAMEX>"
         
         And because I looked horrible, I mean my chin was bleeding because I busted my chin, and I just looked bad and they, my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> was like, "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nah</ENAMEX> he was in a bicycle accident."
      
      
         
         Just flipped his <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bike</ENAMEX>.
      
      
         So they took me to the hospital <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>, and I'm going nuts <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are having to hold me down while they pull as, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">asphalt</ENAMEX> out of my chin--
      
      
         Oh gross.
      
      
         Because my chin hurt so bad, sewed me up.
         And
         I don't know I never knew what was coming I, I, I never knew what they did when you broke a jaw.
      
      
         Did they put you to sleep?
      
      
         Nah, well like that night they told me they'd let me go home and stuff from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>, and my, I mean my, before I went to bed my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> was like, "Well you got to go see a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialist</ENAMEX> tomorrow," and I was like "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wh</ENAMEX>, what's he going to do?"
         and he was like, "Well he'll just tell you you're going to have to, you know, eat mashed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">potatoes</ENAMEX> and stuff the whole time, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">soup</ENAMEX> and that's it," and I was like, "OK."
         Well, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">that night</TIMEX> I couldn't sleep at all because it felt like a brick wall, a brick, I mean a brick wall was on my head, so much pressure was on my chin and stuff, my jaw.
         So <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the next morning</TIMEX> we go and it was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Doctor Trevez</ENAMEX> I believe.
      
      
         That's who did my um,
         wisdom teeth.
      
      
         Yeah.
      
      
         I liked him.
      
      
         Yeah I did too, actually.
         Well <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Doctor Trevez</ENAMEX> was like, "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Well</ENAMEX>, we are going to have to wire your mouth shut," and I had never heard of this.
         This freaked me out
         I'm a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">freshman</ENAMEX> in high school, I'm like, "What?
         !" and I, I couldn't talk with it, I was like, "Oh crap."
         So they had to put me to sleep, they had to put a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">I.V.</ENAMEX> in my, my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> and stuff.
         And
         what scared me the most was when he said before he put the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">I.V.</ENAMEX> in my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX>, before he did, say before he did surgery, before he was going to do the surgery, he said, "OK uh, let's have a word of prayer."
      
      
         Yeah I was like OK, please.
      
      
         I was like, "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wooh</ENAMEX>."
      
      
         You thought you were going under.
      
      
         So I, so I did, I never heard him finish the prayer though.
         I was, I was out--
      
      
         <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Um-huh.</ENAMEX>
      
      
         Before he got done.
         And I woke up and my mouth was wired shut.
         I ra, I ran around talking like this all the time.
         It was like--
      
      
         <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carla</ENAMEX> probably tortured you.
      
      
         It was like wired shut for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two months</TIMEX>.
         That was probably the most awkward <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two months</TIMEX> of my whole life because I, because I had to drink all this stuff at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>.
         I had to take Ensure and milkshakes with me to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>.
         I couldn't eat regular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>, I had to slurp it up with a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">straw</ENAMEX>, and I, I had uh, was having to drink all these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liquids</ENAMEX> and stuff <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least every thirty</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> to an hour so I wouldn't lose weight.
         They were afraid of me losing too much weight.
      
      
         <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Uh-huh.</ENAMEX>
      
      
         So uh, I had to go through that in high school.
         And you know, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> started doing the "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kevin Talk</ENAMEX>."
      
      
         What, what was that?
      
      
         It was like this, you know, everybody started when they would walk by me in the hall they would , "What's up <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kevin</ENAMEX>?"
      
      
         
         Oh my God!
      
      
         And it was called the "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kevin Talk</ENAMEX>."
      
      
         That's you Burns <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX>.
         That's what y'all do out there.
      
      
         And ever since then, every time I eat now my uh, my left cheek starts to sweat.
      
      
         It sweats
         ?
      
      
         It's got a little circle where it sweats when I eat because I, it did nerve damage--
      
      
         Oh.
      
      
         To my jaw and stuff, there was nerve damage so I sweat every time I eat there, just a little circle of sweat.
      
      
         So you sweat <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about six or seven</NUMEX> times a day
         ?
      
      
         Yeah.
