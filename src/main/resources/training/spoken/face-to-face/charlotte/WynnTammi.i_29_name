   
   
      
         Test, test I grew up in a very small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Dacusville</ENAMEX> and that's in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SC</ENAMEX> and here's the history behind <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dacusville</ENAMEX>.
         It's a very small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> that didn't or doesn't have a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">post office</ENAMEX>, doesn't have a grocery <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX>, really only has a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> gas <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stations</ENAMEX>.
         But we actually lived in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Easley</ENAMEX> and went to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pickens High School</ENAMEX>, but had also a different phone number.
         But anyway, there's some background of the type of small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> that I grew up in.
         <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Um</ENAMEX>, my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> was a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> that sat on <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">15 acres</NUMEX> of land, and I had, um, my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mom</ENAMEX> and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> and a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three year old</TIMEX>, older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX>.
         Well at some point my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> decided that, uh, we needed to have goats, so we fenced in our front part of our yard, which was probably <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about six acres</NUMEX>, and we got <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">goats</ENAMEX>, and on, we also had other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>.
         Like we had a pony and we even actually had a ram at some point but that's another story.
         So we had these <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">goats</ENAMEX> and they were in a fence, an electric fence, and we would have to cut the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">hay</ENAMEX> and bail the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">hay</ENAMEX>.
         Well I know I could not have been any older like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six or seven years old</TIMEX> when we had this pick-up truck that was a straight drive, and, or that's what we called in straight drive and that was a manual shift <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">truck</ENAMEX>.
         And, um, I was really small and that's why I must have only been like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six or seven</TIMEX> because I couldn't do anything else.
         <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Um</ENAMEX>, I couldn't, um, help like bail the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">hay</ENAMEX>, pick up the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">hay</ENAMEX>, do anything because I was so small, so my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mom</ENAMEX> and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> and my older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> could, um, help collect the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">hay</ENAMEX> so my job became driving the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">truck</ENAMEX> and I could reach the pedals.
         I was tall enough to reach the pedals but my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> taught me how and I would get in that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">truck</ENAMEX> and drive around from point to point while they picked up the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">hay</ENAMEX> and put it in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">truck</ENAMEX> and I'd drive the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">truck</ENAMEX> around and wherever it needed to go and they'd store the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">hay</ENAMEX>.
         So yeah, I learned how to drive at a very early age and needless to say my <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> was a straight drive and no one, um, in that town really waited until they were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 or 16</NUMEX> to drive.
         We all were driving pretty early because who's going to know about that far out that we didn't have a license so here's related, um, to driving.
         Another thing, uh, that I learned to, how to do very early on was drive a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">tractor</ENAMEX>.
         Of course because we had to have a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">tractor</ENAMEX> to cut the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">hay</ENAMEX> and do all the things that, you know, involved, I guess, in a semi quasi farm we were pretending to have.
         So my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> taught me how to drive this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">tractor</ENAMEX> and I thought I was big stuff because you sat up high on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">tractor</ENAMEX> and you could see everything, and, you know, I could just drive it, and drive it, and drive it.
         Well, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one Sunday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> it was early, no it was after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>, um, before dinner was ready.
         I was out there and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> said I could drive the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">tractor</ENAMEX> while we were waiting on dinner.
         So I was driving the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">tractor</ENAMEX> around, around, and around, and then I got called in for dinner, so I parked the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">tractor</ENAMEX>.
         Oh, our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX> also sat on a hill and, I think it sat on the top of a hill, and then the field and the fencing went down, and then across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> was my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">uncle</ENAMEX>'s land and no one lived there.
         Over there it was another <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">field</ENAMEX> that was fenced in and I don't think there were any <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> over there, but it was a fenced in filed as well.
         So I parked this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">tractor</ENAMEX> at the top of our driveway, and I go in to eat dinner.
         So we eat and, I don't know, it probably takes <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about an hour</TIMEX>, and I go back out.
         I want to ride the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">tractor</ENAMEX>.
         We go back outside for some reason and it wasn't there.
         And I don't have a clue as to what happened to it and I yell for my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> and we go out there and we start looking and we see trail marks all the way down the driveway through our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">field</ENAMEX> and then there is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">tractor</ENAMEX> on the other side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> in the fence.
         So guess what happened, I being the smart little, what, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six year old</TIMEX> that I was, decided that I forgot or didn't remember correctly that I had put the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">tractor</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> and or in gear and not in neutral.
         I thought for sure, for sure I remembered that my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> said to put it in neutral.
         Yeah, well I remembered wrong so, uh, went over and got the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">tractor</ENAMEX> out and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> drove it back, and I don't know what he did to the fence I'm sure that he fixed it I don't remember how badly it was damaged, but I was so upset I really thought I was big stuff.
         I mean I knew how to drive this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">tractor</ENAMEX> and I couldn't believe that I remembered wrong and I made that mistake and I <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> was scared because I thought I was in trouble but then when I realized I wasn't in trouble I was really, you know, I had lost a lot of confidence because I really thought I was big stuff.
         So I was like, "No more <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">tractor</ENAMEX>.
         I don't want to have anything more to do with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">tractor</ENAMEX>."
         Well my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> said, "Get back on it your going driving."
         So he made me get back on it because he wanted to teach me that we make mistakes and that you just have to get back on kind a like if you fall off a horse so that's my stories that I remember about driving.
         OK going back to the whole goat thing, I'll tell you another story about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">goats</ENAMEX>.
         Uh the fence, um, we had this goat that we bottle fed, actually we bought, our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> bought the goat.
         Most of our <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">goats</ENAMEX> were just regular farm <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">goats</ENAMEX>, but this particular goat was registered.
         He was, you know, high <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> for a goat.
         He had papers and everything and we named him Remington.
         We named all are <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> after TV <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX>.
         Like all are <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> all the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">goats</ENAMEX> were named after TV <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX>, so <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Remington</ENAMEX> was after, uh, I guess that show Remington I forget now but some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX>.
         Well he was our pet <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">goat</ENAMEX> and we raised him.
         As a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX>, we bottle fed him and we had to burn off his horns because if they grow up with horns then they can be dangerous, so you burn them off when they're little.
         We did that and we played with him basically like he was a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> because he was our little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX>.
         He grew up, um, to be a very, um, close animal to us, but because we played with him so much he really thought that he was part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> and he belonged really wherever we were.
         We'd let him in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and, you know, take him in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>, take him in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">truck</ENAMEX>, or just do whatever.
         So <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX> we were, uh, where, we were somewhere in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>, and, like I said, we had this electric fence and the electric fence works only so long until the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">goats</ENAMEX> figure out how to get out a of it or decide that they want out, so they'll, you know, endure <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the few seconds</TIMEX> of shock.
         So yeah, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Remington</ENAMEX> got out he didn't think he belonged in the fence anyway with the other goats so he'd gotten out and, uh, we look outside our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and we had a carport and, um, the storm door was open and the screen, and we look out and yeah he's on to a, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>, him standing on top of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>.
         That was when, I think, we decided we needed to set some more boundaries.
         So <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Remington</ENAMEX>, um, quickly had to learn some lessons.
         OK I'll tell ya another story about my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> because my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> grew up in basically the same area we did, um real <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, and he was the youngest of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>.
         Yeah, um, I'm sure he was an accident, um, and you can tell by his name.
         He kind of got the last of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pick</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Homer Stobo</ENAMEX>.
         Yeah, well, um, well, was like I said, the youngest, so his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> by the time they had him were quite older and I don't think they paid him too much attention or maybe as his older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">siblings</ENAMEX> had to, um, have most of the part in his raising or upbringing that I think he was kind a left to do his own thing for quite a while.
         So he was quite rambunctious, so he used to always tell us stories about things he did as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX>.
         <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> of all, even though he was capable of, uh, going to school and doing his schoolwork, he chose not to and he would always, um, what you call play hooky, and on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">those days</TIMEX> when we wouldn't go to school he would always come up with some kind of tricks, and one of the things I remember him saying that he did and actually since the time this time I had other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> confirm that, uh, this is true that he would take a pocketbook, one of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mom</ENAMEX>'s pocketbooks, and empty it out and tie it a string to the handle and he'd put it in the middle of the road and he and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buddy</ENAMEX> would let the string be long enough to where they could hide in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">bushes</ENAMEX> and still have the string attached and then they'd wait for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> to drive by and there would always be a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> to come by because, of course, this was in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>.
         And a car comes by and sees see a pocketbook they think, you know, we're going to pick this up and do one of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> things.
         Their going to either take it, which what's more likely is that they're going to look because everybody knows everybody so they pick it up, or they get out of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> and they go to pick it up.
         Of course, as soon as they pick it up my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> just would jerk that pocketbook.
         Well you would think they'll just jerk it away and laugh.
         Well they decided that that wasn't fun enough so they would jerk it a little bit and make it seem like it was the wind, or just do it a little bit where they weren't, maybe the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> wasn't quite sure if it really moved or not, or that maybe they accidentally kicked it and they'd do that a couple a times and then they would have basically be teasing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> along until the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> just had thought they were going crazy.
         And then, uh, they finally realized what was going on and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> would run and they would just run and run and run.
         And he would do all kinds of little tricks when he was out a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> but, um, as it turns out he, um, he was quite into trouble his grades didn't quite make it.
         He made a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PE</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> in, um, gym.
         Yeah he, he wasn't quite fond of school and he dropped out in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX> of his senior year, so although he later in life became successful and owned his own <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>, he just didn't, and I guess, and neither did his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> think <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> was that important so his, his stories they always told us didn't involve growing up and going to school and doing well and behaving they were always mischievous.
