   
   
      
         Ready?
         OK.
         This is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dorian</ENAMEX>.
         And your last name is--?
      
      
         <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Myles</ENAMEX>.
      
      
         <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Myles</ENAMEX>.
         OK.
         And she's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17 years old</TIMEX>.
         Where were you born?
      
      
         I was born in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indianapolis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indiana</ENAMEX>.
      
      
         <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Uh-huh.</ENAMEX>
         When did you move to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NC</ENAMEX>?
      
      
         When I was
         <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>.
      
      
         Do you remember how old you were when you learned to read?
      
      
         When I learned to read?
      
      
         <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Uh-huh.</ENAMEX>
      
      
         I was probably <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>.
      
      
         Was it before you started to school?
      
      
         Yes.
      
      
         <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Uh-huh.</ENAMEX>
         So I imagine you enjoyed reading if you were already and you were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> and not in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>.
         Do you remember the kind of books you liked looking at and reading when you were
         little?
      
      
         <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Seuss</ENAMEX>!
         <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Seuss</ENAMEX>.
      
      
         <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Seuss</ENAMEX>?
         Did you like them to be read to you or did you like--.
      
      
         At first.
      
      
         <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Uh-huh.</ENAMEX>
      
      
         And, um, she read them so much that, until I memorized them.
      
      
         So you would play reading?
      
      
         Yeah.
      
      
         Did you go to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX>?
         Did they take you to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX>?
      
      
         Yeah.
         Maybe.
         Not that I really remember.
      
      
         Did you have a favorite <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Seuss</ENAMEX>?
      
      
         The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cat in the Hat</ENAMEX>.
      
      
         I bet you could say it!
      
      
         I can't remember it now.
         
      
      
         OK.
         The kinds of books that you liked to read yourself, were they different from the ones that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> would read to you?
      
      
         Not really, because I pretty much chose the book, and they would read it.
      
      
         And they would read it?
         OK.
         Do you have little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brothers</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sisters</ENAMEX>?
      
      
         No, no.
      
      
         <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nephews</ENAMEX> or nieces?
      
      
         No.
      
      
         Little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> around you at all?
         No?
      
      
         Occasionally.
      
      
         Did you ever read to them?
      
      
         I did.
         I have.
      
      
         <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Uh-huh.</ENAMEX>
         Do you remember anybody in your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> that would tell stories without using a book?
         A grandparent or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aunt</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">uncle</ENAMEX>?
      
      
         Not--.
         No.
         Not that I can remember.
      
      
         So you couldn't remember the story, if you don't have a story to tell.
         Well, that's pretty much what I needed to ask you about.
         I appreciate your helping us out with this.
