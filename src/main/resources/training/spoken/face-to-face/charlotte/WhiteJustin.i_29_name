         What was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tony</ENAMEX> doing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>?
      
      
         Teasing me.
         Taking stuff from me.
      
      
         Is that all?
      
      
         Yeah.
         And mad at me.
      
      
         Is that a good thing to do?
      
      
         What?
      
      
         Is that a good thing to do?

         What does <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marshall</ENAMEX> do that makes you mad?
      
      
         Everything.
      
      
         So you don't care too much for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marshall</ENAMEX>?
      
      
         Yeah, I care about him a lot.
      
      
         Do you love him?
      
      
         <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Uh-huh.</ENAMEX>
      
      
         You just don't get along with him, right?
      
      
         
         Right.
      
      
         Who do you trust and tell all the secret stuff?
      
      
         You, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daddy</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tony</ENAMEX>.
      
      
         You trust him, but you don't like him, right?
      
      
         Right.
