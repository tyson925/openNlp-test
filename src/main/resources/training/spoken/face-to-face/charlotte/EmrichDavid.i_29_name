   
   
      
         OK.
         This is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Emrich</ENAMEX> and he also grew up in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philadelphia</ENAMEX> and he's lived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Charlotte</ENAMEX> for, is it almost <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three years</TIMEX>.
         Is that right?
      
      
         <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Three years</TIMEX>.
      
      
         <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Um</ENAMEX>, and, I'll ask you the same questions as well.
         When you were growing up, do you remember reading a book that uh, you particularly liked and you remember or do you remember someone reading you a book that you particularly liked?
      
      
         See.
         When I was growing up the books I remember the most of were like <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Hardy Boys Mysteries</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Swift</ENAMEX> and those kind of, really, um, you know, just serial, serializations of books and those were the books that I remember <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>.
         I don't remember any specific mysteries or anything like that I just remember reading
         <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozens</NUMEX> of them really, until I was probably <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eight years old</TIMEX>.
      
      
         Is there any particular reasons why you chose those books to read over others?
      
      
         I think that I was given them as a gift.
         The other, because I would, and they kept giving me gifts of books because they knew, knew I liked to read.
         And they were, it would, it would generally be series and like for example I remember, now I, now I recall uh, I'd gotten a series, uh, they'd come in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">box sets</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> and they'd be paperbox, paperbacks in a box with a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> books in them.
         And I remember reading, like, uh I remember reading <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sherlock Holmes</ENAMEX> mysteries this way and I remember reading books by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">J.RR</ENAMEX>.
         Tolkien uh, you know <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lord</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rings</ENAMEX>,
         and you know all those books the same way.
         So I guess that these were the, I mean my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> knew I liked to read and I would always for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> or my birthdays or, or um you know anytime
         a gift was appropriate.
         These were the kind of gifts that I would get.
         I would get other gifts, of course, but not only also get something like this <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every year</TIMEX>.
      
      
         
         Were, I mean, obviously, your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> thought reading was important because they'd give you books because they knew you liked to read.
         Did they, like, when you were younger maybe you couldn't read, did they ever read anything to you that you remember?
      
      
         Hum.
         
         No, I don't recall anything like that, it doesn't mean it didn't happen.
         It just means I don't recall it.
      
      
         Hum.
         Um
         did, as you got older, did they types of book change?
         Did you still like mystery type books?
      
      
         As I got older?
         
         Let's see--
      
      
         You know, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eleven</NUMEX> or twelve--
      
      
         By the time I got to be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eleven</NUMEX> or twelve, I mean, I remember I would read the books that were assigned in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> and I really like those, like, you know, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">seventh</NUMEX> grade <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX>, usually that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Knowles</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A Separate Peace</ENAMEX> I remember reading that and it was very good and I remember reading um, um, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lord</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Flies</ENAMEX> by Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Golding</ENAMEX> which was, was the type of book that was assigned then.
         <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Um</ENAMEX>, even then I used to like to read histories.
         I remember reading very specifically, uh, uh, history of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> rocketry program during <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WWII</ENAMEX> that reading, you know--
      
      
         
            
         
      
      
         I was just
         a thirteen or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fourteen year old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX>.
         <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Uh</ENAMEX>, I remember, actually, I remember reading a book, it was on the best seller list at the time, it was uh, it was probably written in the late seventies and it was called The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War</ENAMEX> and it was, it was uh, it was written as if it were factual but it was uh um, sort of a fictionalized account of what of a, of a potential <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">world war</ENAMEX> and I remember the funny thing, I remember was I read this book like after it was probably `<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">77</NUMEX> or `<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">78</TIMEX> and the war took place, according to this book in like `<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">85 or '86</NUMEX>.
         I wouldn't say I lived in dread, but I always a little afraid of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that year</TIMEX>--
      
      
         
            
         
      
      
         That this was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> that these, these events would come true and that there would be a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War</ENAMEX>.
         In fact, I remember, it was <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">seventh</NUMEX> grade
         .
         I remember because in this particular book, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Soviet Union</ENAMEX>, at that point, had used, um, nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX> against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Birmingham</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>, um, and I had, uh, and that's what caused their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">coalition</ENAMEX> to unravel because none of the coalition <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> wanted any part of that and that was what eventually caused them to lose the war.
         But I remember doing a creative writing piece for a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">seventh</NUMEX> grade reading class um, where I invented a series of newspaper articles surrounding that particular event.
         The fact that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> had launched nuclear attacks various parts, various uh, you know, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> around the world.
      
      
         So you used what you had read to actually, you, you wrote about things you'd actually read?
      
      
         Yeah, I'd--
      
      
         Created your own writing system?
      
      
         Actually, what I did was I imagined that this was, that I was a news <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> writing for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> or whatever--
      
      
         Hum.
      
      
         And I you know, made up a big headline, you know, "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Such And Such a City Destroyed</ENAMEX>," you know, give a by-line, you know, give a date and time and then just start writing what I, what I thought were journalistic articles at that point about that event, event which I had read about in a book, which I had imagined.
      
      
         Hum.
      
      
         Um-hum.
      
      
         <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Um</ENAMEX>, did, do you remember any particular stories that were told to you when you were a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>?
      
      
         Well, ah, I don't remember my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> reading anything I do remember being in grade school and being in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">librarian</ENAMEX> reading <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giant Peach</ENAMEX> to us.
         And we would go to, I forget how often we'd go to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX>, like, you know, maybe it was once a week, maybe it was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a week</TIMEX> but everytime we'd go we'd all sit on the rug we'd sit <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX>- style, cross-legged and, uh, I'm sure it's very politically incorrect at this point, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">librarian</ENAMEX> could never say that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>.
         <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Um</ENAMEX>, and then she would read us, you know, chapter at a time of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giant Peach</ENAMEX>.
      
      
         Did you look forward to reading or hearing her read <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giant Peach</ENAMEX>?
      
      
         Yeah, sure did, I think, think I enjoyed James and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giant Peach</ENAMEX>.
      
      
         Hum.
      
      
         In fact, I remember <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few years ago</TIMEX> they made a movie of it and I thought, "I ought to go see that," but I guess it didn't do so well and it fizzled and I never saw it, no.
      
      
         Hum.
         Do ever go back and reread the things that you read when you were younger, now?
      
      
         <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Uh</ENAMEX>--
      
      
         Maybe not now but you know within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last four or five years</TIMEX>?
      
      
         Right.
         I don't re, remember rereading anything.
         Besides, um, things like, you know <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> off what I mentioned before, it would, it could be adult reading like, um, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A Separate Peace or Lord of the Flies</ENAMEX> I remember rereading those in college just because I wanted to reread them.
         <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Um</ENAMEX>, but I don't, I don't remember rereading anything that I read when I was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX> that, that I, that I reread as an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult</ENAMEX>.
      
      
         
         OK.
         
         <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Um</ENAMEX>.
         Do you, like now, um, I asked <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Megan</ENAMEX> the same question, but now do you, are there any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> stories that you either remember or, you like think are bizarre or you know, would like to hear again?
      
      
         
         
         Well, I mean, I don't think that, uh, my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> generally, doesn't sit around telling stories about what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> did <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX> or that kind of thing, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX>, there is one event I remember, um, no, I mean there's a few things, a few things I remember, or have memories of, but it isn't like anyone sits around telling stories about them.
         Certainly the memory I have is different than the stories that, that uh,
         the family swaps around the table or anything like that.
      
      
         
         So, like, you remember specific events?
      
      
         
         I remember general things, I remember <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time, we were at the shore, my fam, my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandfather</ENAMEX> had a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stone Harbor</ENAMEX> and there was a hurricane and I remember, um, you know, we moved all the furniture inside for the hurri, hurricane and we went out and he had an awning over his porch and, you know, and we, we double-tied the awning down.
         During the hurricane we'd go out and check to make sure that uh, uh, you know, all the strings were still tied and the awning wasn't going to blow away, but I don't remember, you now, I don't think we'd sit around and telling that story I mean, I occasionally mention that.
         "Do you remember?"
         "Does anyone remember that story?"
         That, that kind of thing that.
      
      
         You don't elaborate on it much?
      
      
         
         No, no, but I remember it, like, um, most of my memories of<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">, of</ENAMEX>, childhood memories, I guess were, were of that beach <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and you know, my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandmother</ENAMEX>, and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> and my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sisters</ENAMEX> would stay there during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the week</TIMEX> and then on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the weekend</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> would come down, like the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> meaning my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandfather</ENAMEX>, and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> and that kind of thing.
      
      
         Um hum.
      
      
         
         But, I don't remember, we, we, don't generally sit around and swapping stories about it, I mean, we just
         <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX> we were at, the whole <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> again, went to this time a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Carolina</ENAMEX> beach.
         My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mom</ENAMEX> rented a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> there and we, you know, I think at that point just because, you know, being at the beach I remember things and I would say, "You remember when we used to do this or that and the other thing and<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">?</ENAMEX>"
         We talked about some other things then, but it wasn't like we sat around telling hilarious tales and laughing over dinner and things like that.
      
      
         
         OK.
         Thank you very much.
      
      
         Well, you're welcome very much.
