 
     		
 	
 		all right
 	
 	
 		have you ever been drug tested
 	
 	
 		um
 		that's a good question um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i had a job i had to go get a blood test for
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">um</ENAMEX> and they and they did a full blood screen
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		on me but they didn't call that a drug test so that i think they checked for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> they just don't  tell you they did
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i had i've had uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two or three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> tests that i had to get before i could start working at a job
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh different jobs i had one at <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> and then <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> at another engineering <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> and
 		really i mean i don't mind them i don't do <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> anyway i guess if i did maybe i would but
 		um i don't know i know a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> that she's a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurse</ENAMEX> and they get drug tested randomly i've never been randomly drug tested
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but that would probably bother me to wake up <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX> and find out halfway through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> that you're going to be drug tested and you didn't know about it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well i guess it depends on if you got something to worry about
 	
 	
 		yeah i guess so
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i guess so
 		do you think that it's right
 	
 	
 		well uh uh i i come from kind of a biased opinion because i'm a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a therapist</NUMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> and alcohol counselor
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i've done employee <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assistant</ENAMEX> work and
 		i i know the the kind of cost <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX> go through in terms of accidents on the job
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		that are specifically <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> and alcohol related and it's like in the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">billions of dollars</NUMEX> every year
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">um</ENAMEX> and the the only way that they can prevent that is is you know making sure that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> and alcohol free
 	
 	
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		and you know the the problem in the work place is that that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are
 		like if your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boss</ENAMEX> is your drinking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buddy</ENAMEX> or whatever i mean you can come to come to work drunk and get in an accident and he'll cover up for you and nobody knows about it but could you know ends up costing the company <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lots</ENAMEX> and lots of money
 	
 	
 		right
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		so
 		you know there
 	
 	
 		i believe it's right especially for certain jobs
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i think anyone in a in a public job like <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bus</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drivers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cab</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drivers</ENAMEX> and police <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> and things like that i think they should be randomly drug tested i believe full force in that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i don't know that i believe every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX> in every <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> needs to be
 	
 	
 		true
 	
 	
 		you know <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretaries</ENAMEX> aren't aren't really going to cost the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> that much money if they fall face forward in their typewriter or something so
 		i don't know i i'm kind of biased too because i don't do <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> and so i really don't care one way or another if anybody wants to pull me up <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX> and test me because i have nothing to worry about
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so i guess that's kind of biased
 	
 	
 		yeah well and it's i i think one of the problems with it is it affects a lot of other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX> on the job
 	
 	
 		yeah it does
 	
 	
 		if somebody else is impaired because  generally you know it um you find out one way or another
 		if somebody's got a problem on the job
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true
 	
 	
 		and if even even if like you say even if it's just the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX> if her work or abilities start affecting her coworkers then it it's still a problem
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		but what do you do about the occasional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> that may have gone to a party <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three days</TIMEX> before and you know it's it's been the whole <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekend</TIMEX> since they've done anything and they happen to be tested <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and they could be fired for that
 		you know that that's kind of unfair also
 	
 	
 		well yeah i guess it comes with the turf
 	
 	
 		yeah i guess so i guess if you're going to do it you need to suffer the consequences
 	
 	
 		yeah and then you're
 		in in in terms of
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> they're illegal so you're
 	
 	
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		you're breaking the law anyway
 	
 	
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		um probably the the biggest problem with those is they don't do a real good job of of assessing for alcohol
 	
 	
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		and that's probably the biggest problem there is
 	
 	
 		yeah i think so more than drugs
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		and i know a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> that will put you in an alcohol rehabilitation before they would put you in a drug rehab
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		they would pay for an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> but they don't always pay for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> rehabilitation
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		well i guess that's one of the positive things that has has come out of it some of the employee assistance program if you do test positive for something
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		they will give you an opportunity opportunity opportunity to go get your life straight rather than to lose your job
 	
 	
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		and i think
 	
 	
 		i think that's fair
 	
 	
 		yeah and i think the benefits the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> benefits in the long run
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that's true
 		that's about all i have to say on it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		what what kind of testing do they do when you went
 	
 	
 		uh it's a urine test and they uh
 	
 	
 		urine screen yeah
 	
 	
 		it was really very official you have to go in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">room</ENAMEX> solely by yourself sign papers that say you were totally alone sign papers that say this is yours and
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and you have to fill the bottle yourself and label it yourself and all of that so that they're sure that you haven't borrowed anybody's i guess or something
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		well that happens
 	
 	
 		yeah i know i can't it's hard to believe but i guess it does
 	
 	
 		it happens a lot
 		there there are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that know pay other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> for that
 	
 	
 		i know i'm amazed at the things <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> will do
 	
 	
 		to help them out
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it is amazing i guess there are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that do that and they are those are expensive tests i'm glad i never had to pay for one
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah it depends really really really on how how strong a test it is they've got different <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">degrees as far as</NUMEX> as how far back they can check
 	
 	
 		yeah i guess so
 	
 	
 		they got some unusual things besides <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> and urine tests they've they've got some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> that are doing um hair tests
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yeah well that they'll pull out <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of your hairs and they can apparently test
 		um
 		back a certain period of time
 	
 	
 		how weird i didn't know  that
 	
 	
 		um because um some of the the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> ends up in your hair follicles you know it's kind of
 	
 	
 		oh that's weird
 	
 	
 		hair follicles i guess are just dead <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> and they
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and it it's apparently almost almost like a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a calendar</TIMEX> they they've got it
 		pretty precise now that they can go back and look at in terms of growth in a hair when you used and and that type of thing
 	
 	
 		that's wild
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		it's amazing the things they can find out from different things on your body
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		so i guess if they perfect that and then it's not quite as cumbersome as having to go fill a bottle or give <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> or something like that
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true
 		
 
 		that's true i'm glad i never had to do that by giving blood  i can't stand the thought of giving blood
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i can't even do it for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wadley</ENAMEX> even though it's a good cause
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		well i enjoyed talking to you
 	
 	
 		well i did too
 	
 	
 		thank you
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh</ENAMEX> bye bye
 	
 	
 		bye bye
