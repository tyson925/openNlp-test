 
     		
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> how you doing
 	
 	
 		all right
 	
 	
 		good good good have you been participating in this uh program very much
 	
 	
 		oh uh ever since they really got started
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		uh maybe a phone call <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a week</TIMEX> or something like that
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i try to get <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a day</TIMEX> and i'm leaving the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> here in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next week</TIMEX> and i wanna get every i want to get as many as i can
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh okay Bill you about ready to get started
 	
 	
 		i guess so
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">uh Bill</ENAMEX> what kind of a company you with
 	
 	
 		i'm with a  electronics company
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		uh
 		i've been an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineer</ENAMEX> all my life and uh
 		that's one of the the issues that i have with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> that uh you know salary is is one benefit but uh i feel as an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineer</ENAMEX> that uh
 		you know i take pride in my work and uh getting credit for that and recognition for the work that you do and uh having challenging work uh doing challenging assignments is one of the one of the payments that you get for your time
 		
  
 	
 	
 		right uh do do you think the benefits package is fair
 	
 	
 		i think our benefits package is pretty fair at the company
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but uh you know it's uh sometimes quite a struggle to uh to do work that's challenging and find challenging assignments
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i feel that one of the things that happens in this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> is that uh you know <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineers</ENAMEX> become what i call clerical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineers</ENAMEX> they spend their time pushing paper and doing mundane tasks that could be assigned to uh to other people
 	
 	
 		yeah you sound like you sound like my own situation uh how how old are you Bill
 	
 	
 		i'm uh fifty four
 	
 	
 		oh hey i'm fifty <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> sounds like same situation here
 		uh i'm with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> of course and our our benefits it it's interesting uh because that's one of the biggest gripes in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> is the benefits whether it be the health insurance or or the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> or  or other things
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh however recently i've had a chance to sample the outside and uh probably by industry standards we're probably in the top seventy percent
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh the uh uh i've i've really in fact what i'm doing is i'm uh retiring effective <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> and going with another company
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh primarily for some of the things that you stated uh i've spent uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> of my <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last ten years</TIMEX> in offshore <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i've just had a real ball
 		and uh since i've been back part of my job is is trouble shooting into the offshore <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">site plants</ENAMEX> which is okay but the other part  the other part's pushing paper
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh uh which i don't like i got the opportunity to go with another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> in fact uh a uh a semiconductor uh uh assembly <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> that supplies us uh where the uh where the job will be a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundred</NUMEX> percent going into their various plants trouble shooting
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and and i'm going to do that beginning the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">May</ENAMEX>
 		but uh uh interestingly interestingly interestingly enough though uh the the biggest grind i've been with i've been with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty two years</TIMEX>
 		uh the biggest gripe in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> is the benefits package but as i go looking at other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> as i've i've had a chance to do uh it's really not all that bad
 		uh the one of the biggest gripes of the benefit package is the insurance program and i guess they've all fallen <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victim</ENAMEX> to the high rising costs of medical care
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yes i think so
 	
 	
 		and and i i think that's the type of thing that uh uh that it that it amounts to uh what kind of vacation policy how long have you been with your <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bill</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i've been there <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty two years</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		thirty <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">two ha ha</NUMEX> sounds familiar  what kind of vacation uh uh restrictions do you have or or shouldn't say restrictions policy
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well after being there for this long i get uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four weeks a year</TIMEX> and i have an option to uh trade salary for an extra week
 	
 	
 		oh neat neat neat uh when when did you get into the uh uh when did you go through the break where you started getting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four weeks</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh let me see how does it work uh after you get <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks</TIMEX> up until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five years</TIMEX> and then you get an additional day uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</TIMEX> thereafter up until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten years</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and then thereafter every other year you get an additional day so by the time you've been there <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty years</TIMEX> you get the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four weeks</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		you get a full <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four weeks</TIMEX> yeah yeah we get <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks</TIMEX> after a year uh uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three three three weeks</TIMEX> between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> and fifteen and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four weeks</TIMEX> over fifteen
 	
 	
 		hum okay
 	
 	
 		and uh uh are you allowed to how many days are you allowed to accrue
 	
 	
 		none no carryover whatsoever
 	
 	
 		oh so you have to flush it out at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of every year</TIMEX> or or you lose it
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		okay well we've got we're allowed to accrue a fair bunch i'm not exactly sure uh on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year to year</TIMEX> basis what it is because i accrued most of mine before they put in the restrictions uh and then they they grandfathered our old days
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh but what it what it uh the bottom line is that when you die retire or quit the most you can get paid for is seventy days
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		which is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fourteen weeks</TIMEX> which is which is a pretty nice little bonus so i think with with retiring here in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next three days</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh i have eighty <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five days</TIMEX> vacation and and it would have been nice to been able to use up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fifteen</NUMEX> of them in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX> but i had so many things i had to do before i finished i didn't get to do that so i'm in essence going to be giving those back to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> or most of them back
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		but at least i get paid for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seventy days</TIMEX> which in your situation you don't i mean when you go out you probably get just the ones you have in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that current year</TIMEX> right
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX> that's interesting interesting
 	
 	
 		now we're allowed to accrue sick leave but uh
 	
 	
 		oh okay well see we we don't have any any such thing as sick leave uh if you're exempt and you've been here over
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three years or four years</TIMEX> or something like that you can be sick <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">up to six months</TIMEX> and still get paid and and and uh uh that uh do you have a uh long and short term disability program
 	
 	
 		hum okay
 		yes we do
 	
 	
 		yeah and we get <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half half</NUMEX> pay uh or full pay for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six months</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> pay for the remainder of the disability i guess how it works
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		and uh uh that's interesting how how many <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">vacation days</TIMEX> do y'all get
 	
 	
 		you mean uh mean holidays
 	
 	
 		yeah i meant holidays yeah
 	
 	
 		uh
 		i don't know the exact count uh they took away some of the minor <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">holidays a few years back</TIMEX> and we get <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas week</TIMEX> off
 	
 	
 		oh okay okay so it probably all adds up to the same
 	
 	
 		so yeah we traded in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Veterans Day</ENAMEX> and uh
 		and i guess <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Good Friday</ENAMEX> or something like that uh in favor of having a week off at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> i i'm not too enthusiastic about taking a vacation at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas time</TIMEX> because
 	
 	
 		yeah it
 		yeah yeah
 		no i guess that's true i i guess see most of us and like yourself where you've got <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four weeks</TIMEX> you can take plenty throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> and still have a week even if it weren't a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> holiday you'd still have some time left over at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Christmas</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh i i guess what happens is we don't have <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas week</TIMEX> we have <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> plus a day around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas a day before</TIMEX> or a day after as official holidays
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but there's so many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that are so senior and have so much time off so much vacation time coming that you will find virtually no one in the plant
 	
 	
 		well i think that's the reason our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> went that way what we we have uh a lot of government contract work and we find that in that last uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">couple of week of the year</TIMEX> all the government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are use it or lose it situation
 	
 	
 		yeah probably
 		yeah
 		yeah so they're all gone
 	
 	
 		yeah so all our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> are nonexistent
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah that's that's what happened to us i think the last <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last holiday</TIMEX> we got was in the middle uh seventies
 		and uh uh and that one was the uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thanksgiving</TIMEX> and i think the reason we got it for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a holiday</TIMEX> was nobody worked it anyway
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it just kept us from taking a day's vacation
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh we get we get uh <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">New Years Day Good Friday Memorial Day July Fourth Labor Day uh Thanksgiving</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> after and then <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> and a day either side of it
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		which which comes out to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about nine</NUMEX> and uh and and just since i've been here i mean when i got here we didn't even get <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Memorial Day</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		huh that's strange
 	
 	
 		and it it wasn't recognized here in the deep South
 		and we got uh uh and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Good Friday</ENAMEX> came along i think uh in about nineteen seventy we got a chance to vote on it and we had to vote on on that versus the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thanksgiving</TIMEX> because we didn't get <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that day</TIMEX> then
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		and i always felt that it wasn't a religious motive that gave us <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Good Friday the the the</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> voted for Good <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX> it was just that <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">New Years Day to Memorial Day</ENAMEX> was such a long stretch without a holiday it was nice to put <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> in there in the spring
 	
 	
 		yeah we're sort of in that situation we do get uh uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">George Washington</ENAMEX>'s birthday but it's still a long dry stretch from then until uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Memorial Day</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh okay so you
 		yeah are are you fairly satisfied with your health insurance
 	
 	
 		uh i'm kind of cross with it <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> we changed uh uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> for the plan we had been with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blue Cross and Blue Shield</ENAMEX> and uh we got to know them pretty well and how to work with the system
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but they've gone to a managed care program and we had to even even though we were right in the middle of the area we had to opt out because there are no <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> in the area that are taking patients
 	
 	
 		oh my goodness
 	
 	
 		and it's absolutely pathetic up here uh so far the insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> owes us <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about two thousand dollars</NUMEX> and the checks are not coming in
 	
 	
 		my goodness that's tough uh we had uh we've been with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aetna</ENAMEX> actually i think we find fund our own insurance program <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aetna</ENAMEX> just administers paying the bills
 	
 	
 		yeah that's the way our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> works
 	
 	
 		yeah and and and the uh uh they started out with having Managed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mental Health Care</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and then they went to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Managed Hospital Network</ENAMEX> where you had to go to a network <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> and we just got a notice <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the other day</TIMEX> saying that uh that we're going to have uh uh network <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and and they're going to the way they're going to work into this is they're going to look at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> that have been providing care for people
 		and uh write to them all and tell them that they've got an opportunity  to be part of this program and they and
 	
 	
 		yeah our in our area they all turned it down they say forget it uh if this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> wants to wants to go somewhere else let him go there
 	
 	
 		no kidding
