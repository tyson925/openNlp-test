 		anyway so what have what have you been into did you watch <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LA Law</ENAMEX> last night
 	
 	
 		uh no actually i i don't i i don't uh it's funny i don't really seem to watch a lot of television what um i usually like to pick up on TV are some of the
 		news type of shows like you know <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20/20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">60 Minutes</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um unfortunately a  couple of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekly</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">soaps</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Knots Landing</ENAMEX> and uh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> we watch
 		and uh and i usually uh i just other than those i i catch movies once in a while i like a lot of the movies that are you know true stories true to life that type of thing
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um but i'm not i'm not real big on that much on television uh i don't have really many favorite shows that i i must see <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every week</TIMEX> you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh part of that i think is uh i have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> and you know usually i don't get to sit down to watch the
 	
 	
 		they they they get first crack huh
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah so uh anyway um
 		but how about you then
 	
 	
 		well i usually i guess a lot of the sitcoms
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cosby Cheers</ENAMEX> uh
 	
 	
 		well i find i do sit down with them when they have those those they like a lot of those uh shows and often when they have them on
 	
 	
 		uh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		that's when they're quiet i like sit sit down with them and watch it yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A different A Different World</ENAMEX>
 		a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Different World</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but some of the other ones like i've been getting into L <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A Law</ENAMEX> and uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		do you watch uh Thirty Something
 	
 	
 		no i don't make a point i i guess i really never make a point to to watch anything i'll just end up catching it but uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		so you catch whatever might be on if you're interested <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">that evening</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah you know if i'm not doing that night uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know which i guess is usually <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">most nights</TIMEX> no
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		oh speaking of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">20/20</NUMEX> you didn't see the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> in with the exorcists exorcists
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		um i you know i wanted to and i forget i really i kept seeing it advertised and i wanted to see that and i don't know we might not have been home or something  excuse me and
 		i didn't see that but i was really interested in in that i i found that a pretty interesting story that they said the church recognized that as as a real exorcism
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">uh</ENAMEX> did you see that show
 	
 	
 		yeah i did
 	
 	
 		and what what did you think what did they what uh was that all about
 	
 	
 		oh well the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> that supposedly was possessed uh had actually uh you know seen uh you know something uh some medical the medical  side i don't know if it was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">psychologist</ENAMEX> or what all but
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um
 		you know it was interesting interesting it's interesting uh and uh
 		you know i'm from you know i'm was raised <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catholic</ENAMEX> fairly you know fairly fairly strong with my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mom</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> so
 	
 	
 		yeah my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> is too
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but it you know that's kind of interesting um but the bottom line it you know they did the exorcism it wasn't real major you know she she was fairly you know she you know obviously there she you know she something was wrong with her
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but uh it wasn't really uh
 		you know extraordinary as far as her actions
 		and she had done that and she felt like that helped her
 		but at the same time shortly after that exorcism they also started um
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		um uh giving her <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medication</ENAMEX> for like a split personality type stuff of
 	
 	
 		oh
 		okay
 	
 	
 		so uh she's doing better but and and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> herself you know believes that it you know that she was uh
 		you know possessed but and you know it it's hard to say
 	
 	
 		hum
 		it could be a multiple like one of these multiple personality disorders
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm not i'm not sure you know who knows but uh anyway it wasn't uh
 	
 	
 		also
 		yeah
 		huh
 	
 	
 		you know it was uh
 		it was you know
 	
 	
 		it wasn't as dramatic as i guess maybe they made it seem
 	
 	
 		well i i can't say it wasn't just because of the fact that that it's pretty
 		unusual for something like that to be nationally televised uh or or have anybody come in you know who who would want to have that televised you know if that was happening to your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		right
 		and well
 		right
 		right and also
 	
 	
 		and her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> are right there you know doing it all you know  so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">um</ENAMEX> and also for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> to recognize it as a a true exorcism you know um usually they're such i think i really think that there's a fine line between what um
 		you know a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> think is possessed and what are really mental <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disorders</ENAMEX> you know and maybe in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the old days</TIMEX> you know <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many years ago</TIMEX> what they often said oh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> were possessed we probably recognize now as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">schizophrenia</ENAMEX> or something
 	
 	
 		um
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">um</ENAMEX> and uh you know it's it's it's hard to to say you know whether
 		it's it's just a it's a mental disorder or it's really uh uh it's a or if it's a split personality or something
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		wait honey i can't talk right now  uh but um what i don't know now what area are you living  in
 	
 	
 		i'm in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Phoenix Arizona</ENAMEX> right now
 	
 	
 		oh  wait <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackie</ENAMEX> what
 		yes okay okay go    excuse me so
 	
 	
 		are you in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh no we are uh outside of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DC</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		and i was just the reason i asked that i was curious i thought maybe in different parts of uh you know the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> maybe there were certain shows that were more more popular than in other parts
 		and i know in this area it's i don't know <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DC</ENAMEX> is especially the newer areas are really known for having so many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">yuppies</ENAMEX> you know and a lot of them are into <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Thirty Something</ENAMEX> and you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh i don't know some of the other shows they watch <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">um Twin Peaks</ENAMEX>  you know and i'm not really into those shows and that really surprises people
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i i never got caught up in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Twin Twin Peaks</ENAMEX> either so
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah and i just i was just wondering demographically if you know if different parts if there were shows that were more popular than in other areas i don't know like where you live um you know what are the real
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		what are the hot shows you know that everybody seems to want to watch
 	
 	
 		uh i don't know i don't hear <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> talk at work you know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		as far as uh
 		you know what what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are getting into but
 		um
 		you know some of the top sitcoms obviously do you know always in the top <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> you know
 		the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cosby or i think A Different World</ENAMEX> is real strong and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		now that's funny see i haven't even heard of that show that's just
 	
 	
 		yeah well that's the one it's the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> right after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cosby</ENAMEX> and it's produced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Co</ENAMEX> sby and it's about it's basically about uh college
 	
 	
 		oh is that right so
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		you know and it it obvious it's you know since since it's kind of promoted by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cosby</ENAMEX> it's you know mostly blacks
 	
 	
 		i see uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but uh but it's it's a pretty good show it uh
 	
 	
 		and are all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> into the Simpsons
 	
 	
 		have you ever heard of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jasmine Guy</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		pardon me uh yes
 	
 	
 		okay now she's one of the main <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stars</ENAMEX> of that and now she's just come out came out with an album
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		and uh and which is fairly successful she's got <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one or two</NUMEX> singles that have done very well so
 		but she is a very strong personality in that show uh and uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		i see
 	
 	
 		it's your basic college and what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> run into and they in fact they just had a show covering <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		oh is that right
 	
 	
 		so you know they try to get their messages across i should say
 	
 	
 		yeah now there's a new show on and i can't think of the name of it apparently the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">producer</ENAMEX> of it was a
 		Potomac resident um you know which is right right around here close to where we we are living you know the Potomac
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		area outside of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DC and</ENAMEX> and i i think he went to like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wooton High School</ENAMEX> here or something and and some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX> that circulating the rumor  that
 		this show is based upon stories that actually happened at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Wooton High</ENAMEX> where he went and that's and he she denies some of it you know um i oh
 		eh eh i eh it might be the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beverly Hills</ENAMEX> um there's that one called <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beverly Hills</ENAMEX> one <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> or something like that uh
 	
 	
 		um not sure
 	
 	
 		and uh that's becoming a little popular and of course the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> all like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Simpsons</ENAMEX> here
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh i guess it's the same there also
 	
 	
 		yeah uh that one is is it still competing with <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cosby</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um i'm not sure i don't know what's happened uh i know a lot of some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> won't let their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> watch it  you know uh
 	
 	
 		such a brat
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah but um it what what uh
 		what changes would you like to see i mean in in in you know evening television do you think there should be more like news type programs like <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">20/20</ENAMEX> or more comedies or weeklies
 	
 	
 		honestly i'm indifferent
 		i probably i probably will watch a little bit of everything uh i i i i get into movies i'll uh i'll see you know i'll watch <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20/20</NUMEX> or i'll
 	
 	
 		you're indifferent it doesn't matter
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh you know i guess i'm only mostly into sitcoms i guess my favorite you know one show i'm really into is <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Arsenio Hall</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh-huh oh yeah i watch that uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		and then you know i've been watching him for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a long time now</TIMEX> and i i needed a break and i watched <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnny Carson</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">last night</TIMEX> a little more level you know  and so it's like i'm just
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		think oh what do i feel like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> you know we're getting option our options on different talk shows and i always liked watching <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Letterman</ENAMEX> but he starts so late
 	
 	
 		you so you like some of these late shows
 	
 	
 		yeah well the the talk shows with the personality yeah and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah talk shows yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Letterman</ENAMEX> starts pretty late out here <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about twelve o'clock</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		right oh oh okay
 	
 	
 		but i'll still watch it once in a while
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah um i guess so i think also probably because <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> now there are so many
 		uh  everybody has VCR's and rents so many movies that might have i don't know that might have hurt some of the the popularity of certain shows you know a lot of things that they put on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">nights</TIMEX> a lot of people
 	
 	
 		yeah
