 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		um i was thinking about the uh the topic you know while they were searching for a person
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh while i was thinking about it i just flipped on my TV
 		and it was funny because i thought about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> how so much of
 		i mean i even my social life is renting movies or sitting at home and you know watching a rented movie or watching a movie on TV
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and just now it's so i mean every everything is just so uh easy that you almost don't have to think of things to do anymore
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know what i mean
 	
 	
 		i do and like even even little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> who watch like <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Sesame Street</ENAMEX> and everything's really fast <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">paced</ENAMEX> and they don't have to to sit down and concentrate on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> thing for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a long time</TIMEX> and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i mean i remember when i was little my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> uh my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> i'm sorry would just go over <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> and just sort of you know sit and talk
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and before TV and all that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> would sit and listen to the radio and and that i mean life has just changed and become so much more modernized and uh it's really pretty incredible
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah just <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the other day</TIMEX> i uh some AM <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX> or something had a um
 		like a radio show just like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the old days</TIMEX> you know it was like from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the old days</TIMEX> and i was thinking gosh that's i mean because you have to imagine what everybody looks like and you don't understand it until you actually hear it and have to do it and it's i mean you know it's just too bad that everybody has everything fed to them
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		i know
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		and you know when you think about oh i was watching reruns of Happy <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Days the other day</TIMEX> and um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		to think that that was the social life of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teenagers</ENAMEX> to go to uh you know a a place like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arnold's</ENAMEX> and order a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">soda</ENAMEX> pop
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh you know sit and hang out and and you know just the dress codes the whole atmosphere the whole attitude of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teenagers</ENAMEX> and social life was totally different then
 	
 	
 		yeah i mean now we always have to do something new or better or more exciting can't just sit around and talk for awhile you know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		i know
 	
 	
 		it's too bad
 	
 	
 		i know and also um i think that it's so much more dangerous for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> now
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i mean before you could go out and and you know you didn't have all the drunk <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drivers</ENAMEX> and you didn't have to worry about your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> getting into the wrong crowds and this and that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and now that's really a problem
 	
 	
 		yeah it really is
 	
 	
 		you know  but what what do you do most of the time for social activities
 	
 	
 		um just
 		well i'm fifteen so
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		oh just a lot of times we do sit around and
 		because like uh i'm really glad that i'm in like uh the classes uh like honors classes and so it's like what's really good about that is that you meet <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who really are interested in in talking about things and discussing world issues and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yes
 		yes
 	
 	
 		it just and it makes me sick to go to school and know <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who just that's all they do is like go out and  you know try to go find a new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> or something it's just so immature and oh just futile you know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah i i definitely agree
 		um are your you can't drive yet then can you
 	
 	
 		no i'll be driving in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few months</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		okay oh in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few months</TIMEX> you said oh that's good well you're going to find that driving changes your social life completely
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i mean suddenly when you're free to go where you want to go it's amazing i mean i don't know if you'll always have a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> around that's a different issue
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but um uh just even being able to go to a movie when you want and and not relying on somebody else it's really pretty nice
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah it is
 	
 	
 		
 
 		but um
 		one thing i love to do and maybe it's just  because i like to eat
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of my favorite things to do with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> is just go out and try a new restaurant
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh and i don't know just go and i don't know try like a a new ethnic restaurant you know <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> or or something like that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i think so often we do social things like you were saying you know going out and picking up <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> or or whatever social things that don't really
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		are that aren't really social like when you go to a movie you're not sitting and talking to anybody
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and when you go to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX> it's usually so loud or so crowded that you even that you can't talk to anybody
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know um and going out to dinner i think is a nice way you're out you're out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i think playing games is something that my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> and i love to do
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		we've um we've bought <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pictionary</ENAMEX> you probably know that and i don't know some other games and um and i know this sounds kind of corny but
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		it was it does sound corny but it's so much fun
 	
 	
 		it really is
 		and if you get the right <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		they have a good attitude about it then you know you can have a pretty good time
 	
 	
 		yeah you really can
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		awesome
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i personally think that i should have been born in the fifties because i do i do love that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">era</TIMEX> and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i really think that i could have gotten into i don't know the the music and the lifestyle and um things just seemed so much easier didn't they
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		you know it just seems like you didn't have so much to worry about
 	
 	
 		i know everybody's i mean everybody's always busy and worried and so many problems <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> don't just sit down and you know just talk and know everything's going to be okay
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah that's true
 		well who knows maybe another maybe the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the twenty first century</TIMEX> will bring a whole new type of social life
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah things go in cycles you know maybe
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i get very frustrated when i go over to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and all they want to do is sit and play computer games
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		you know i i don't know if you're familiar with any of them but
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		they're they're fun you know and they're they're you know not bad to like take up some time but they just are so um exclusive
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		you know you get <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in front of a computer playing a computer game and the the next <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> could be on fire
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and they'll never know it you know
 	
 	
 		oh that 's the truth
 	
 	
 		
 
 		but
 		
 
 		well it was nice talking to you
 	
 	
 		yeah nice talking to you
