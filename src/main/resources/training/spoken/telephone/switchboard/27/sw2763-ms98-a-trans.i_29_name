 
     		
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">okay Nancy</ENAMEX> what do you think about drug testing
 	
 	
 		i'm all for it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		because i i think if you don't do it you don't have anything to worry about it
 	
 	
 		all right
 	
 	
 		and i don't do <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> so i never worry about it and i i think it's a i think it's a good idea i i even think the random is fine you know
 		you shouldn't do it and that's  in a nutshell and i think you know i say if you if you don't do it you really really don't have to worry it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah do you feel that
 		see i don't know what questions to ask because i'm i agree with you and i was hoping to find someone that disagreed so i could so i i could fire questions at them
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		well i you just uh like i say i just think it's a a fine idea and i the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> that i've heard that had a random testing i think it's a great idea uh where i work they don't
 	
 	
 		but
 	
 	
 		do random testing and uh now when i hired in i had to have a uh
 		a drug test which was fine with me i i wasn't worried at all about that  but and then i think that's perfectly i don't think it's infringing on your rights or i think the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> has a right to have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> that are drug free
 	
 	
 		right
 		what do you think <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> should do if they find someone that
 		tests positive
 	
 	
 		well
 		i guess i'd give them
 		i'd give them <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> chance maybe i i don't know person i'd fire if it was my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> i'd fire them right then but not you know in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s society you can't do that yeah i guess you guess have to give them a a warning and then then the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> time they'd be terminated
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		if they tested positive
 		and i really would watch them after that but uh
 	
 	
 		would you help them get into a drug rehab program
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i'd probably send them on a EAT program you know Employee Assistance Program i'd i'd make them go through that
 		and uh the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time they'd have to go through the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EAT</ENAMEX> program
 		and i think most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> have those  now i think they have it must be a law or something because awful lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> have them
 		and i'd make them do that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and if they refused to do that then they'd be fired
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> i'd do it what would you do
 	
 	
 		uh probably about the same thing just uh
 		give them a chance you know with a positive have them sit down with their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boss</ENAMEX> and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boss</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boss</ENAMEX> and uh you know just talk with them about
 		what happened what the problem was
 		possibility there's a possibility that uh
 		you know you've got to give somebody a benefit of the doubt because everybody would probably say oh well that's just you know i just tried it once to see what it'd be like
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		or maybe it's a my <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antihistamine</ENAMEX> i was on that  you know tested positive i i don't do it you know you never know if they're telling the truth or not
 	
 	
 		yeah so you pretty much got to give everybody <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> shot
 	
 	
 		<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> chance yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		and then after that you might want to
 		and and if they admit to having a problem or something you know i would help them out as as long as they wanted help and would stay in the program i'd you know help them out
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right
 		right
 		but if they flat refused you know and said no i won't then i'd say well then i'm sorry then you can't say we're not going to have druggies in our payroll the way i'd look at it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right
 	
 	
 		fortunately i've never had to worry about that since i i have never even
 		tried uh a puff or whatever it uh you know and if somebody gave me a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">thousand dollars</NUMEX> and said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nancy</ENAMEX> go by some dope i wouldn't even know where to go buy it i'm sure you can at any high school or any street corner they tell me but i don't know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		what if along a similar topic straying from the drug thing what about
 		what do you think about <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> testing for
 		uh say you're a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX> and uh a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> comes in and wants treated should you have the right to test them for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh
 		i guess if he suspected sure i wouldn't because if i was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX> i wouldn't want to
 		test them i mean i wouldn't want to treat them for fear that they would you know i i'd get that but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i think if if you suspect it and i'm sure a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> can look at somebody and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">suspect</ENAMEX> don't you think by looking at them
 	
 	
 		in advanced cases yes
 	
 	
 		yeah not probably not at the first i don't know
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i don't know if you if they have the right or not
 		i never had never really thought of that
 	
 	
 		see that's a question i'm wondering because i'm pursuing a career in medicine
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and you know they're deciding that in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX> you know as i'm continuing my education
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so it would you know by the time i get out and begin practicing then
 		i don't know you you know or could be either way i would definitely want to know if these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> i mean i'm the
 	
 	
 		you're right
 		oh i would too absolutely absolutely i just don't uh
 	
 	
 		but
 		and
 	
 	
 		and i would if i were a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> i wouldn't
 		i i don't think it's anything wrong for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> to refuse to i don't care about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hippocratic</ENAMEX> oath i don't think they should have to treat a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> if they don't want to you know why take a chance like that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> that got infected from a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> and you know she ended up i think
 		she died i don't remember if she died or not but she's suing that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> because
 		uh she was working with uh with a <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> that got them
 		so i i don't know i don't think i would uh
 	
 	
 		that's
 	
 	
 		treat one
 	
 	
 		it's such a tough issue i i just wanted to throw that out to you to make the conversation a little more interesting because since we both agree it's kind of hard to
 	
 	
 		
 
 		you're
 		isn't that totally boring
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		oh me well uh no i like i say i've only been tested the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time when i hired in uh i had was tested for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>
 		and of course they do everybody you can't work where i work unless you're tested for it and so that you know and that was fine with me but they make you do all the sealing you know you you have to do everything yourself they're not allowed to seal them or
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		tag them or anything you you do it all yourself they tell you what to do but you do it all yourself
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		so if there's a mistake it's your mistake i guess
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i don't know
 	
 	
 		uh you work for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		no i did <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seventeen years</TIMEX> i worked uh in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fort Worth</ENAMEX> at a a landing gear <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> Menasco
 	
 	
 		oh oh
 	
 	
 		and uh love it just love it i wish i'd f ound this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty years ago</TIMEX> but
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		so i started out at <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX> my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> works at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TI</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		is that how you got on the
 	
 	
 		yeah because she was on it and she how did you get on it
 	
 	
 		phone program
 		my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> works for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> yeah
 	
 	
 		oh does she
 		yeah i liked <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> i loved it i quit quit back in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eighty five</NUMEX> uh and went with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Martin Marietta</ENAMEX> down in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Orlando</ENAMEX>
 		and just hated <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Orlando Orlando</ENAMEX> just oh yeah just hated it couldn't wait to get back and it took me about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">almost four years</TIMEX> to get back but i made it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and  but i've almost doubled my salary since leaving <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> now that's how bad <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> pays i have almost doubled my salary i really have and i
 	
 	
 		yeah wow
 	
 	
 		uh but i love <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> i really i really enjoyed working there and uh
 		but you know it wasn't to be anymore
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		had to move on
 		but uh yeah they you know i know they do the random testing at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TI</ENAMEX>
 		and i i i don't see anything wrong with that
 		if you know if they i don't even know they don't even have to do it on suspicion they can they can just do it and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and they do it quite often i understand
 		and i don't blame them at all i mean
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> and
 		you're a danger to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> if you're on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> and i think you're a danger to to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that you work with and then they have too much sophisticated equipment out there to have somebody out you know doped up working around it i think
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		so uh
 		and i understand that they even if even if you see somebody off you know away from work using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		that you can come back and and rat on them and they'll get them that way
 		if you see them at a party to you know doing dope you can go back to work and tell on them
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		is what i've understand i've heard
 	
 	
 		well it's pretty serious
 	
 	
 		yeah it is they're they're cracking down on them but uh that's good you know somebody needs to get tough on these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> you know and you know and they
 		take them to court and then they just slap them on the hand and let them the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX> out and you know i just makes me sick i  that's why we have so much crime i know it's because of dope
 	
 	
 		yeah a lot of it is for sure
 	
 	
 		i know when i was
 		growing up you could sleep with your windows open well even my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> were growing up we didn't lock our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> we just went to bed you know and left the doors open the windows open you could walk take walks at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> you can't do that anymore
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		and i think most of it's drug related most of the crime that we have is drug related
 		and uh i i don't i don't think my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> have ever
 		if they did i didn't know it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but i know they've never been on it if they ever tried it i didn't know it and because my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> was a
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">athlete</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">athletes</ENAMEX> normally can't
 		don't do it because they're you know they have to stay in shape my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX>  my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> just wasn't the type she just didn't care for stuff like that and neither one of them smoked cigarettes either so that's that's
 	
 	
 		right
 		well that's good
 	
 	
 		yeah i really is i did when they were growing up and i think that's why they don't because i did and i quit about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten years ago</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and it was the smartest thing i ever did
 	
 	
 		yeah good
 	
 	
 		took shots from a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Richardson</ENAMEX>
 		and haven't had a puff since
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		she gave shots in the nose and in the ears and in the arm <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> shots and that's it never smoked again
 	
 	
 		
 
 		wow
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		well that's good
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm real proud of myself
