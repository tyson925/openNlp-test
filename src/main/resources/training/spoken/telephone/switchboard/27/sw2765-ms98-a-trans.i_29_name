 
     		
 	
 		
 
 		i was afraid for a while she wasn't going to find anyone because they were all out on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">golf course</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh really well it's it's raining in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> right now in my area so there's probably not any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">golfers</ENAMEX> out on the course
 	
 	
 		
 
 		okay
 		oh
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		yeah i
 	
 	
 		they just they just said that the uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Byron Nelson Tournament</ENAMEX> here had been suspended
 	
 	
 		oh no
 	
 	
 		for because of rain of course that's just for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> it'll it'll play again finish <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX> you know or finish <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s round tomorrow
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> you're used to playing <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">golf</ENAMEX> in the wind too
 	
 	
 		oh right yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		well i i'm not really much of a golfer i have not played golf in probably fifteen <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> but uh it it is an intention to take up the  the uh sport again
 	
 	
 		the biggest problem with it i think is time
 	
 	
 		right uh
 	
 	
 		yeah and i i know that it's a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">four hour</TIMEX> dedication
 		it could be <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">four hour</NUMEX> relaxation or it could be gritting on your nerves which you're using that much time
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> and not not having that much fun
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right well yeah if if you're good at it i guess it's a
 		not so much frustration but if you are it it you know if you're not a really good golfer it it can be real frustrating real frustrating
 	
 	
 		you know and i i played tennis for exercise but i play <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">golf</ENAMEX> for fun uh and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		apparently it's the attitude that you have that makes the big difference
 		the uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i i enjoy catching it too do you ever go out to the
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well i it's been a while since i've been out to watch i do watch a little on TV you know when i have the chance but uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		i keep wondering why i you can understand in sports like uh basketball or baseball or football there's an age
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh position in there but i keep wondering why
 		some of the real legends can't go just a little bit longer than they do
 	
 	
 		well you know i wonder that too in watching some of these senior tournaments uh you know the uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">seniors</ENAMEX> skins and stuff like that on TV you see how well they're playing and you and you wonder why they're they're not able to you know to play with
 	
 	
 		right
 		
 
 		
  
 		it the regular tour
 	
 	
 		with the with the younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> on the regular tour
 	
 	
 		and they do mix some of them mix it but it's uh it it does amaze me sometimes just to see it i don't know whether it's a lack of concentration
 		or particular muscle development or what but it seems to be uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i to me it's not a sport that you would
 		be overwhelmed with muscle activity in it
 	
 	
 		right well as i understand it and of course it's like i said it's been a while since i played but uh as i understand it as you do get older that your concentration in the putting area you know really suffers and
 		that's that's the primary reason that some of these older that you know that the old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX> don't play as well
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but uh
 	
 	
 		i tell you what it's a sport that has a great number of jokes though
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i
 	
 	
 		i as i said i play <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">tennis</ENAMEX> and there are no tennis jokes i don't know if you can think of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> at all
 	
 	
 		i guess come to think of it i've never heard a tennis joke
 	
 	
 		
 
 		but but there are a slew of <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">golf</ENAMEX> jokes so it it indicated and it's great uh sport for equalizing the handicap system
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		allows you to play competitively even though you don't play on the same level play competitively
 		with just about anyone you know i can go out and stand a chance of winning a dime off of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Nicholas</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh if
 		the handicap system uh worked properly and it should so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's nice to be able to to uh compete
 		and and be together with someone
 		and yet
 		have a basis for competitiveness such as uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> cent be anything over a a dime i joke on so
 	
 	
 		and perhaps and perhaps even learn a little bit of something
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh yes oh yeah
 	
 	
 		it's interesting we're talking about golf the television own in my den right now and i'm watching a ball roll <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">up about four inches</NUMEX> from the hole  in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Byron Nelson</ENAMEX> so
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well you know that's one of the other things i i'd i'm am fascinated sometimes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sports bring it to mind more quickly than any others but all the other
 		functions that the human body performs really are are uh
 		as equally amazing But when you start thinking about the eye hand coordination and trying to get a little sphere
 		uh <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">four hundred and twenty yards</NUMEX> away into a little whole in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about four</NUMEX> shots
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and it's true you have loft of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">club</ENAMEX> and everything else but knowing how far to bring it back and the
 		the concentration and all the things that go on in the human body to get it there
 	
 	
 		there's a awful lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mechanics</ENAMEX> involved in
 	
 	
 		yeah the same the same thing is true with <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">basketball</ENAMEX> where a a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fellows</ENAMEX> running along and runs and jumps up in the air and then pushes the basketball toward uh a hoop and it swishes through
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		the the the human body is amazing and i think i'd like to see
 		uh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> like that in almost everything i do and golf
 		uh i walk down the fairways sometimes just thinking about that and then of course i'll miss the putt
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah so well what uh what course do you get to play on over in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Carolina</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but
 		we just moved here from from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oklahoma</ENAMEX> as a matter of fact and i'd been in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oklahoma</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty years</TIMEX> up in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Enid</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but so uh i'm used to the wind too
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		in fact that's the only that areas the only place i know of that you really have to uh consider the wind on putts  out on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">grass</ENAMEX> green and everything else but the wind effect
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		yeah but i guess in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Carolina</ENAMEX> you you're in an area where there are some really nice courses
 	
 	
 		oh i know it i know we had just moved to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Charlotte</ENAMEX> and uh i've gone to a couple of uh public courses uh we haven't settled in here yet we're just
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		here temporarily but
 		a
 		the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX> are beautiful and you can play just <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about year</TIMEX> round on it too
 	
 	
 		yeah that's
 	
 	
 		now <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richardson</ENAMEX> maybe you can too
 	
 	
 		yeah right <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Richardson h</ENAMEX> as it's you know it's pretty close to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> round there are times uh well i guess that there are times in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the winter</TIMEX> you know when you can't play but then there are times when
 		you know when it thaws out and warms up and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> flock to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">golf course</ENAMEX> you know in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January</TIMEX> so
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		in fact uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last few years</TIMEX> i've had
 		in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oklahoma</ENAMEX> i went to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norman</ENAMEX> and it would play <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">New Year</TIMEX>'s day down there now there it was stretching the imagination to enjoy it
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but at least i played
 	
 	
 		yeah probably <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a week later</TIMEX> it was warm enough you could have gone out and played and really enjoyed it even then so
