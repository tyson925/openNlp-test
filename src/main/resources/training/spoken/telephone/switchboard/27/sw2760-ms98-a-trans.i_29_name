 
     		
 	
 		all righty
 		okay have you recently had to return anything
 	
 	
 		yes i have
 	
 	
 		okay tell me about it
 	
 	
 		well i have a VCR and i've had to return it a couple of times because of the same part failure
 		and uh
 		it's still not getting a real good picture
 	
 	
 		oh my goodness
 	
 	
 		and after
 		<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about three hundred dollars</NUMEX> i think it's going to be worth it just to go ahead and get a new machine
 	
 	
 		you mean it the warranty wasn't on it or
 	
 	
 		so
 		well i didn't get the extended warranty it was out of warranty just barely so uh
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		gosh
 	
 	
 		so how about you
 	
 	
 		well i haven't had to return anything recently but i you know i feel  i'm going to i'm on a portable phone i'm going to go closer to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX>  here uh
 		i i feel like things are are not made as well as they used to be i um just cause you for instance clothing i you know i have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and um
 		we we say they they like nice clothing and i spend a lot of money on it and it just doesn't last and i mean i'm very careful to follow the washing instructions and do exactly
 		what it says and it still still it they still wear out very quickly uh i find things that are sewn very poorly uh they they come come unhemmed or unstitched so easily
 	
 	
 		well i will agree with that we've had some run ins especially with buttons as soon as you get them home the buttons fall off after the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time and uh the threads on the inside of the garments
 	
 	
 		right right
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		seem like they're just they don't cut threads off they're just a wads of threads and stitching does come undone you know fairly soon and then the prices you pay for them are ridiculous
 	
 	
 		they never cut him off
 		oh i know it's really it's silly and and my i have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teenagers</ENAMEX> and they
 		they think they want a certain brand or a certain item well
 		when you buy a brand name that's popular you're paying for the brand name and
 	
 	
 		not only that but they're no better than a lot of the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the the</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		non name brand stuff so
 	
 	
 		exactly that's what i you know i'm saying that the you know if i'm paying for the name and i'm paying that much money it'd better be
 		a quality product now i do there's there are some that i think are a little bit better
 		and i and i've been real pleased with them and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> are have enjoyed wearing them and they've lasted until they've outgrown them
 		but uh the majority of things um don't last and they're just very inferior
 		and you know i try i try to look at the labels and i try i try to
 		to buy things that are made in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX> because i think that's important and yet i find a lot of the the
 		the homemade goods are are inferior and also with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> i um
 		i i bought a new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last summer</TIMEX> and i shopped around for a long time i mean we went to a lot of different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX> and i wanted to buy an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> because i had had a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toyota</ENAMEX> and i really liked it but i felt like
 		i needed to buy buy something that was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX> made because i felt i owed that well i just could not find an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> made <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> that i felt
 		was worthy of the price they wanted and um i ended up buying another
 		i ended up buying a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> and i love it
 	
 	
 		well  the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> just haven't gotten the message yet that's one thing because i'm i'm the same way we i do own an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">huh-uh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		car well a truck but uh in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trucks</ENAMEX> i think you're pretty safe but in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> i've not had an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> that i've been really pleased with
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh i know
 	
 	
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> for gas mileage and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> uh the reliability things falling off the inside uh you know frequent tune-ups every foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> i've ever made i mean that i've ever bought i've i've loved it
 	
 	
 		exactly
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah and they're so much more solid they sound better when you're in them they feel you feel like you're
 		in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> and not rattling around in something i you know i just  i just am real pleased with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> i had and i had a
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Subaru</ENAMEX> before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toyota</ENAMEX> and i loved that it was just the best car i've ever had in fact i wanted to buy <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">another another one</NUMEX> but i
 		really it really what didn't have what i wanted they didn't have the the type of family car i wanted but that car i had for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five years</TIMEX> and
 		i never had one thing go wrong with it and it um
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only</NUMEX> thing i had to have replaced was the clutch and i had to do that twice because it was my fault because i ride it all the time and uh so you know it wore out
 	
 	
 		well clutches are something that you really can't judge i mean they they some go out faster than others and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know that's those kind of items like that wear items there's no way you can judge
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		uh like brakes uh i we have a a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Volvo</ENAMEX> and the brakes go out on it on <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about every fifteen thousand miles</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true
 		is that right
 	
 	
 		it's just inherent for that car but the the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> is super
 	
 	
 		oh i know i've heard great things
 	
 	
 		i'd rather put the brakes on it and uh and have the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the reliability</TIMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> itself but uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh yes and it's a safe <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> too it's a good made car
 	
 	
 		for the most part it's been a good car we've had it for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six years</TIMEX> now
 	
 	
 		oh that's great well that the the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Subaru i</ENAMEX> had when i sold it it still had the tires
 		the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factory</ENAMEX> tires on it and the factory battery one i mean that's how good it was i never had one trouble with the battery and which is amazing in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five years</TIMEX> i didn't have to get a new one and it worked perfectly
 		and it was amazing the tires were um excellent and uh you know when i sold it it didn't have that many it was low mileage i didn't think i had like thirty <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">seven thousand miles</NUMEX> on it which is
 		nowadays low but uh i got a good price on it it's got good resale value and it was really a good car
 		and you know it it kind of is frightening i think that you're right <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturers</ENAMEX> still haven't got the the idea that that quality is important and that
 	
 	
 		well if you can see the transition what i'm beginning to see is that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> and and even just foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> in as a whole are beginning to
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		get larger but they're able to keep the gas mileage and the reliability whereas the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> are beginning to scale down but the gas mileage doesn't improve drastically
 	
 	
 		yes
 		right
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		you're right you're right
 	
 	
 		and that right there ought to tell them something
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		i know we have the technology but i think it's the the glut of the oil <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> and and uh big business and the government
 	
 	
 		um-hum yes
 	
 	
 		in trying to control things that they shouldn't control and
 		uh they're not controlling the things they should control
 	
 	
 		exactly
 	
 	
 		so i think there's a there's a lot of things there to be said and
 		uh i will continue to buy
 		foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> if that's the most reliable product especially when i'm paying for it
 	
 	
 		that's right
 		that's right because you
 	
 	
 		and i and i hate to have that attitude but i do
 	
 	
 		well the thing is when you have to take your <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> in continually because it's not working and pay that much money in repair
 		price bills it's ridiculous i i had a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Plymouth</ENAMEX> that was just the worst <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> in the world and i mean everything that could go wrong with it went wrong with it i had it in to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">dealership</ENAMEX> more than i had it out it was terrible and i got rid of it as fast as i could it was the most
 		it was a lemon is what it was and uh you know i will never buy a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Plymouth</ENAMEX> again simply because of that
 	
 	
 		oh i know i'm the same way with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> i won't buy a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> car
 	
 	
 		is that right
 	
 	
 		yeah i like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trucks</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and then i like the foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> especially <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Honda</ENAMEX> i've had a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Honda</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh i've heard good things about a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Honda</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		that i liked and uh i mean it was super car
 	
 	
 		yeah my niece has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> and she loves it too yeah
 	
 	
 		so i think you know
 	
 	
 		but you really liked your <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> truck huh
 	
 	
 		well it's been a good <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">truck</ENAMEX> so far it's only got a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">forty two thousand miles</NUMEX> on it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and so far so good
 		don't know what's going to happen when it gets <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">another twenty</TIMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">thirty thousand miles</NUMEX> on it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well i'm looking for a used <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">truck</ENAMEX> for my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> and it's it's really been hard because we i we just don't have that much money to spend
 		to spend he just turned <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixteen</TIMEX> uh you know i don't i want to get an inexpensive truck a small one that um you know i only have to pay a couple of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousand</NUMEX> or you know <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">three thousand</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh boy
 		well <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trucks trucks</ENAMEX> keep they hold their value
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		pretty much and and even used <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trucks</ENAMEX> are pretty expensive
 	
 	
 		yeah they are we did find a couple but um
 		you know they just i wasn't real sure about them and uh so we we kind of passed them up um this one <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> is not
 		is trying to make up my his mind whether he wants to sell his it's a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitsubishi</ENAMEX> and it's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an eighty five</NUMEX> and he wants to sell it for <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about two thousand</NUMEX>
 		but uh he's not sure he wants to give it up and start car payments again so we're kind of waiting for him to make that decision but
 	
 	
 		oh i can't i can certainly understand that i don't want any car payments either in fact when <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mine</ENAMEX>'s paid off and
 	
 	
 		you know
 		oh
 	
 	
 		our other one's paid off uh i don't want to get another car until they just both fall apart
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah they're car payments are outrageous now
 	
 	
 		well it's it's just anymore they don't benefit you uh from the income tax stand point
 	
 	
 		oh that's right
 	
 	
 		and uh of course we just can't afford to trade <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> like that so
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">hum-um hum-um</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		we're just going to make it go as far as it can and then when we're forced to get one we will
 	
 	
 		well that's why it's important to find a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> that you don't have to keep taking in for repairs because if you're gonna keep it a long time
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		are you i mean shoot you don't want to spend <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">thousands of dollars</NUMEX> on repairs
 	
 	
 		which can be easily done these days
 	
 	
 		yes easily easily and you know that another thing about
 		not only about uh you know products but
 		services  you're not real sure of anymore you you take a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> in and you think it's fixed or and and how do you know if they really even fixed it and and sometimes i wonder you know and it's kind of scary
 		you just you're not sure
 	
 	
 		where where are you from
 	
 	
 		i'm from i'm originally from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX> and where are you now
 	
 	
 		i'm in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you're in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah
 	
 	
 		i was going to say because uh i was going to say if you're up in the in the northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX> would be a big factor on i didn't know how much how they take care of the warranty items when it comes down to corrosion and that sort of thing
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		yeah it's uh bad up there but i'm i've been in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirteen years</TIMEX> now so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		what are what part of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> are you from
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> from Coppell
 	
 	
 		Coppell i'm from Plano
 	
 	
 		Plano
 	
 	
 		we're not yeah we're not too far away
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		fact my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> lives in Plano
 	
 	
 		is that right oh well
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		but
 	
 	
 		i don't  have much more to say about things i i feel the same way that you do though i think it things are you know need to get better and i think you need we need to have somehow more of a trust in in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> made goods and it's sad that we don't but uh
 	
 	
 		i would i would certainly like to And i hope that that before it's too late they do get the message
 		and i i don't know i think a lot of it has to do with uh
 		you know just the attitude of the
