 		uh i've originated <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only a a few</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh okay yeah
 	
 	
 		but i've received quite a few
 	
 	
 		i uh i only started doing it after uh i started getting calls and said oh heck that's right i'm supposed to make a few calls so i started
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about month ago</TIMEX> and i this is getting close to <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty</TIMEX> here which i think is about all
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh our little gift book goes up to but i don't really know
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		i've got about twelve tickets in the mail do you have you've  a few
 	
 	
 		yeah i've been getting mine
 	
 	
 		okay uh medical go ahead i'm i'm medical that's mine
 	
 	
 		uh you pushed the record button we're supposed to be discussing the subject
 	
 	
 		yeah i i'm benefits go ahead you first
 	
 	
 		yeah uh well i'll tell you i've
 		been around for quite <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few years</TIMEX> and worked for a lot of different <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> and uh it's hard to beat any of the benefits that or salaries either
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		that we get from <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> i'm quite pleased with it
 		course there's a few things that uh i think i could do better if i was sitting up in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">CEO</ENAMEX>'s seat but um
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		i think <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerry</ENAMEX>'s doing a pretty good job as it goes
 	
 	
 		the one it's kind of like uh automobile insurance the ones uh that i think are the highest and important to me
 		uh i hope i never have to use them really per se although i've used medical a little bit uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		that well that one certainly is high i i worry that it's weakening rather than strengthening so i like to reverse that trend and say i'd like to get those to strengthen you know be better and better
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		then salary salary salary continuance i've never used that one i hope i never will but that's kind of like an insurance thing i sure like that one
 	
 	
 		well
 		ah yes
 	
 	
 		that's like automobile insurance you never want to get in an accident but it you like to have it there
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		well uh
 		like i say i worked for several different <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> and there's nothing to compare with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh TI</ENAMEX> here
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		now i really got caught up back in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eighty five</NUMEX> i got caught up in the oil layoff
 		uh i wasn't with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GSI</ENAMEX> but i was connected with uh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> oil
 		uh exploration
 	
 	
 		right
 		with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> or somebody else
 	
 	
 		no with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but i say i wasn't connected with GSI
 	
 	
 		oh right yeah
 	
 	
 		and i got caught up in a layoff now
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh course you get <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six months</TIMEX>
 		uh unemployment from the state
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but what <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> did for us is is uh i i've never heard of it before
 		they fixed us up with an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> with uh telephones access to long distance
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> computers
 		a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX> to take messages for us or type uh letters for us
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh they had out of town newspapers
 		and then the company
 	
 	
 		and outside <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultants</ENAMEX> didn't they have an outside <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultant</ENAMEX> too
 	
 	
 		i beg your pardon
 	
 	
 		did they have an outside <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultant</ENAMEX> like a
 	
 	
 		uh yes they they did have uh seminars every once in a while
 	
 	
 		the employee
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh cause that was not uh restricted just to just us
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but the most important thing was that uh they had
 		made up the difference between
 		uh unemployment pay and seventy <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">five percent</NUMEX> of my net pay
 		and they then <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> paid me that
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		so uh i was able to uh not just exist i mean i i lived just as comfortably as i did before i was laid off
 	
 	
 		yeah they seem to be doing doing a good job of that i'm in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> and and our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> built builds those <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> over in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Park Central</ENAMEX> now
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i guess they've been using them for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six months</TIMEX> now and i've known several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineers</ENAMEX> that got laid off and they said
 		it's like getting a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">PhD</ENAMEX> almost they the much they learn over there you know after they've been laid off uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineer</ENAMEX> said it was really an education he he just learned like you he said
 		he learned a tremendous amount that he never would have able to pick up on his own he was very thankful for that too
 	
 	
 		well this was not a learning thing by any means it was just a uh
 		uh an assistance trying to find another job
 	
 	
 		to have an office yeah
 		yeah well he said he learned so much and how he thought he thought he had a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PhD</ENAMEX> in how to get a job after he was through the whole process for for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several months</TIMEX> he did eventually get a job
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 		well course i went through this uh what about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five years ago</TIMEX> they may have improved it considerably
 	
 	
 		yeah apparently it's very sophisticated and i guess it may be one of the best uh that anyone's doing
 	
 	
 		well that's one of those little uh
 		uh little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">extras</ENAMEX> that you don't see in the uh the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the the handbook</TIMEX> you know
 	
 	
 		right you're absolutely right that's a good one
 	
 	
 		it
 	
 	
 		what do you think about pensions anything on that or
 	
 	
 		well now i have uh uh i'm getting close to retirement
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and of course i've been looking into it but uh
 		since i'm only a yellow badger i won't be getting a whole heck of a lot from <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> as far as retirement is concerned
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		right
 		what do you think of a pension that goes from one <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> to the other like an account like a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">401K</NUMEX> account i i've been thinking about that for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> uh
 	
 	
 		i've never heard of such a thing
 	
 	
 		i know that's what i'm saying that that pensions you see just like you were you're saying you've only got uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">so many years</TIMEX> say you work for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> if you take your pension with you after you're vested
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and then just add the money together like you do with a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">401K</NUMEX> account you know
 	
 	
 		uh yeah
 	
 	
 		uh it's your account period it doesn't matter where you go or anything that's your account to roll over
 	
 	
 		i that that sounds like a hell of an idea i didn't know there was such a thing
 	
 	
 		no no there isn't i i'm saying that's the question what do you think could be better and i'm saying that pensions say in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two thousand</NUMEX> or more when social security goes away which it probably will
 		i think they ought to have a pension at least that you'd never lose you work for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven years</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		yes by all means well what would be the difference between that and social security
 	
 	
 		uh well social security's going to go to way i think and you can or you can invest your own money you have no control over your social security and it's not paid for by the current
 		like when say we retire after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two thousand</NUMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">social security</ENAMEX>'s paid for by the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty five year olds</TIMEX> you know they may rebel
 		and you won't have any social security where if your money was in your account i mean you can never lose it it's there you don't have to depend on anybody to be putting that money in for you you know
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		that's just a thought i mean i
 	
 	
 		uh-huh no i i like the idea course that's that's some something like an IRA
 	
 	
 		if they say which
 		yeah
 		yeah and instead of having a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a socialized</NUMEX> pension it just would be really money that you and your <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> maybe you had to put some money in it too i don't really know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but i i can see where they'd need to do something on that because
 		the statistics are you don't work for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty years</TIMEX> through no fault of your own you know
 		you work for <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">five six seven</NUMEX> and you you a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> i know guys
 	
 	
 		yeah that that's what i've done i i've bounced around about every <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten years</TIMEX> i change
 	
 	
 		yeah i have too but not not quite that often but uh yeah i've only got uh
 		i've got <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fourteen now</TIMEX> here at <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> and i hope to make <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty five</TIMEX> but say if something happened to me i mean
 		you know they lay me off uh you have a pension but then you'd have to try to get a pension in another one it would be nice if they could get them together
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i do worry about medical though again knock <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wood</ENAMEX> that uh
 		i haven't used it i guess you i'm sorry you really do use it throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> because you get your teeth fixed and all that i mean i but i'm not i'm talking about major items i haven't used it for anything major
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i'm glad it's there though
 	
 	
 		well knock wood i haven't used mine anything for anything major just <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> visits and
 		well i i have the uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Homa</ENAMEX> i use <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Homa</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i like that uh a lot better than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aetna</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i have the regular i again i just i haven't i can't complain about it because i haven't used it and every time i needed it it it  it's uh you know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		fallen right in line for the the minor things i guess i'm the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> just supporting most of the others
 	
 	
 		well doesn't it work you don't see uh uh anything until you spend the minimum
 		don't you have to spend the minimum of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two three hundred</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh yeah yeah i think it's <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">two seventy five</NUMEX> for a family but the dental is right away if you exams uh
 	
 	
 		yeah well now i have the same dental you have
 	
 	
 		okay yeah the medical you have to have a deductible
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh</ENAMEX> now see i don't have a deductible
 	
 	
 		yeah right
 	
 	
 		i pay a straight <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">five dollars</NUMEX> for anything a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> visit or drugs
 	
 	
 		well <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> are okay now i'm on that uh
 		plan where i take blood pressure <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX> if you take an allergy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX> so anything you need a prescription for for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than six months</TIMEX> you get it for used to be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> bucks they just raised it to twelve
 	
 	
 		oh that one i haven't heard about
 	
 	
 		yeah that's a typical that's a typical one that's in there
 		the forms are right in personnel
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		fact you may be able to take care of take advantage of that it's through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baxter Labs</ENAMEX>
 		uh
 	
 	
 		yeah i have high blood pressure problems myself
 	
 	
 		well maybe you still can do that do you do you buy your pills one at a time
 	
 	
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every thirty days</TIMEX> at a time
 	
 	
 		well turn turn in your forms go right to personnel i don't know whether you have to about an HMO i don't think so
 		you turn you get your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> to give you a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than six months</TIMEX> prescription
 		and uh they're twelve dollars again they just were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> they just raised them to twelve this year
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twelve</NUMEX> dollars for a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three months</TIMEX> supply
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		or whatever whatever the the amount is uh i don't want to say <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three months</TIMEX> but
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it's a lot cheaper allergy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX>'s really uh expensive and that blood pressure <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX> is fairly expensive i take two
 		go right to personnel they got the forms in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> and maybe i maybe i've told you go something you didn't know about in benefits there
 	
 	
 		um
 		yeah
 		yeah i just might do that
 	
 	
 		i do it yeah i you know it's a very common thing
 		it's through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baxter Labs</ENAMEX> tell yeah
 	
 	
 		well thanks thanks for the tip <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jim i i</ENAMEX> shall look into it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		what else i'm sure we're getting close to our <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five minutes</TIMEX> whatever here
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh let's see we discussed uh uh medical and dental
 	
 	
 		what other benefits
 	
 	
 		uh retirement
 	
 	
 		yeah the salary continuation i think that's a great one but again a hope i never use that one that means you're really sick if you have to use that one
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		what about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">vacation</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		i'm satisfied with the vacation i don't know what else you know you nice to say you get another week
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		and when i'm well i only got <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fourteen years</TIMEX> so i'll get another week when i hit fifteen
 	
 	
 		uh yeah that's right
 	
 	
 		so that's that's fair i mean it's reasonable if <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four weeks</TIMEX> is a lot i think
 		i know some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who have <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty five years</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> and they want more but uh you know
