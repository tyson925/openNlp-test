 
     		
 	
 		all right i guess our i we're in the process of a home repair right at this point because we're we're painting the outside of our house
 		i don't know i guess that's you would consider that a home repair certainly uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> and interesting enough this time we're changing the color which makes uh an addition uh we've  what does your most recent
 	
 	
 		oh we just barely did that too
 	
 	
 		you did that recently too huh make does it make a big difference
 	
 	
 		yes
 		oh yes we have brick on the outside and uh it the colors that were there changed the and the colors we painted changed the entire look of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX> completely
 	
 	
 		that's neat isn't it nah
 	
 	
 		yes it was really exciting it was fun
 	
 	
 		i was really uh really tired of the color and it's it's it's helping we're not quite through but it's it really is looking good
 		uh we went through a process of of uh home repairs on a on a rental <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> we had probably the most uh extensive and uh the interesting part of it was how much we learned about what we could do
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">um</ENAMEX> didn't have very much money and so we had to to do it ourselves in a kind of a slow process but we learned how to do
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> retile bathtubs and and um
 		oh just all kinds of things that are kind of unusual
 	
 	
 		um-hum well the other thing that we did was the roof of our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and uh we did that a different color also of course uh
 	
 	
 		ah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		being a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> most of these things were done by uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and uh so i wasn't directly involved but uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		they really were helpful i know to our house
 	
 	
 		it's nice to not have a drip through from the ceiling from the roof isn't it
 	
 	
 		yes yes
 	
 	
 		that's awful um uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howard</ENAMEX> and i were talking about home repair <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the other night</TIMEX> in uh in connection with Scouting you got a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scouter</ENAMEX> uh coming up and uh
 		uh i think it's neat for for young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to learn how to uh take care of their
 		of of a household you know like uh fixing faucets and drippy faucets and putting in panes of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glass</ENAMEX> and stuff like that
 	
 	
 		that's right
 		well as a matter of fact one thing uh i have a young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> and one thing we did was we had paneling on the inside of our uh front of our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hallway</ENAMEX> of our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> rather
 		and we were repainting the the front <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX> there and we took down that paneling and he helped me and and uh he was it it was fun to work with him
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh and help putty up the holes together and and do things like that he was a
 	
 	
 		
 
 		how did the how did the paneling paneling looks lots better do you do you like it better
 	
 	
 		oh i like it so much better it makes it so much lighter you know it really um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		you know and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who have been to my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> before and and then now really have liked it much much better too so it's been fun
 	
 	
 		yeah that's nice isn't it
 		nice to have it come out to uh uh positive and look look good
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah exactly
 	
 	
 		yeah well we have a lot that needs to be done we have uh we have uh carpeting and and uh we did have a a new uh floor put in our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen</ENAMEX> and um
 		i have my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> living with us and so she was in a
 		a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> with a carpet and course she's quite aged she's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ninety three</NUMEX> now so that meant she had problems <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">now and then</TIMEX> and it it was really good to get the carpet out of there and put a a linoleum down so it was easier to clean and
 		see where the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dirt</ENAMEX> was and  so that was a really positive uh uh
 		it was fairly expensive though i'm i was impressed i think that uh we we had somebody do it and and it was
 		it seems to me like it's probably more expensive to put down linoleum almost than it is to put down carpet
 	
 	
 		hm that's interesting
 	
 	
 		kind of depends on the on the quality of carpet i suppose but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh in in the case of the linoleum they have to rip up everything and and fix the floor so it's
 		uh i don't know whatever but they have to put stuff on the floor and it's uh kind of a process so
 	
 	
 		oh i bet it does
 	
 	
 		well it sounds like you've had some pretty good experiences with uh with uh um home repair
 	
 	
 		uh-huh we have it's been really fun
 	
 	
 		yeah all right happy home repairing okay bye-bye
 	
 	
 		well okay you too bye-bye
