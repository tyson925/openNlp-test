 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh not to say i wouldn't eventually i mean what was the last book you read
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> jeez let me think it i tell you i haven't read a book in a long time
 		and it i can't even really remember uh i think it was a romantic novel by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Danielle Steel</ENAMEX> or one of those you know yeah  honestly um i don't do as much reading like i say as i would like to
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		really
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		we've been working a lot of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> at work and
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		yeah and then of course we have a home so it's
 	
 	
 		i know
 	
 	
 		you know a lot time is spent doing things as far as the yard work or housework or you know that type of thing
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i set i set a goal for myself to read a book a month <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> which is
 		like <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about eleven</NUMEX> more books than i would have read <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> but so far i've only read like <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> books and so i'm not doing very well but
 	
 	
 		but see i do crafts too so it's hard i if i have a minute that's what i do i do
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i find it's real hard i let <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers newspapers</ENAMEX> stack up and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazines</ENAMEX> stack up if i don't really set aside a time to look or or read them
 	
 	
 		and
 		that's the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">and</ENAMEX> and that's like myself i've i've i've miss it because i really find it a very relaxing hobby too
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i really do and um
 		i don't know it seems like you can get lost in a book you know it it it's like an escape for me i don't know about you
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		it's if i'm really interested in what i'm reading i mean <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> can go by and i i look up at the clock and say oh my word you know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		in fact i'd rather read sometimes than watch TV
 	
 	
 		yeah oh i would too
 		um
 	
 	
 		but i think you get out of the habit like you say you have to like kind of set yourself
 	
 	
 		kind of train your mind
 	
 	
 		yep
 	
 	
 		have you ever read uh or heard of the book <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">This Present Darkness</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		that was one of the books i read <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> and it's really fast <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">paced</ENAMEX> and intense
 		it was a nonfiction book or is a fiction book but it was a real it was one of the best i've read i mean it was it was real good and it was um
 		it was one of the few books that like it you know just hurry up and go through without putting down you know
 	
 	
 		yeah right  see that's the other problem i have if i start into something and i really enjoy what i'm reading
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		then i have a terrible time getting away from it too i'll stay up until <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two or three o'clock in the morning</TIMEX>
 		you know because i'm so engrossed in it and then before you know it it's time to get up and go to work you know that type of thing
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that's why i i don't know i'm i'm kind of a nut when it comes to stuff like that even if i'm uh doing something like an afghan if i'm close to the end sometimes i'll do the same thing
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i don't know what you would call it maybe i have a problem
 	
 	
 		no i'm sure it's
 	
 	
 		it's terrible i i really like books that that you can get into and that's sense
 	
 	
 		fast  or something
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		i know what you mean
 		i like reading <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">late at night</TIMEX> right before i go to bed sometimes i just sleep better or something
 	
 	
 		oh yeah you do you kind of get relaxed that's true
 	
 	
 		but uh
 	
 	
 		i have a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">craft</ENAMEX> books that i have too and uh magazines i like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> you know those things that are about real people

 		just from hail
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		i think <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Farm</ENAMEX> went bankrupt just about
 	
 	
 		oh jeez
 		i know the whole situation is bad
 	
 	
 		but uh
 	
 	
 		up here we're having a terrible time with the recession
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah it's not good at all
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		i know things are pretty booming down there
 		i heard they sold <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Johnson City</ENAMEX> though
 	
 	
 		yeah and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colorado Springs</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 		and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colorado Springs</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah i talked to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> on the phone on this <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the other day</TIMEX> and he was telling me about it
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		they just sold it
 	
 	
 		amazing
 	
 	
 		closed up and moved down to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McKinney</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh well that's good at least they kept the business part of it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's scary though i'm telling you
 	
 	
 		i know
 	
 	
 		i don't know and well you know with the other part of this thing was how do you feel that this influences family
 	
 	
 		how do i feel what
 	
 	
 		that that books influence do you know how to use them in your life or to influence
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i i feel like it's important for young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> to read too and what you read to them
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		when my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> were were younger of course they were all married and grown and i have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandchildren</ENAMEX> now they were uh i i read to them a lot
 	
 	
 		that's good
 	
 	
 		and uh i think they've all developed kind of an interest in reading also i'm not saying they read all the right things but they do read uh where a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> don't have any interest in it at all and i think it's important
 	
 	
 		that's real yeah
 		
 
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		because uh even <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are so illiterate and they go off to school and really nothing happens i mean they don't learn anything it's because they can't read
 	
 	
 		yeah it's really surprising how many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people graduate</ENAMEX> from high school and that i work with and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> i mean i get memos all the time across my desk and things are misspelled and it's really
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh it's so unbelievable isn't it
 	
 	
 		it's pretty sad a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that work for me that can't even spell or read you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		exactly and i think that that's why reading is so important
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		because uh i think even mentally when you can do some
