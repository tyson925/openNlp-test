 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well what what kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> did you just buy a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> or are you in the market to buy a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> or
 	
 	
 		actually i'm real close to being in the market to buy a car i've got uh a couple older <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> they're both over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten years old</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh they've served me well
 		but i kind of would like to get a more uh gas efficient <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> and a newer model something looks a little nicer
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh i've got <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> at home <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two  fourteen year olds</TIMEX> and a twelve year old
 		and so i need to make sure i've got <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> that i can fit
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> of us into and if you if you know anything about <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teenagers</ENAMEX> it's kind of hard to get them to sit together for any amount of time
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah i i seem to remember when i was young that was a problem
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but no no <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> was big enough for that
 	
 	
 		well uh i've kind of been leaning towards a Caravan
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> now i know that that uh they've gotten quite pricey in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last couple of years</TIMEX>
 		but uh i like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dodge</ENAMEX> products
 		and uh been uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">couple</NUMEX> times i've had a opportunity to rent one
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh i've been really pleased with its performance and with the size
 		and because if you get the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> passenger version  you can put some space between the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 		and uh i think that would that would serve us well plus it's got uh good storage capacity in it for you know taking things along going to the store
 	
 	
 		um-hum which is the one that has modular type seats you know which one i'm talking about they have the commercial on TV where you can you can pull some seats out and you can move around
 	
 	
 		um-hum exactly correct
 		yeah if you want
 	
 	
 		is that is that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dodge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Caravan</ENAMEX> that does that or
 	
 	
 		yes
 		yeah it uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dodge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Caravans</ENAMEX> will do that
 		uh you can take the uh uh usually there's a uh a double seat behind the uh front buckets
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and then if you get the and then there's a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> seat that goes or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> seat that goes in the back now what you can do is you could take that middle seat out
 		and just have the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> seats in the back and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> seats up front or you can take the uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> seat out and just use the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> seat or you can take the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> seat and move the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> seat to the back
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so it's very versatile you can move the seats all around that's the only thing you can't do is take that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> across seat and move it forward
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		well the one that i can't remember one it is but it's the
 		if it's the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toyota</ENAMEX> or
 		or one of the other ones i don't know if it's one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> or the import ones where uh they actually have like um
 		some bucket seats in the back but you can actually pull them out i mean they're really easy to pull out
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">um</ENAMEX> and you can uh move them around and stuff and it it to me
 		that that would be real good for us uh my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> and i uh like to go camping and stuff and right now we have a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">van</ENAMEX> which is it's an older <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">van</ENAMEX> and we're we're thinking about buying another <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">sedan</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um probably next year
 		um right now <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">motorcycles</ENAMEX> is takes precedence since that that's what my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> really wants right now
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</TIMEX> we'll probably buy a new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> and we're looking at uh possibly the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Honda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Accord</ENAMEX>
 		um
 		that's kind of uh
 		as far as far as the interior it's got the luxury interior but doesn't it doesn't really have the luxury price tag that a lot of the other <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> have
 		which is one of the things that we were looking at you know finding something that's that's fairly affordable but yet has all the nice luxury items that we want
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah i think that's getting to be kind of important now that uh you know the price is becoming
 		the driving factor and then you look at once you realize how much money you've got to spend then you start looking around at at what you can buy with it where before i think you
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you looked at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> you wanted and then you looked to see how well you could afford it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 		or how you could afford it
 	
 	
 		yeah well i think it's going to be a lot easier now i just heard that they  lowered the prime lending rate
 		so i think it's going to be a lot easier to to be able to get a car now and finance it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i think <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX> are going to be a lot more a little bit more lenient
 	
 	
 		yeah i know they're trying to do everything they can to uh end the recession
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and dropping the prime is probably one of the things i just bought a new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> so
 		i got a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a uh nine and a half</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">percent</NUMEX> interest rate
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		not sure i could do much better today
 		but uh that is also effecting buying a new car
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah i can imagine you got to kind of work work that into your budget that balance that and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> payment and of course uh is if you buy a new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> you're going to are any of your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> driving age yet
 	
 	
 		well that and there
 		uh <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fourteen year olds</TIMEX> will be uh fifteen on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fourth of July</TIMEX>
 		so
 	
 	
 		are so are they twins
 	
 	
 		yeah they're <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">twins</ENAMEX> born on the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">bicentennial</TIMEX>
 		you're going to have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">twins</ENAMEX> have them on the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">bicentennial</TIMEX> is our motto <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July fourth seventy six</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so uh uh i've still got another <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">full year</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three months</TIMEX> before they're going to be
 		behind the wheel of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> so <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>'s safe for another fifteen month
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh after that
 		now i may keep the uh one or both of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> i i currently have for them to drive you know they're they're
 		they're small enough that a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">driver</ENAMEX> could handle it yet big enough that i feel safe feel safe that if they were in an accident they would survive
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know what i mean it i don't get that kind of feeling with the kind of car like you talked about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Honda</ENAMEX>
 		they're just
 	
 	
 		well the the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Honda</ENAMEX>'s have been have been very safe in in accidents uh more so than a lot of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> as a matter of fact i just heard something <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> on on the news about
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		is that right
 	
 	
 		those uh automatic seat belts that are attached to the door um they're questioning the safety of those now
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		right
 	
 	
 		saying that and they showed uh a simulation where there were they had a dummy in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> and the door opened and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dummy</ENAMEX> actually fell out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> rolled out on top of him
 	
 	
 		jeez
 	
 	
 		so they're saying they're not as safe as they give the appearance of being safe but they're really not as safe as they as they uh appear to be
 		so um
 		i'm kind of concerned about that as far as you know what the seat belts
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		uh i don't know if <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Marylan d</ENAMEX> has a uh a seat belt law but they do have one in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> and you're you're required to wear them
 	
 	
 		yes definitely
 		the thing is that they're i think it's a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> part seat belt though there's the uh door belt and then there's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> a lap belt
 	
 	
 		exactly but
 		ninety uh probably about well i don't know about <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ninety</NUMEX> but probably fifty percent of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that have those probably don't wear the lap portion of it
 		i know my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> doesn 't and he has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> in his car
 	
 	
 		then make sure you smack him around then
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so i mean it it kind of gives you a false sense of security you think oh i've got <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> portion of my seat belt on
 		um but if your door comes open
 		you know it's not going to do you any good
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so that that that's a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> of mine as far as uh what i'll be looking at with with buying a new car um
 		i'm not really sure if i would want the seat belts attached to the door i think i would feel better with them attached to the actual car the inside where they're normally attached to like behind the door
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah the uh the supports
 		um a good source of information i've found has always been these uh used <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> manuals
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		because you can flip through the used <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> manuals and they'll give you a list of all the problems that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>'s had in the past
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		and you can look at the uh the track record on a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> and you usually notice uh a lot of problems at the beginning and then things kind of iron out to where there's fewer problems and you get an idea on how well
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		the the next <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>'s going to be now as long as they aren't changing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> you know like when the uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pontiac</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Grand Prix</ENAMEX> went from being a huge <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> to a small <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> they had a lot of problems with the smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> as long as they aren't
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah the the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Le Mans</ENAMEX> is like that too uh we used to have a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Le Mans</ENAMEX> when i was in in high school
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">um</ENAMEX> and it was a big car i mean it was like the uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Grand Prix</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and in i think around nineteen eighty um
 		they changed the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> and it like went went to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> the size
 	
 	
 		yeah sure
 	
 	
 		literally i mean it got chopped in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> and it wasn't even the same car anymore didn't even remotely resemble the old car
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah i remember when that happened so unless they're really changing the model
 		um
 		yeah chances are that it's probably going to have the the fewer mistakes than it had <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> before
 	
 	
 		yeah well everybody that i've talked to who's ever had a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Honda</ENAMEX> loves them and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> had a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Honda</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> and it was a lease <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> and he had to turn back in uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year and a half</TIMEX> ago
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> and he had it for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four years</TIMEX> and never had a single problem with it and it was great
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">um</ENAMEX> and the only reason why we ended up not buying it was because
 		we didn't feel the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at</TIMEX> at the time the residual was like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixty</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">five hundred dollars</NUMEX> and it was a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four year old</TIMEX> car with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">seventy thousand miles</NUMEX> on it and we thought that was a little bit too much to pay for
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four year old</TIMEX> car
 	
 	
 		yeah i agree
 	
 	
 		so
 		so we ended up just went just went ahead and just turned the keys back in and and got out of the lease
 		um
 		one thing that i that i am curious about is um reading information on air bags do some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vans</ENAMEX> i think i don't know about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dodge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Caravan</ENAMEX> but some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vans</ENAMEX> now now have um <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">driver</ENAMEX> side air bags
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		which i think is a good idea
 	
 	
 		yeah
