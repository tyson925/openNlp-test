 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> bedroom <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> bath and uh i it's it i don't know i got <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> numbers <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> actually we were talking about mortgage insurance <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> with my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> and uh it's <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about sixteen hundred square feet</NUMEX> which is fine for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of us
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		right
 	
 	
 		but it it you know we looked at a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> that were had more square footage but they didn't use it right you know it was a bunch of empty
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		right
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hallway</ENAMEX> and stuff that  yeah yeah really so we've used every bit of it and our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> um
 	
 	
 		that could have been used as yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		we bought it for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixty four</TIMEX> and uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">neighbors house</ENAMEX> next door to us sold for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">seventy five</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		um
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so i you know i think we were  you know got a good deal on it considering yeah yeah yeah well
 	
 	
 		yeah so that looks good when you all get ready to sell you'll probably do really well my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> used to live in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> uh now he he went back to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Jersey</ENAMEX> we're originally from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East</ENAMEX> but he
 	
 	
 		oh really my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>'s from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Jersey</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh really  he uh well actually right now he lives in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rhode Island</ENAMEX> he
 		lived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Jersey</ENAMEX> for a while now he's in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rhode Island</ENAMEX> and um he used to like to go and we used to go just <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every weekend</TIMEX> just to look at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> for no reason we weren't buying <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every weekend</TIMEX> but just to look at them
 		and so i got a pretty good feel of you know what i want when i do you know get my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> whenever that is um
 		what was i going to say about that  i completely lost my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX> of thought um but we we enjoy going looking at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> and and um we now i kind of have a good idea of what i want i know i want a big <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> area um
 	
 	
 		yeah that's what we were looking for the first thing
 	
 	
 		yeah fire a fireplace i saw this awesome <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the other weekend</TIMEX> it was a great big family <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> and it was circular and the other side was the patio and the backyard
 		and it had a built in uh grill and every i mean it was it was just an ultimate the ultimate party room you know i was but that's pretty nice
 	
 	
 		wow um-hum yeah
 		but that's what we had uh uh that's what we had looked for was our main <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> was a big living room you know and big <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">closet space</ENAMEX> you know i said
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		right yeah i like a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">closet space</ENAMEX> i don't like because i don't like to have a lot of things out you know just all over the place i like to have them kind of tucked away
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		and uh so that's that's what we went for <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> and and it you know we we don't we just have a big living room an and a dining <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> is separate
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and you know some places have like the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> next door to us that we looked at had a living room a dining <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> and a den but to stick a wall between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		right
 	
 	
 		didn't do anything for us just so we could have a living room and a den so we opted for the just the whole wide <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> that went from one end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> to the other just about
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> had uh i keep talking about my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> because he owned a house um
 		he had the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen</ENAMEX> kind of a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen</ENAMEX> and a very long family <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> it's just kind of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> and what he did he put uh a bar right in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> and put some um a glass rack
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		down so you had like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> glasses hanging from the ceiling and then the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX> and it just kind of it kind of separated it it was still you know together but it just looked a lot better
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		because i personally don't like the combination
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> so
 	
 	
 		right i but i i think for where we are um i think we got a real good deal on it and we you know we have a uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		the backyard is just huge it is just really i think another <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> could fit back there
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah i'd like a big backyard
 	
 	
 		and uh we really liked it of course when you have to mow it  you know in uh middle of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August</TIMEX> it's it's kind of a little hot yeah but uh it's it's nice and that was
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		yeah a little hot try to do it <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early in the mornings</TIMEX>
 		um
 	
 	
 		you know a big selling point too and i think another thing that was really nice was that our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> on the other side of us bought the lot right next to us
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and they've lived there and have it all built up you know they've got a whole garden and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> and everything so it's not like we're uh kind of secluded you know we don't have a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">fence</ENAMEX> coming up to ours
 	
 	
 		hum
 		wow
 		
 
 		uh-huh well that's good yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		you know right up to our bathroom window or whatever it is like a lot of the little model <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> that they  you know throw up in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three days</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh</ENAMEX>  that's true they do throw those up
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		are you all planning to move anytime are you looking for a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> or not um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		no no not at all in fact uh we we talked about that just a little bit you know we were joking around about uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		winning a sweepstakes and what would we do with the money and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve</ENAMEX> said we'll i'll buy a bigger <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and i said no i would just fix this one  you know there's you know because we i like where it is and i like how it's laid out and it took us forever
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah really
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		to find it um-hum
 	
 	
 		to find it but when we found it it was we knew it yeah
 	
 	
 		you knew that was it  i'll probably i'll probably move but i'll probably move to another <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> or something because i'm i'm i'm really
 	
 	
 		yeah have you had any
 	
 	
 		um what's the word i move a lot anyway because the job i have i only work like here i'll be here for like a year and then i'll move off i can move up
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		where
 	
 	
 		and so i'm a i'm a news <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> i work at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Channel Six</ENAMEX> and so this is like my <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> job so i won't be here very long so i'm not even looking to buy anything as permanent as house
 	
 	
 		oh okay oh okay
 		right
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know so i'm staying staying in an <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> and i'm not married or anything so it's no biggie
 	
 	
 		um yeah and that's and that's one thing is once you you know you get into a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> it's like you you get more stuff
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and to put it all back into an <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> would just never work  God i can't believe we moved out of an <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> and had this much stuff and it actually fit you know of course we got it on a little bit of more furniture and stuff but
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		like i'm amazed at how much stuff i've accumulated in my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> because up to this point i was in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> and so i'd go home every <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">summer</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i could take all my stuff home because i didn't have a bed or a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couch</ENAMEX> or any any of that but now i could not move back home and i just realized this you know <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the other day</TIMEX> i'm going wait a minute i can't go back home for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX> or anything i have too much stuff so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it was just like a weird transition out of home  so i have to move in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartments</ENAMEX> just because i have so much stuff
 	
 	
 		yeah and that's actually three fifteen over there's probably not real real bad for for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Waco</ENAMEX> and and for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">as many gosh</TIMEX> as many as <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartments</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">condos</ENAMEX> are over there
 	
 	
 		no it's not it's not yeah
 		oh my goodness yeah um-hum
 	
 	
 		i mean it it's just and and especially around <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lake Shore</ENAMEX> area that area's picked up quite a bit since we were there and uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah um-hum there there are <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">tons</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartments</ENAMEX> down here i mean and it
 	
 	
 		yeah because i i had lived in the gosh i'm not sure what they're called now but they were <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lake Shore Apartments</ENAMEX> that are like right next to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">baseball field MCC Baseball</ENAMEX> field but
 	
 	
 		MCC yeah yeah i i think they're called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Lake Shore Villa</ENAMEX> or something
 	
 	
 		no the ones next door to those there were <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lake Shore</ENAMEX> there's a i don't know what they look like now
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hum</ENAMEX> and it's a nursing there was a nursing home or something like that
 	
 	
 		yeah there was a nursing home and then there's an <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> and then there's another <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> and we lived in those those <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> ones and they we moved in when they were brand new uh you know we drive by now and think gosh you know look how much it's changed an
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		um i think that uh-huh
 		yeah
 		how often do you all come through Waco
 	
 	
 		oh ever now and then um it just we
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		depends on what's going on
 	
 	
 		it's uh yeah and it's not really now that it's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixty five</TIMEX> it doesn't take hardly anytime to get there you know run to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mall</ENAMEX> or run to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam</ENAMEX>'s or
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum yeah</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		or whatever we used to run to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Red</ENAMEX> you know <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Red Lobster</ENAMEX> but now they've got <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Killeen</ENAMEX> so we don't have to run that far so that's that's about how things are and the seems like the market here's picking up yeah i really think it is
 	
 	
 		um-hum  all right
 		hum
 		you think uh-huh uh-huh
 		um
 	
 	
 		just for the fact that the
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		you know it's
 		it seemed like as soon as we bought this house
 		we saw all these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> for sale you know and i think now a lot of them are selling and a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sellers</ENAMEX> are getting close to what they want instead of you know just having to give it away
 	
 	
 		um
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Waco</ENAMEX> to me seems seems like it's pretty steady i mean i'm not a real estate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> or anything but it it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's a real college <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> and so you know you have these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartments</ENAMEX> and then the the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> are all most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> are pretty nice and i don't i don't you know really see a lot on sale or anything and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are pretty stable here
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know i kind of see this as kind of a retirement <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX>  as i always call it yeah um um-hum
 	
 	
 		yeah i i saw i see that a lot too there and it's nice too i liked living there
