 
     		
 	
 		ready to talk okay
 	
 	
 		i guess so  okay
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh i want to talk about um our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> budget and the times that it's worked and the times that it hasn't worked and give you a general description of it and you can help me out a little bit
 	
 	
 		okay
 		yeah
 		okay
 	
 	
 		tell me how yours work
 		
 
 		well at the my i introduced you a little bit to it <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a few minutes ago</TIMEX> when i said that we are uh we're on the east coast now
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> quit a perfectly wonderful job and decided that well we both decided we wanted to move to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Carolina</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and so naturally we put ourselves we looked at our budget
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and so what we did was draw up a budget that we thought uh was realistic and uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so we had to make some adjustments because we really are kind of looking for something that we want to do uh he wants to do that's satisfactory and we've been here <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven months</TIMEX> and he's still hasn't hit up on anything permanently
 	
 	
 		oh no that throws the budget out of whack real fast
 	
 	
 		so you see
 		well we actually planned for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about one year</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh good
 	
 	
 		uh thank God because it never occurred
 	
 	
 		really that was smart
 	
 	
 		it never occurred to us that it would take <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven months</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh what we did was just uh decide what how we had been spending our money before
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and then we put that on the computer and then we took <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about three months</TIMEX> and uh and adjusted where we could come down and where we didn't want to come down
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and we really uh lessened it uh our living expenses uh more than what we thought we would
 	
 	
 		wow that's great did you have a special program on your computer to do that or was this just your own design of
 	
 	
 		but
 		oh just our own design uh-huh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh</ENAMEX> gosh
 	
 	
 		and uh so but we've had budgets that didn't work when our uh you know of our <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fifteen years or eighteen years</TIMEX> of being married nothing worked
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		we spent too much money until our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids children</ENAMEX> went to college so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so tell me about do you all uh have a budget
 	
 	
 		well we've been married for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five and a half years</TIMEX> and we started out without <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> of course and found it much easier to save and used to do a lot more  fun kinds of things that uh didn't really um
 		you know have a real strict budget but budget but uh the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the about</TIMEX> into our when when when when we <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> got married we were in graduate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> and we were just you know dirt poor
 		then when we got our <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> jobs after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about a year</TIMEX> of marriage we decided we'd bank my salary so we could buy a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> so we virtually did that for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about two years</TIMEX> which worked real well
 	
 	
 		wonderful
 	
 	
 		and then moved from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> where we realized we could never buy a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX> anyway no matter how much we saved
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		and moved to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> and bought a house immediately you know which of course is now devalued with the housing market so i don't know if we  we did a good thing to buy a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> or not but at least we've got a place to live
 		um so now since uh we have a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three year old</TIMEX> and a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two year old</TIMEX> now um
 	
 	
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> and a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two year old</TIMEX> bang bang
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		that's that that threw our budget really out of out of whack too
 		and we um have been just forced to budget much more because i quit working to be home with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> and um we just really have uh
 		uh i don't know we've we've tried different times we've done like a survey of like taking you know <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past three months</TIMEX> of where all the money went
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and we really don't spend on anything much of a luxury or anything at all but it seems like there's um
 		times when we just have to get out where we'll go and like get a babysitter and we'll go and we'll blow you know fifty <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixty</TIMEX> dollars in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one night</TIMEX> going out to eat going to a show or doing something you know
 	
 	
 		well i think that's important for your budget to be realistically for it to work though you have to do something
 	
 	
 		yeah that's the hard part because when we sit down to make it we try to make it real spartan and real narrow so we can put certain amount in savings <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every week</TIMEX> and then it's not really that realistic because we do find that we want to go and do something or
 		splurge for you know birthday for somebody or you know even we we even do things real frugally for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> we get a lot of toys and clothes and stuff at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garage</ENAMEX> sales or from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> because they don't know the difference at this age you know whether they're Jordache new or whether they're
 	
 	
 		of course not
 	
 	
 		you know something and they're both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> so they just fit <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one year</TIMEX> after the other into each other's clothes so
 		but um that's the hardest part for us is that it's really um you know budgeting and some extra things you know for that are more you know nonessential items
 	
 	
 		well i found uh that in the place that it was harder for me to stick to a budget was not where we were concerned
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but where maybe our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> were concerned and our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> and parents
 		uh we we tended to want to keep on giving lavish gifts as we had done before
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i really believe that if you're going to cut down on yourself you need to cut down somewhat on your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		on your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> that's true  that's true  well we have so many unexpected things come up so often it seems with we both have older <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> and something will come up and we'll end up having to spend <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a thousand dollars</NUMEX> you know on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two months</TIMEX> or something and
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		you know a lot of things like that that really is are hard to plan for and uh
 	
 	
 		well i really do i think you have to budget those things though
 	
 	
 		yeah kind of put in a certain amount per year you're going to have on extra expenses for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		yes
 		exactly or know so much per month anyway
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh that really should be in your <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX> but if you don't spend it it should be in your bank account at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the month</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah  our biggest way of saving money is then just have all these deductions um you know isn't isn't let's see now i forget which way we do it we don't list all the deductions and then we get more money back you know at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the year</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh no no no no you don't want the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> to spend your money you want to be able
 	
 	
 		so that's not a good way of doing it
 		that's what my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> said so this <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> he changed it then of course we didn't get hardly i mean nearly as much back and it was like oh no we better find another way of saving money
 	
 	
 		well uh but i do realize that that is realistic for some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and it was for us <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many years</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many years</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> and if and if that's the only way that will it will make you save and have a little nest <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egg</ENAMEX> at the end of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> then doggone it that's what you should do
 	
 	
 		yeah because we don't miss it we really don't when it's just taking out of the paycheck and stuff so
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but we're trying to put a little money away for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> because we can envision envision the uh expenses for college already you know <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eighteen years</TIMEX> away or whatever
 	
 	
 		well i was just reading an article in uh
 		a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Carolina</ENAMEX> paper <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> today where a high school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> obtained over <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">two hundred thousand dollars</NUMEX> worth of scholarships for herself by sitting up at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> and typing at uh
 		letters of applications to universities
 	
 	
 		gosh
 	
 	
 		she was oh she was <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> out of a class of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two hundred and</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty</TIMEX> so it can be done
 	
 	
 		i guess that's fantastic
 	
 	
 		where there's a will where there's a will there's a way right
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well i have enjoyed talking to you
 	
 	
 		well i enjoyed talking to you too good luck and don't spend any money <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this weekend</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh i know uh we'll have to stay home and mow the yard
 	
 	
 		oh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX>  bye
 	
 	
 		bye-bye
