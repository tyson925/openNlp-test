 
     		
 	
 		okay
 		so what is your latest home repair
 	
 	
 		well uh we have done some minor repairs we're getting the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> ready to sell
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and but i mean i really minor kinds of things you know like painting the painting the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the smudge</TIMEX> marks and uh uh
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		gosh we haven't done anything uh real major
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">um</ENAMEX> did some gardening did some landscaping i don't know that that counts as home repair
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		any kind of upgrade
 	
 	
 		i would guess so i think the last thing we really did was was uh we had some gutters put up um
 		and uh that made a big difference in terms of i mean the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> was coming off the roof and just destroying the lawn
 		i we moved here from uh from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New England</ENAMEX> about uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three years ago</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh we weren't quite prepared for the kinds of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rains</ENAMEX> that uh you can get down here and uh
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		but the gutter the the uh gutters made a big difference
 		how about you
 	
 	
 		and your <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX> didn't have it on there before
 	
 	
 		no it well we bought the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> new and uh it was kind of the you know you get what you pay for
 		
 
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh we didn't invest in the gutters at the time
 	
 	
 		huh
 		i figures that was something they put on all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> i don't know
 	
 	
 		no no
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		definitely not in fact we still don't have them in the back yard yeah
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		you kind of have to dig a trench right
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		yeah i remember i've i've
 		i just got married so i've only lived in an <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">duplex</ENAMEX> so i've you know
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		have not owned a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> yet
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but i remember my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> built their home and
 		they had to they had a lot of lot of work in fact it was fifteen <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX> and they're still uh
 		trying to finish the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">basement</ENAMEX> and up you know it's a never ending process
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i don't think you
 		yeah that's it i don't think you ever you're ever completely done
 		um i know we had there's a lot of things we would have done if we'd stayed here uh we could use a shed out in the back
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh need to build could use the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> could use some shelves in their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> um
 		but i don't think you know being a new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> we wouldn't do any kind of major remodeling like redoing the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen</ENAMEX> or anything like that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh maybe in the new maybe in the new house
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		the next house uh
 	
 	
 		where are you moving to
 	
 	
 		well we're we're going to stay in the area uh and uh
 		uh we just it it turns out that this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> was much bigger and more expensive than than we wanted to to invest in
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh so we decided that uh instead of throwing all our money money into the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> we'd uh we'd try to invest it a little better and uh that way uh uh
 		uh you know it's it's it's just doesn't make sense to be house <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poor</ENAMEX> in these economic times you know what i mean
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and it's a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">buyer</ENAMEX>'s market now right
 	
 	
 		it seems to be yeah it seems to be um
 		the interest rates just went down i don't know i would imagine that's going to encourage more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to uh to look to buy a house
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um
 		so uh
 		well see
 	
 	
 		have you ever bought an old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> or rented an old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and then fixed it up
 	
 	
 		i never had uh my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> did that they uh my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>'s from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Hampshire</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and they bought this big old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">farm house</ENAMEX>
 		which you know didn't even have indoor plumbing kind of thing
 		and uh they converted the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">barn</ENAMEX> into a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garage</ENAMEX> and built a couple of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> above the barn
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		and uh they did a lot of remodeling in that <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and of course had plumbing put in
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and in fact our our <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> apartment well our <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> was what they did was they took a corner of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and converted it into an apartment
 		and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandfather</ENAMEX> is just really handy with uh tools and and and as a handyman kind of thing In fact he built his own <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> from scratch
 	
 	
 		oh cool
 	
 	
 		and and the funny thing about it is you you know you ask him well where did you learn to do that and he says well i read it in a book
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		and so course course
 		at the time that he lived that's when all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> used to pitch in and help with that kind of thing and so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		wish it was that way now don't you
 	
 	
 		i do too boy
 	
 	
 		everybody could build each other's <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> for dirt
 	
 	
 		right yeah that would be uh and and he had it was a really nice <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> he did a really nice job but he he built an <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> for us
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		built the whole <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen</ENAMEX> and the whole thing i mean we had a a whole whole uh uh
 		self-contained <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> so uh and it was nice nice
 		i'm going to sneeze in a second  i'm going wonder how they're going to uh record that um
 	
 	
 		okay
 		
 
 	
 	
 		they uh
 	
 	
 		i've been sneezing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all day</TIMEX> so
 	
 	
 		have you it's uh pollen season i guess
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh what he did was this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> is so big that now that he's retired and everything what they do is they have a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX>
 		and he completed and they in the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Summer</ENAMEX> when it's just too hot to stay in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> they go up to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Hampshire</ENAMEX> and he built himself an <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> in another corner of the house
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		and he and his uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> stay up there and then in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the winter</TIMEX> they go back to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> and they live in a little trailer <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh</ENAMEX> that's always nice to have
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		to know somebody like that
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		that can that's handy
 	
 	
 		yeah of course he's he built the shelves in the in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garage</ENAMEX> for me
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you ought to have him come down for a visit when you get your new house
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i'm sure he'd i'm sure he'd love to uh he he's getting a little impatient now because
 		i guess he's uh in his early eighties now and uh he's still you know very active and uh but you know the hand's just not as steady as it used to be
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and drawing those lines they just don't seem to come out as straight as they used to and it frustrates him
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		i mean this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> i mean i used to think it was amazing when he was in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">his sixties</TIMEX> and seventies he used to climb out on the roof and do stuff and and uh i think if you didn't stop him he'd still do it today
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		oh i'm looking forward to owning a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> or
 		getting a a small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX> that meets our needs and then fixing it up
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah it's a lot of fun um our <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> uh a real small house
 		and uh i i did you know a lot of little things there i put put up my own gutters there and uh
 		the uh being that it was in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New England</ENAMEX> uh it was one of these little <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> that was all electric
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		and uh and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Hampshire</ENAMEX> at the time had the highest utility costs in the country
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		so I was I mean we were just paying incredible bills during the long cold Winters
 		so i had a uh wood stove put in big old wood stove put in in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">basement</ENAMEX> and i built and i uh put in uh registers in the floors and stuff
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and it was a small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> so that wood stove heated up the whole <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		yeah my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> have one of those they do and they get really hot
 	
 	
 		oh yeah and uh the nice thing about up there is you know you could buy the wood pretty cheap
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		in fact what you did was during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the spring</TIMEX> you'd order the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wood</ENAMEX> when it was green and then by wintertime it had dried out and you could use it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and you could get it really cheap when it was green
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		so that was the trick where where where do you live
 	
 	
 		i live in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sherman</ENAMEX> now i'm from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indiana</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		so i've lived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sherman</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three years</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		work for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		like i said i'm looking forward to  maybe buying a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> while the interest rate's still cheap and fixing it up
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah that i think that that's always fun and and you know you can save a lot of money if you buy buy one of these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> that need some fixing up so long as it doesn't have foundation problems
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh you can do a lot of nice stuff
 	
 	
 		seems to be a lot of that
 	
 	
 		you can uh i mean it can really be your <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> because you've put your touch on it you know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		if that's that's that was the nice thing about having a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> built
 		was that you got to pick you know the the floor plan and you got to pick the color of the carpet and and all this kind of stuff
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh yeah that's fun
 		how long did you say you've been married
 	
 	
 		uh not even a year yet
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		oh those were <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the days</TIMEX> i've got <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> now
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		and they're getting to the point that's that's that's fun too you know talk about fixing up they're getting to the point where they're old enough to start pitching in
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh and helping with that kind of stuff
 	
 	
 		my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> just got done fixing the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> up again because for
