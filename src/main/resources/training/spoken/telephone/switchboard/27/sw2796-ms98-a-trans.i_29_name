 
     		
 	
 		well i currently don't have a pet although uh i have in the past
 	
 	
 		oh
 		you don't have one
 	
 	
 		not right now we
 	
 	
 		i have a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> both
 	
 	
 		oh my gosh well you should have a lot to talk about then
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh well no the place i live in is a little too small right now for uh for a pet i hate to hate to keep a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> or something like that and not have enough room for it to run around in so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh i guess you don't have that problem at least with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		no i have
 		i have a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> that uh has a a fairly good sized yard and
 		uh i also i'm here
 		by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">at night</TIMEX> by myself because my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> works at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so i i wanted a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> for protection and we
 	
 	
 		i can imagine
 	
 	
 		and we got a Dalmatian
 	
 	
 		that's a pretty big dog
 	
 	
 		yeah and he
 	
 	
 		that's a pretty dog though
 	
 	
 		he's wonderful because uh
 		he's really protective
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh that was probably our main reason for getting him but
 	
 	
 		how's how's he like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> or how's the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> like the dog i guess it
 	
 	
 		oh he loves the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat the dog</ENAMEX> uh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam</ENAMEX> our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dalmatian</ENAMEX> loves the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> just really doesn't care about the dog at all
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know he'll slap at him and
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hiss</ENAMEX> at him and everything and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> stays in
 		all the time  so
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		that's a uh you know barrier there but yeah
 	
 	
 		i guess it's a good reason to to have a pet then as protection i guess is one thing
 	
 	
 		hm yeah it is
 	
 	
 		but uh i guess i they're a lot of company though yeah friendship they're an awful lot of company
 	
 	
 		friendship yeah
 		yeah oh <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam</ENAMEX> is very loving if
 		if one of us are out in the yard you know he wants to jump and play and lick a
 		typical <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">puppy</ENAMEX> type atmosphere although he's
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		almost <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years old</TIMEX> but
 	
 	
 		oh gee
 	
 	
 		um
 		yeah the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> is a lot of companionship
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		he just he's real old and he kind of lays around just wants you pet him and and that kind of thing
 	
 	
 		doesn't doesn't get too excited about anything
 	
 	
 		no not at all not at all
 	
 	
 		he's not one of those <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> that like to sit on top of the television is he
 	
 	
 		no  my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mom</ENAMEX> has a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> though that does that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and that's kind of weird we haven't figured that out yet
 	
 	
 		yeah i've i've noticed how they get black <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> it seems like they always wanna sit on top of the television set and let their tail only when when there's something you really want to see then they let their tail down in front of the TV set in front of the screen and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		they they just seem to know i guess
 	
 	
 		just intuition or something instinct in a way
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		it it sounds like you have pretty normal pets though i guess uh you know a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> i mean i guess i've never cared for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> or um or gerbils or anything like that but <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> are about the only thing i think of when i think of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pets</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah i've i've never had any the ones that you just mentioned i have had a rabbit
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it was pretty interesting and it was like a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> it stayed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX> all the time and it used a litter box
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so it had free run of the house
 	
 	
 		was it as was it as friendly as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> or do you do you think you uh
 	
 	
 		uh not not to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">strangers</ENAMEX> not <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">strangers</ENAMEX> at all matter of fact it would run and hide but after it got to know you it was funny because it would jump up on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couch</ENAMEX> and sit right next to you you know and it kind of pants
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		hm
 	
 	
 		i didn't know a rabbit panted but  they pant kind of like a dog
 	
 	
 		neither did i
 		huh
 	
 	
 		and it's kind of funny because you can just sit there and pet them and
 		my rabbit got real large i think he was thirteen pounds
 	
 	
 		oh gee that is a big rabbit
 	
 	
 		so he was really big that was kind of funny looking
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		but uh was
 	
 	
 		but he was a good guard
 	
 	
 		was he
 	
 	
 		yeah at he heard every little noise and you could tell when a car drove up or anything
 	
 	
 		but but he's not much protection i would imagine
 	
 	
 		oh no no
 		no i don't think so
 	
 	
 		not not not an attack rabbit or anything like that
 	
 	
 		no nothing like that
 	
 	
 		not real protective but uh
 		well i i guess that's about  to say about <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pets</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">okay</ENAMEX> thanks bye-bye
 	
 	
 		all right well very nice speaking to you bye-bye
