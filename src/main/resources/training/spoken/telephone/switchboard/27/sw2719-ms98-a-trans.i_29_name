 
     		
 	
 		do you exercise a lot
 	
 	
 		um it's uh scaled back considerably uh right now my exercise is pretty much limited to uh softball <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">league</ENAMEX> and occasional ride on the bike
 		but uh i uh
 		i was just recently well <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recently nine months ago</TIMEX> got married and bought a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> so my outside activities have been curtailed somewhat
 	
 	
 		is mowing the lawn a new exercise
 	
 	
 		yeah lawn it's a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">forty year</TIMEX> old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> so we are doing a lot of refurbish work and uh yeah painting lawn gutters you name it  all kinds of stuff flower beds
 	
 	
 		oh my
 		i think that's considered exercise whether you want it or not
 	
 	
 		yeah that that's true that's true it's there's always something to do and uh
 		and and uh it keeps me going
 	
 	
 		well you're you are so far ahead of me i used to uh
 	
 	
 		but
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i used to walk <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">two miles</NUMEX> a day and i really enjoyed it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		because the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">two miles</NUMEX> went fairly quickly i could do it in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty eight minutes</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and that's not stopping and talking to everyone along the way but it's a lot you know it's not too strenuous
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and i could sort all kinds of things out and make plans and everything but i don't know what i did to my knee i
 		was crawling under a desk hooking up a computer
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i mashed it wrong or i did something
 	
 	
 		oh gosh
 	
 	
 		and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> has had me on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medication</ENAMEX> and she doesn't want me to walk she said that's you know while it's healing you're going to mess it up so i can't walk
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		and uh she said you know the most conservative approach you do the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX> you do the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX> again and again
 		before you think of surgery and i don't want her to think of surgery on my knee i don't want anyone to think about that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		no that that's a tough situation
 	
 	
 		ever
 		that's that microscopic stuff you know uh-huh not my kneecap
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so i'm i'm being very good
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but i miss it i really do and i
 	
 	
 		oh that it's so aggravating to uh to have an injury like that my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> uh
 		runs or likes to run but uh she's well we moved we moved down to the north end of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oak Cliff</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Castle Park</ENAMEX> area
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yeah and she started running down there and all the hills
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and she lasted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about two weeks</TIMEX> and her ankles couldn't take it anymore
 		she was used to running you know flat tracks and whatnot and uh
 		ever since that it's just been real difficult it's real aggravating because she starts in and her ankles will start hurting again and stuff
 		even if she does get on flat ground so she's kind of in the same mode She was all ready to
 		get back into it and start running uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K's</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K's</ENAMEX> and stuff <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this spring</TIMEX> and she just hasn't been able to stick with the training schedule long enough to really get back in shape
 		and when you want to do it it's really really aggravating you know it it's one thing to get motivated to start doing the exercise and it's another thing to to already
 		be past that and then not be able to because of your health
 	
 	
 		i can you understand that uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh i don't really want to i just know i need to
 	
 	
 		well it's
 	
 	
 		you know i make myself do it and if i do it okay i don't love it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know  but i will do it
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		uh it's not anything i would want to but i can really tell the difference since i have not been able to walk
 		i have got to be so much more careful with what i do
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah uh-huh it is and you know you you
 	
 	
 		it's depressing
 	
 	
 		you don't  well speaking for myself i don't sleep as well when i am not exercising and uh
 		it's really it's harder to get out of bed in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX> and all kinds of stuff it your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> just gets used to it and yeah i i don't particularly enjoy
 		well i i used to lift weights an awful lot and stuff like that i do enjoy riding bike but as far as the working out and lifting and things like that
 		uh i i can't say i really enjoyed it all that much but once i got used to it
 		it was habit forming it was i felt so bad if i didn't
 		physically i mean i just my body was was was uh tuned into that that mode
 		and if i if i skipped it then it  kind of threw the the whole the whole system out of whack
 	
 	
 		right right boy
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		hopefully my my knee is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred</NUMEX> percent better maybe i can get back into it
 	
 	
 		yeah that's for sure
 	
 	
 		i have ask you a question off the subject though you're in you're living in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Castle Park</ENAMEX> area

 		and uh it it's it 's really coming around i guess
 	
 	
 		i need to go over there and just drive around and look
 	
 	
 		it's it's worth the trip
 	
 	
 		oh i'm sure it must be
 		i'm just we had a lovely little <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX> over there it was like a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> story
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		well story and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a half really</TIMEX> because we had a basement
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> that built it was weird
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i mean weird
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's one of these really creative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> that i grew up in that nothing was on the same level with anything else
 	
 	
 		okay
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		and i just loved the neighborhood and i mean everyone everyone had <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> like that They were all completely different
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh</ENAMEX> that's right
 	
 	
 		and so neat
 	
 	
 		yeah ours ours is kind of a little ranch style with a great big oh i guess it's <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty eight</TIMEX> by fifteen front porch and uh next door we've got an <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Austin</ENAMEX> stone
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		across the street the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> just uh it was burnt out <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about two years ago</TIMEX> and and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> moved in and completely redid it and it's got oh it's got a rounded
 		front on it it's all brick and he's he's landscaped his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">yard</ENAMEX> and he's about ready to put in a pool and things like that so
 		yeah there's a variety you just don't see it anywhere else as far as the different styles in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> and whatnot
 	
 	
 		now why couldn't your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> run around the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">golf course</ENAMEX> is that not good
 	
 	
 		um
 		oh she could a little bit we i tell you what we got into the fitness <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Methodist</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh was he
 	
 	
 		and they have <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a quarter mile</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">track</ENAMEX> there
 		so she has started doing that rather than uh rather than take off
 		the problem is she's a school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> and for her she can't run in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX> For her to get <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> and try to run at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">six o'clock in the night</TIMEX> in the winter time it's starting to get dark and
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		you know you don't want to she doesn't want to be out by herself anywhere in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> regardless whether it's north <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> or whatnot and
 		when she goes over to this fitness center it's fenced in and there's somebody in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> watching her and all that so there's a lot of consideration
 	
 	
 		yes i i really hear that you know i think you know you're in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oak Cliff</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but i'm in Plano In west Plano
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and we live on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of those blocks that it's a neighborhood watch block we all know each other and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> doesn't go anywhere
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		right
 	
 	
 		if you are on the street you better belong there
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		because it's not a through street
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		and still i want to get up <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early in the morning</TIMEX> and walk before this knee business and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		had a lot of heartburn with that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i mean
 		it looked darker to him because he he was in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> with the lights on
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		when i was out walking it was more of a pre dawn type pretty
 		but huh-uh he didn't think it looked pre <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">dawn</TIMEX> to him it looked dark and even he was real concerned about that so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's not just because you are in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oak Cliff</ENAMEX> it's just because you're smart that you don't do things like that
 	
 	
 		that's right that's right it only takes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time that is it's a hard lesson to learn so
 	
 	
 		that's right
 		there's only one crazy out there you know to make any difference
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 		yeah it's you know it goes all over well we got this
