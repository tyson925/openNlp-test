 		did puppy go to
 	
 	
 		well the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">puppy</ENAMEX> jumped in the into some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pools</ENAMEX> but not into the i was careful to keep her away from the
 	
 	
 		oh that's good yeah
 	
 	
 		the fast moving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> because if she fell in then i'd of been had to go in after her
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and up here the waters probably <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about forty</NUMEX> degrees right now

 		this dog <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dennis</ENAMEX> jumped in and got this look on his face like what do i do now as he's floating down the river then finally discovered that he could swim and uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		actually paddled up against the current and uh made it back to the shore and climbed up and then he
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		he jumped in again and he was swimming for quite a bit <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">all afternoon</TIMEX> he loved it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cocoa</ENAMEX> didn't think too much of it though she jumped in and then started screaming and uh made me pull her back out
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i pulled her out and uh then had to wrap her up in a sweatshirt because she was shivering so bad and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so but she got over it
 		so
 	
 	
 		well the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">German Shepherd</ENAMEX> that i had before we we had a little pool
