 
     		
 	
 		uh so i uh weight train uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three days</TIMEX> on and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX> off
 	
 	
 		uh so what do you do to exercise
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i uh ride <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bicycles  um fifteen twenty</ENAMEX> miles
 		i don't know maybe <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times maybe <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> times a week i play <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">basketball</ENAMEX> uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">couple</NUMEX> times a week i play softball <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one night</TIMEX> a week
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		uh that's what i do what about yourself
 	
 	
 		hm that's pretty impressive um  i guess i bicycle uh the amount varies <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">as much as a hundred fifty miles</NUMEX> a week um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i guess i play softball <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one night</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a week</TIMEX> and i backpack a lot over the summer
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yeah that's that's about the extent of it i mean i don't do any of those things particularly you know for exercise
 		but um i guess the bicycling is the one thing i'll sort of like do if i feel like i need to go exercise um but i do it mostly for fun
 	
 	
 		yeah what um what do you ride uh like bunch of hills or flat pretty flat
 	
 	
 		it it it varies uh out near my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> is pretty hilly um but sometimes i <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bike</ENAMEX> to work which is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about um a fifteen mile</NUMEX> trip each way and that's mostly flat
 	
 	
 		how long does that take you to get to work
 	
 	
 		<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about forty five fifty</NUMEX> minutes
 	
 	
 		how does how does that work work out with uh storing your <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bike</ENAMEX> and showering and all that
 	
 	
 		yeah it can be a pain um
 		basically uh i work on a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">campus</ENAMEX> so i can store my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bike</ENAMEX> in my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> and walk across the uh <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">campus</ENAMEX> to the uh gym use the shower there uh but it's it's enough of a pain that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i did it consistently <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one year</TIMEX> i would commute everyday um
 		but it just became such a pain i mean we were talking you know forty <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">fifty minutes</TIMEX> for biking um and sometimes longer if you had adverse wind
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and then <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">another half an hour</TIMEX> you know to cool down and take a shower and all this kind of stuff it was a big hunk of well hunk of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> um and then of course another hour to get back home um
 		so i've been doing that less and and concentrating more on you know light biking when i get <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the evening</TIMEX> and then you know some more on the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekends</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah do you ride a lot of rallies are lot of those around there
 	
 	
 		not so much um
 		i guess mostly i <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bike</ENAMEX> on my own i've got a touring <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bike</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um though i haven't gone on any extended trips with it how about you what kind of biking do you do
 	
 	
 		uh well actually my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> just got me into it and i did a did an internship at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institute for Aerobics Research</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cooper Clinic</ENAMEX> and i learned all the health benefits of
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i you know i was a solid weight <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trainer</ENAMEX> and all i did was weights and anaerobic exercise and then my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> got me into the aerobic exercise said you really need to do it so
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		once i got into this uh internship i learned all the physiological advantages advantages
 		advantages to it so i began a program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> i don't know probably <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three or four weeks ago</TIMEX> and i did my <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bike</ENAMEX> rally  <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this Saturday</TIMEX> i did uh <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">forty forty</NUMEX> miles
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		and uh that's the longest i've ever ridden so far i usually you know fifteen or <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty</TIMEX>  and it was it was kind of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">hilly</NUMEX> and it was pretty tough but
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh i'm looking at uh doing a lot more of it because you know my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> is really into it and i i kind of
 	
 	
 		oh i see
 	
 	
 		held her back a little bit this <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this weekend</TIMEX> she wanted to go go go but you know she wanted to stay with me
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		it's good to have a partner
 	
 	
 		yeah it really is
 	
 	
 		are you you thinking of doing any like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">centuries</TIMEX> or
 	
 	
 		yeah that'd be cool sometime if i could you know work up to that
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah i just wondered if you're were gonna do that mostly or more like you know uh um
 		uh touring like from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vermont</ENAMEX> or you know that kind of thing i mean <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> seem to get into different aspects one is more of a distance and one's more just you know they wanna
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		put some equipment on their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bike</ENAMEX> and go for a tour
 	
 	
 		i've never really looked into that that you know that's my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> would just love that and i may do that sometime there again i'm just kind of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">fledgling</ENAMEX> into this
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i've it's kind of funny i'd called this number and i just reading through a a bicycle <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> and going through all the different tours coming up i mean around <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> you got
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		you got <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about five</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> different if you live around the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> area you got <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five or six every weekend</TIMEX> to choose from because they're really into it
 	
 	
 		oh that's nice
 		hm
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bicycling</ENAMEX>'s really big here i didn't know that and you know till i came down here and just kind of caught the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">fever</ENAMEX>  because i lived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indiana</ENAMEX> all my life and
 	
 	
 		wow yeah
 	
 	
 		you know you may say one see <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one or two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> on a bicycle that are above the age of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fifteen</ENAMEX> or something but other than that it's nothing up there like it is down here
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah i'm not sure why that is i mean generally in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">midwest</ENAMEX> it seems to be less much less i mean maybe it's because of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winters</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		probably
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> or maybe just because you know there's there's a lot more flat lands you know out in the west so it makes biking a better alternative for transportation
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah and  there's a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bikers</ENAMEX> around here it's it's really neat
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		there are a lot of a lot of resources lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazines</ENAMEX> and stuff little <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texas Bicyclist</ENAMEX> is like a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX> that comes out <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every month</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		and it's free you just go to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bike shock bike bike</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX> and pick it up and it's got all the rides coming up so i guess i'm gonna be busy about every <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday this summer</TIMEX> going to a different ride yeah see a little bit of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> i've never seen before
 	
 	
 		oh that's terrific
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so uh how long have you been biking
 	
 	
 		oh i guess
 		as an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult</ENAMEX> for just about the past uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three years</TIMEX> or so
 		um
 		you know i guess the last time i did it before that was college which was about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten years ago</TIMEX> and uh yeah i guess i just never really thought about it much for a while um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		until i suddenly disevered all my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> were basically biking a lot  and so i thought i'd try it too
 	
 	
 		have you ever had a uh it's kind of slightly off the subject but you ever had a uh a blood work up done recently or since you been biking to see if it because it really
 	
 	
 		no i haven't no
 	
 	
 		from what i understand it really improves your uh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> and and you know it uh it kind of knocks you down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> uh the big risk categories for coronary artery <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> which is uh
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		uh low cardiovascular fitness and also uh you know the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> it gives you uh increased <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HDLs</ENAMEX> and decreases your LDLs yeah so
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		oh that's great yeah i've i've definitely noticed it's had a good effect on my pulse rate my resting pulse you know it gets it down to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about forty</NUMEX> yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		really that's good
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you say you ride <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about a hundred hundred</NUMEX> fifty miles a week <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> that's that's hard core when do you get to begin with the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winters</TIMEX> and all that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		on average yeah
 	
 	
 		or what time of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> do you usually embark on your do you ride inside if you can't ride outside
 	
 	
 		no i'm not that hard-core i mean there are some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in fact there are a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who'll ride outside in the snow they've got a uh mountain bike you know with the big knobby tires
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i don't do that i basically i i pretty much lay off for the winter uh-hum i was thinking of getting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rollers</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last winter</TIMEX> you know because it'll help your balance when you're indoor training
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		um but but i just you know more or less stuck to like an exercise bike and that kind of thing um
 		but yeah i mean <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winters</TIMEX> are kind of a problem so i'm more or less out of shape now that i've been biking i guess <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">just a couple of weeks</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um but you know up here it's  it's only stopped snowing since then uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but yeah it's it's it's it's pretty good it's uh the main
 		the main thing i guess for me is just to enjoy it because once it starts seeming like you know exercise and a chore i'll lay off of it more
 	
 	
 		right
 		so you uh change up your routes a lot and keep a
 	
 	
 		oh yeah yeah i try to go someplace pretty different you know <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every week</TIMEX> i rotate around um <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about four</NUMEX> different routes
 		um from my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> or i'll sometimes come in to school it's nice coming it's nice it's nice riding to school because it's all along a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canal</ENAMEX> path
 		um because it's just it's along the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Erie Canal</ENAMEX> up here  uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Rochester</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so what <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> is it
 		oh okay
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so that's fairly picturesque and uh so it's it's it's a good ride as long as you're not doing it everyday it's a good ride
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah that's true sounds neat it's kind of i was wondering if i was gonna
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		talk with someone that never has exercised before and doesn't want to and everything else but got a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> that rides <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred and fifty</NUMEX> miles <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a week</TIMEX> that's something motivating
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that's really good
 		well
 	
 	
 		well it was good talking to you
 	
 	
 		good talking to you and keep up the good work all right take care bye
 	
 	
 		okay you too
 		bye
