 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">okay Jean um</ENAMEX> could you tell me what you what you think about uh gun control
 	
 	
 		well
 		i think we have a lot of laws on the books right now that if they were
 		kept and followed would take care of a lot of the problems we have
 	
 	
 		as as far as firearms go
 		or as far as firearms going or is it just uh the
 	
 	
 		pardon
 		yes
 		the gun the gun control
 	
 	
 		gun controls yeah i'm not really all that sure on on
 		uh what the federal regulations are but it seems like each <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> has their own
 		or at  at least that's what my belief is is that each <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> has their own regulations
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know some require uh uh a permit
 		and some don't some require waiting periods and some don't um
 	
 	
 		right
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		we require permits like if you're going to carry a pistol for protection or for whatever reason you you know have you to have a permit for that
 	
 	
 		right that's
 		that's what it is up here it's like that too you need uh as far as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">rifle</ENAMEX> or anything like that no you can just go out and buy it um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		i i just i just don't feel that uh a stronger restrictions is going to stop a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> who really wants to have one for misuse
 		i really don't personally feel that it's going to help
 	
 	
 		no unless it's a like one of those automatic weapons
 	
 	
 		well those we don't need
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know i can see there are uh gun <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">collectors</ENAMEX> that you know go out and collect all these and there are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that go out and fire on ranges and things
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um if you want an automatic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapon</ENAMEX> just for that because you certainly
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		don't need it going out hunting
 	
 	
 		no no no
 	
 	
 		um then i think
 	
 	
 		somebody's who's into into shooting though like you say sharpshooters or uh that type of thing wouldn't be so bad but uh
 	
 	
 		yep
 		i yeah i think that should be regulated
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		those types of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX> as far as a pistol
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		anybody and uh
 		and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">uncle</ENAMEX> can get a pistol anytime they want um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		i don't think the laws
 		are going to keep them from getting them if they really want one
 	
 	
 		no no what i
 	
 	
 		i just i really don't believe that
 	
 	
 		what i think should happen is uh any violent crime with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapon</ENAMEX> with a with a pistol
 		or or a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">rifle</ENAMEX> for that matter
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i think they should prosecute to the fullest extent of the law
 	
 	
 		oh definitely definitely
 	
 	
 		and that's that's what they're not doing now
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh</ENAMEX> that's i say if they would use the laws they have on the books
 		i think it would stop quite a bit of what goes on
 		but they're i don't know it it sometimes seems like they're too lenient with some things but yet if a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> steals a loaf of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bread</ENAMEX> for their family
 		he's in worse trouble than they are
 	
 	
 		right they crucify him
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um
 		but yeah i don't know if it's i don't know if it's the judicial system like the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judges</ENAMEX> that are too lenient
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		because there are precedents saying you know well it's
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		he really didn't mean to do it it was a fit of anger or or uh he had too much to drink or he was on dope and he didn't know what he was doing
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh i don't really buy that i mean
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		if he if he drank too much he knew he drank too much or or if he was on dope he knew he was he was what was going to happen when he when he took it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah it's kind of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cop</ENAMEX> out
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but yet i've seen some
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jury</ENAMEX> trials where the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> feel sorry for the whoever did whatever they did
 	
 	
 		oh you definitely
 	
 	
 		and they and they're lenient they go lenient on them and then after they sit there and i read the paper and i say she you know
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		i think a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> put themselves in the place in the place of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> that has done the crime
 		and they think of how they would react and then they don't think anybody could do the things that this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> is accused of doing
 	
 	
 		yep yeah
 	
 	
 		and i think that sometimes colors some of their feelings on uh
 	
 	
 		you're probably right uh a lot of cases too it is
 		um in a fit of anger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> do things that they regret for the rest of their life
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		right right
 	
 	
 		but yet
 		there are also the others
 		that commit crimes over and over and over again and
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		they're out on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> after a short sentence
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		those are the ones that you know should get the book thrown at them on
 	
 	
 		they should be kept there and overcrowding of course that has a lot to do with i think a lot of times with uh the type of sentence that's given
 		you know what's available for keeping them
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		what
 	
 	
 		let's
 		yeah um
 		i grew up in a rural <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">area</ENAMEX> and we've always uh we've always hunted i've hunted for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> until i got older and then i i just hung my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX> up and i just kind of
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know i'd rather go out with a camera <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">now and</TIMEX> and shoot the animals
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i don't have a my my my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> and my <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> he hunted uh
 	
 	
 		yeah well we we passed a or the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> passed an ordinance that it's against the law now to to shoot a firearm off in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> and it's it's still a rural <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">area</ENAMEX> and it's still <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">farms</ENAMEX> and orchards and
 	
 	
 		so
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and we live
 		right down by next to the reservoir so there's a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ducks</ENAMEX> and you know there's all kinds of wild <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> it was like a shooting gallery down there
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		well some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have no sense at all in shooting  to know how far to be away from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> and that to shoot i mean
 		some of them use no s ense at all
 	
 	
 		right
 		yep yep because we didn't but a neighbor of ours had uh uh a bullet came came through right right through the side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well we've had that happen in our area also um-hum
 	
 	
 		
 
 		so but since they've done that since they've limited hunting
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it's been uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> are back the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> are back it's uh it's peaceful
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so our <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> got together
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so maybe uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> have to do that if you
 	
 	
 		well i think it depends on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX> now we're rural also and our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> are not
 		they're not that close like we have a shooting range across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> from our home
 		but it's far enough away we have fields around it
 	
 	
 		it's a regular oh but
 	
 	
 		and it's
 		it's far enough away from you know <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that type of thing that uh
 	
 	
 		it's a what is it like a rod and gun club
 	
 	
 		no it's just our own personal
 	
 	
 		oh okay so it's
 	
 	
 		we just have a a personal lot yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		it's for you oh okay
 	
 	
 		now we do have a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sportsman</ENAMEX>'s uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">club</ENAMEX> who has a an indoor shooting range
 		and it's very nice our our <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> was a sharpshooter
 		he was interested yeah he was interested in that then uh
 	
 	
 		oh isn't that good yeah
 	
 	
 		did a
 	
 	
 		so what is he does he have to follow certain rules and regulations  because he's a uh sharpshooter or
 	
 	
 		uh no not really he doesn't do it now because he's not here he lives in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX>
 		now and so he he really hasn't been doing too much shooting lately
 	
 	
 		yep
 	
 	
 		but he he really did enjoy it
 	
 	
 		but
 		but he had to have a special permit to carry a gun from place to place
 	
 	
 		um
 		i don't think they had to have not for shooting not for their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">rifles</ENAMEX> and that
 		it would be just like uh going hunting you don't need a permit to carry you know you're not allowed to carry them loaded or anything like that
 	
 	
 		oh okay yeah i know
 		right yeah
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		so you just need a hunting license
 	
 	
 		no no i don't think so uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">rifles</ENAMEX> that they use like in their uh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh ROTC</ENAMEX>
 		now i think they had to they i think they had to do a little bit more when they use them they also had a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">club</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">college</ENAMEX> here
 	
 	
 		oh okay yep
 	
 	
 		that he shot in and
 	
 	
 		ah okay
 	
 	
 		they had a few more restrictions there
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah so he was probably following
 		whatever the protocol was for the military
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		so i kind of agree with you then that uh uh the only the only thing i would like to see them regulate is is the automatic weapons
 	
 	
 		yeah there's no there's really no call for
 		for that that type of weapon
 	
 	
 		but as far as everything else uh if they
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		if they followed the rules and regulations and the laws that were already in place
 		i think that uh uh
 		that would suffice we wouldn't have to go any further we wouldn't have to put more regulations out there
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh</ENAMEX> now the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX> said they she wanted us to rate from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> as to how we felt on a one being uh
 	
 	
 		that's right a a total ban
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		on on
 	
 	
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten ten</NUMEX> would be no regulations at all let's see no wait how was it
 	
 	
 		yeah right <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten</TIMEX> was no no restrictions whatsoever and one being was uh
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		uh a total ban
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know or totally restrictive
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i kind of think uh
 		probably a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> i would go with
 	
 	
 		i would go along with that
 		a happy medium so to speak
 	
 	
 		uh that's
 		yeah i'd like to see them restrict just those like i said before those new automatic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX> but the rest of it i don't think they need anymore
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		okay so i guess we kind of we've solved that problem right
 	
 	
 		i don't know if we solved it but  it is a problem and it unfortunately uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i'm not real crazy about <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX> myself but being from hunting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> i
 		tolerate them
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah well that's
 	
 	
 		and i like i like them to learn their safety rules and that and and i think that is good that they have to have a uh now here at least
 		they have a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hunter</ENAMEX>'s safety course that the the young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have to take before they're allowed to hunt yes
 	
 	
 		have to take before they ah that's good that is
 	
 	
 		they they have to do that before they can get a license to hunt
 	
 	
 		yeah and any responsible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> or any responsible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hunter</ENAMEX> is going to is going to go through some kind of a a course like that um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
