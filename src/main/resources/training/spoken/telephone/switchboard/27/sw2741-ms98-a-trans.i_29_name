 
     		
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		alrighty i think one of the most significant changes that have happened is that they've changed from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homemaker</ENAMEX> to the work market  and for several reasons probably some of that is divorce
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and some is they're more educated than they used to be i think
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um i think sometimes uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> in government they've become more uh adroit in that area too instead of just <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> all the time have more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> in government
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and now i'll let you say something
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well uh i probably a little bit older than you are so what i see um is the change that i see the most is the is that um
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> have much more many more occupations and careers to choose from than when i went went to college when i went to college you could be a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> or maybe a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurse</ENAMEX> or a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX> or
 		but there were very few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> in business at that time a few but they were the oddity and
 	
 	
 		very limited
 	
 	
 		yes and now i see and and i see for my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> which is wonderful  she's thirteen and i see a whole wonderful world out there that she can choose from so many different jobs which i think is terrific because
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yes
 	
 	
 		i'm a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> and i mean i love teaching but though i think there are a lot of other things i would have liked better and um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		not that i would give the career up because it's it's a safe career plus because i always have a job plus i am a single <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> too and i and i need the income
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		right
 	
 	
 		but uh and i think that's a reason why a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> have have started to work too is because economically it's just a must
 	
 	
 		i think that's right
 	
 	
 		uh you just it's very difficult to get along on one income unless uh the male uh has an extraordinarily good job
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and especially <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> who teach school they don't make that much money and and most all they always either have they're either moonlighting or else their their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> works too
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		um it's just an economic need now
 	
 	
 		i really think <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> have so much more responsibility than you know as far as everything
 	
 	
 		oh definitely
 	
 	
 		and like you said um <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> today have so many uh the average <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> of having a a single family you know with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> as the head is just really um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so commonplace nowadays
 	
 	
 		oh yes exactly we have uh quite a few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> at our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> that are single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh the majority is uh married <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> but still there's a lot more than there used to be and see you never picture yourself in a situation like this when i married i thought i'd be married the rest of my life
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		and uh but i'm all i'm really grateful that i went to college my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> always said you know get an education in case you need one because my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> died when we were i have a twin <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> and we were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eleven</NUMEX> when he died
 		she had a nursing degree and she was able to make it but she said in just you never know what's going to happen and i thank God that i did go to college and got a degree because otherwise i don't know how i would be able to raise my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		you know isn't that funny uh because the same thing happened to us except i was twelve and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> had a nursing degree and was able to make it in her profession and was isn't that funny
 	
 	
 		isn't that something
 		yes
 	
 	
 		uh but just that they were able to do it you know and even <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> i think the chance for education is is so much uh better for all of our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> and and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> too but but the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> especially
 	
 	
 		yes
 		oh yes
 		yeah i do too but i think it needs to continue to change and i mean i think it there's still not equality as far as uh paychecks for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> i think that the we still have a long way to go
 	
 	
 		a lot of things yeah
 	
 	
 		um-hum and i think that uh uh i think by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year two thousand</TIMEX> it we're going to see  some a lot more changes uh hopefully that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> are you know able to get the the executive jobs and hold positions that men
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> do because they can do it just as well you know if they want to dedicate their uh most of their time to that they're they're they can do it
 	
 	
 		yeah and i also think that in the future that uh it's gonna continue that we're not gonna see a lax off of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> in the work force i think they're going to stay there and i think that they're gonna
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">hum-um</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh be really responsible and and do everything just like what you said you know make make it the grade and and make it so <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> can be the top <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in their in their field
 	
 	
 		exactly exactly and i think that's the way it should be i think it i mean not that i i think that i'm equal to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> because there's a lot of things that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> can do that i
 	
 	
 		oh i think so
 	
 	
 		could never do strengthwise and so forth but also there's some things <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> can do like have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> can't do
 	
 	
 		right
 		
 
 		right
 	
 	
 		so you know it it i don't want i don't want to be equal but i i want to be i want  to get what i deserve and i want to be able to be on the same level with them if i can do a job as well as i man i think i should get the same pay you know
 	
 	
 		exactly exactly
 	
 	
 		yeah and i just i'm not a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>'s libber i really am not but i i think that well that we have
 		just as many rights as they do and i feel like if there's a qualified <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> to do the job and if she's good or better than a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> then she they should get the job with the same pay
 	
 	
 		that's right and i think that is happening more and more i think it's just gonna take a little bit longer
 	
 	
 		i do too
 		oh i do too definitely definitely
 	
 	
 		well great okay
 	
 	
 		well it was good to talk to you
 	
 	
 		good to talk to you <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sally</ENAMEX> thanks bye-bye
 	
 	
 		all right bye-bye
