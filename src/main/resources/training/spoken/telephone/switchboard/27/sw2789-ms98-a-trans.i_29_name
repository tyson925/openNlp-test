 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		as far as you know uh instead of having to join a health <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">club</ENAMEX> and make myself go out there i went and bought a weight bench and don't ever hardly use it need to need to make myself do that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		right yeah
 		yeah i slacked off a little because of um
 		i'm about to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">graduate</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">college</ENAMEX> and so <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this past couple months</TIMEX> have been really hectic so i haven't really gone and i've really been faithful <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these past two months</TIMEX> of going to the health <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">club</ENAMEX> and working out but
 	
 	
 		what school you going to
 	
 	
 		i'm at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East Carolina</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		but um
 		no i uh my step classes and toning is about the only thing well i mean
 	
 	
 		now what's what's toning is that lifting lifting weights
 	
 	
 		it's it's um like isolated movements for each muscle certain muscles <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> you can do with
 	
 	
 		oh okay isometrics stuff like that
 	
 	
 		yeah you can do it with certain you know you can do it with weights if you wanted to but you know you leave out of there usually <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the next morning</TIMEX> if you haven't done it in a while you wake up <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the next morning</TIMEX> you're like oh no what did i do to myself and your whole <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> aches you know um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i know i'm looking forward to getting back into
 		getting into shape uh
 		i feel like i'm out of shape but i feel guilty for not going because i really i'm i'm so used to going for you know <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three or four years</TIMEX> now but um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah i
 		stayed in pretty good shape during school i played baseball all the way through and you know working out <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">six hours a day</TIMEX> usually <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six or seven days a week</TIMEX> that kind of kept us all in pretty good shape
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh yeah
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh ever ever since i got out of school you know just jumped right into the job and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i guess the job that i'm in it's stuff to stay on any kind of a regular schedule
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		because i work some weird <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> and do some traveling and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		no some
 		um
 		i walk a lot because uh you know being in in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> we i don't know if your <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">campus</ENAMEX> was anything like ours but our parking lot's in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one end of the</TIMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">campus</ENAMEX> and the school the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> are all at the other end so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		no i didn't have well much of a problem we i guess i went to a small <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Baptist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> and we had about when i was there maybe thirteen <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundred</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>  so it's pretty small yeah
 	
 	
 		uh-huh oh okay that's if yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but i usually get in <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">at least a couple of miles</NUMEX> at work <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">just</TIMEX> walking around the plant
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		yeah it's uh
 		i live i live on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> story <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartments</ENAMEX> so i walk up and down stairs <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all day</TIMEX> long so
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		uh we've got a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> story <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX> now that's that's enough i guess i push the lawn mower around that's fairly regular
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that's one of the exercise now i i um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		would like to start running
 		i've never been much of a runner but i want to start i want to run but i don't i don't know if i'll be able to to do it
 	
 	
 		what just because you you don't like to or because because you won't be able to
 	
 	
 		i'm  i'm afraid i won't be able to i wish i'd
 	
 	
 		oh if you do if you do aerobics you shouldn't have any problem running
 	
 	
 		yeah i hope not
 		oh
 	
 	
 		we've we've ride our <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bike</ENAMEX> occasionally but again not nearly often enough
 	
 	
 		uh-huh i don't even own a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bike</ENAMEX> i think the last time i was on a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bike</ENAMEX> when i was about twelve so
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh i don't know i'd be afraid  afraid i probably forgot how to ride a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bike</ENAMEX> you know
 	
 	
 		no you can't forget how to ride a bike
 	
 	
 		yeah but um
 		no i guess
 		that's about the only form i'm trying to think of of other things that i do that
 		would be considered exercise  or things i should do
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">now</TIMEX> when i was going to i i went to a junior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">college</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of years</TIMEX> and played <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">baseball</ENAMEX> and then transferred well when we were at this junior college uh
 	
 	
 		i know
 	
 	
 		our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coach</ENAMEX> you know we one semester the whole <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> was required to take aerobics and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next semester</TIMEX> they were required to do weight lifting
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so they uh i mean it was a regular i mean we had it for course credit but still i mean it was pretty high impact stuff
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		those aerobic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX> are are tough the the high impact
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		definitely are are tough classes
 	
 	
 		yeah and she'd uh you know most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> were all in one <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> so she'd kind of lay it on occasionally you know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> thing eight i think we had <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">eight o'clock in the morning</TIMEX> was our class
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		wake up
 	
 	
 		well now they have those uh
 		those exercise bands now that are better that you can use for like toning instead of using a weight you have like bands i don't know if you've seen them they're
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah i think my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> has some
 	
 	
 		yeah they're they're weird they're uh you get uh
 		they're just made of i guess it's different kinds of rubber uh and they get
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		or sand even some of them well no they're elastic so i guess it wouldn't be sand
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh</ENAMEX> and there's some that
 		like the different colors denotes how much they
 		how much the tension i guess they are and how easy they are to move
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		uh there's like i know there's purple gray and uh green and some of them are real short and they're the ones that are the tough ones to use you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		those classes i i enjoy uh i think uh
 		with the aerobic classes you have to get an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">instructor</ENAMEX> that's
 		fun if you don't have one that's fun and not enjoy it look not acting like she's enjoying what she's doing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> is not going to get out uh what they should get out of the class
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh
 		if the
 	
 	
 		so are you going to get into instructing well what are you studying
 	
 	
 		oh i'm an interior design major
 	
 	
 		oh okay  not in the not in the
 		aerobic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">instructor</ENAMEX> type field
 	
 	
 		oh no no no no oh i could never do that i don't think
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i'd rather just be the student
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		oh occasionally i do the weights at the health <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">club</ENAMEX> but
 		low weights just
 	
 	
 		yeah the uh the some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Nautilus</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">equipment</ENAMEX> that i started seeing at the one that we used to go to was really interesting i mean they they they really know how to isolate each of the different muscle groups
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		with those things but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> they are
 		ah uh i don't know to me that was just too much of a hassle to get all geared up and take the time to drive over there and workout and then drive back
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		right well they um i just noticed at our health <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">club</ENAMEX> they
 		they put on these computerized one these computerized machines and you set a speed on it and the weight and it and it makes you do it and it tells you like if you're going too slow it will say my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandmother</ENAMEX> could do this faster than you
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and stuff like a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">turtle</ENAMEX> goes faster and um it tells it and the whole place can hear what this machine is telling you
 	
 	
 		a little negative reinforcement there while you're going
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		so uh do that stuff like that but just i've never used those machines i just use the regular
 		machines and the free weights you know like little <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> pound hand weights and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> pound hand weights
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		just to do you know some bicep tricep exercises
 		sit-ups of course
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah that's that's where i'm really starting to get noticeable i'm just getting real soft in the middle
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh yeah
 		i think that's uh number one problem with everyone
 	
 	
 		um-hum i haven't really started to put on a lot of weight i'm i guess i probably put on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about ten nine</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> pounds since i stopped playing which was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about four years ago</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but i've just myself i just notice myself just really real soft and i'm sure i don't have near the endurance that i did
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but i i intend i keep saying i intend to get back into it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i just need to
 		put <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the old</TIMEX> nose to the grindstone i i i guess at that point it would turn into a task
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i don't consider it fun doing that but
 	
 	
 		right yeah i plan on getting back once i graduate <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">next</TIMEX> weekend
 	
 	
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next weekend</TIMEX> all right
