 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
  
 		okay uh let me see we were supposed to talk about are consumer goods better or worse and have you had to take anything back recently have you
 	
 	
 		
  
 		let's see yeah i'm always returning things but i have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> and um a lot of times it's just because it doesn't fit the way that i thought it was going to well that's really clothes isn't it  consumer goods
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		trying to think no i haven't returned anything lately
 	
 	
 		i haven't either i think things must be getting better
 	
 	
 		well i haven't bought that much really
 	
 	
 		oh my goodness that could explain it
 	
 	
 		no it's true i think if you're talking about major appliances like stereos and refrigerators and washing machines i mean we've had a lot all ours for quite a while and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		of course they're probably all <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> too i'm sorry
 	
 	
 		it's hard to tell anymore who owns what by the names isn't it
 	
 	
 		i know it i know it
 		and i really would like to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> but i don't think it's possible i think it except for maybe in clothes but i think all the electronics are
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know basically they're  assembled in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i look for that tag i look for that because i well uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> i bought a curling iron for my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> and there was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> that were the same price and one had a made in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i do too
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		you know tag so i just picked it up i said i'll buy that one yeah i'm trying to be more conscientious about that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that's how come i like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wal-Mart</ENAMEX> you know they try and buy usually all yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah that's where i bought it as a matter of fact yeah
 	
 	
 		that's why i prefer if i'm going to shop at a discount place that's where i like to shop is because of that because i realistically we ought to keep stuff at home and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but  no i don't think i have returned anything in a
 		in a long time uh
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah but you know i think our expectations expectations are a lot lower than they used to be
 	
 	
 		yeah i do too
 	
 	
 		you you know just in general when you buy something you never i mean
 	
 	
 		i don't i never expect anything to i'm amazed when things last like my refrigerator here <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten years</TIMEX> you know i'm amazed
 	
 	
 		and and
 		right
 	
 	
 		but it
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i'm always waiting for something to go on it but and if something does don't you always try to fix it before you ever bring it in because you know you're never going to see it again
 	
 	
 		me too
 		yeah right but now days uh getting it fixed is almost as much as going out and buying a new one
 	
 	
 		it's worse the service is worse it really is than buying new because <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">um people</ENAMEX> just don't know how to fix things now and yeah
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh</ENAMEX> it really
 		i know it they don't keep up with the new technology you know and
 	
 	
 		right and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> that's really bad too
 	
 	
 		oh that's the worse
 	
 	
 		we have uh  <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mini van</ENAMEX> and the door the sliding door on it has never worked right and we've had it back <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twice</NUMEX> to have parts replaced and stuff and they just can't
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		have you really
 	
 	
 		you know i don't i i don't i think there was just something wrong with the door originally and then i don't think the service <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have the foggiest idea of how to fix it
 	
 	
 		i know it and you know i you think you ought to take it back to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealer</ENAMEX> because they know them but gosh they're so high they just rip you off
 	
 	
 		oh they're terrible oh i i try to avoid the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">dealer</ENAMEX> unless you know i think they that's the worst service i've ever gotten anywhere is in a dealer
 	
 	
 		i do too i absolutely have to have
 		me too and if they'd only realize that that's what what gets me back to i have quit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chevrolet</ENAMEX> both because the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX> were so lousy they gave me lousy service they and uh so i've
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah
 		yep
 	
 	
 		it wasn't the car  well it was the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> but i think the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> could have been taken care of if a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealer</ENAMEX> had backed it up but they didn't
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		right but you know we're not from this part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> and it i've never had uh we're from up north in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New England</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> it is uh real different up there with the service
 	
 	
 		is it really
 	
 	
 		really different when you make an appointment for a certain time during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> so you don't have to always drop it off first thing in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX> and you drop it off and sometimes they run late but never they never keep it
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		i mean  i can't say never i just say in my experience they'll say well you know they'll get it if they're done if they're not going to get it done they will at least tell you down here they just lie to you
 	
 	
 		yeah i've had my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> has been in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a week a week ago</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> i put it in for a new vinyl top and some hail damage and found out i bummed a ride
 	
 	
 		uh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>

 		to work <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all week</TIMEX>  well you know i still had to go to the grocery <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX> and to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX> and you i just have to have a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> so i finally ended up renting a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> and i i you know
 	
 	
 		yep

 		that's ridiculous that you have to do that

 		see but i just can't understand that i mean i i because they haven't gotten to it yet probably
 	
 	
 		i know it they uh you they don't <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> don't want to work anymore i i'd what
 	
 	
 		right
 		i just can't see that
 	
 	
 		i tried to get uh when i moved i moved up here from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> and i wanted to get a uh my
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">patio</ENAMEX> covered because down there we everybody had screened in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">porches</ENAMEX> and they're so pretty and they're so reasonable and everything and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		gosh i can't believe the prices they all quoted me on i said my God no wonder you <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> are suffering up here the the prices you're charging for and i finally ended up getting a
 	
 	
 		really
 		
 
 		yep
 	
 	
 		a steel uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh top but it wasn't uh uh i wanted an aluminum uh and i wanted it insulated from the heat but this is just steel and then he charged me
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		um
 	
 	
 		oh gosh i think <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">nine hundred dollars</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Orlando</ENAMEX> i got the whole thing done screened in the carpeting they insulated the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the gutters</TIMEX> and everything for fifteen <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">hundred dollars</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		no kidding
 		oh my goodness
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gosh</ENAMEX> now up here i couldn't even begin to i couldn't begin to afford a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">room</ENAMEX> like that up here so i just
 	
 	
 		that's something
 		yeah
 		yeah i'll tell you another thing about um
 		about um appliances too um
 		i'm uh more apt to try and get them fixed now than buy a new one just simply to keep from throwing things away
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know that kind of isn't back in with the ecology effort and uh and the and the
 	
 	
 		yeah and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> i bet i have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> curling irons up there that have burned up you know that i won't throw away i won't get them fixed either though you know
 	
 	
 		oh i yeah
 		i know those i mean those things are so cheap but i mean like we have a vacuum that i got when i got married like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirteen years ago</TIMEX> and it
 		it was in real bad shape <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about five years ago</TIMEX> and i've had it overhauled for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> eighty dollars i guess and i could have bought a new one for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ninety five</NUMEX> but it still works
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah but
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		well i have a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kirby</ENAMEX>'s an old Kirby i've had for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about um ten fifteen years</TIMEX> and i i'm like you i've spent eighty <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">six dollars</NUMEX> on it <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> i keep having it you just redone and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yep
 		yeah
 		i think that's better though you know to do
 	
 	
 		i do too and it's just as good a vacuum cleaner as
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		because those things cost well well you know what the price of new Kirby vacuum cleaners are now
 	
 	
 		no huh-uh
 	
 	
 		just the basic without an any of the attachments or anything i think is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixteen hundred</TIMEX> dollars i said my gosh it has to come out and clean my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> by itself and serve me dinner before i'd pay sixteen <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">hundred dollars</NUMEX> and that's without the uh you know i
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh no
 		but yeah i wouldn't spend that much
 		everything on it
 	
 	
 		i couldn't believe it
 	
 	
 		no that's wild but boy but
 	
 	
 		they're good and vacuums not that good
 	
 	
 		jeez no
 	
 	
 		i just i had a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> come out and give me uh a demonstration on a new one and i
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		golly of course he made me look like now i keep a real clean <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> but by the time he got through with me with that new vacuum cleaner made me look like a you know filthy mess you know he was sucking dead uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		oh no
 		hey listen for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixteen</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">hundred dollars</NUMEX> you just save that and put it in the bank you'd get new carpet in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of years</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		i know
 		yeah just throw your carpet away well he was sucking uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know dead skin off of through the mattress you know went from the comforter through the sheet
 	
 	
 		oh you don't
 	
 	
 		and and he was showing me all this dead skin that you shed during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the night</TIMEX> and i said oh my God horrible i know it
 	
 	
 		you don't want to oh yuck that's gross i don't even want to i don't want to know about that
 	
 	
 		uh
 		i don't either if i'm shedding then i don't want to know about it as long as i don't can't see i well i let a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> talk me into uh
 		a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water softener</ENAMEX> when i <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> moved out here <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a twenty six</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">hundred dollars</NUMEX> we i just panicked after well he kind of scared me he just was really uh coming on strong and he just almost threatening me and he stayed until <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about ten o'clock at night</TIMEX> and course
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 		yeah yeah
 		yeah
 		you couldn't get rid of him
 	
 	
 		no and i'm not married and i think he and i let let it out that i wasn't and he was a big old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> and i thought oh God that was stupid i should have told him i had a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> but i didn't anyway <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next day</TIMEX> i had this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> that works for me call and tell him that i was cancel because you had that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three day</TIMEX> cooling down period here
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and so i canceled out of it
 	
 	
 		good oh good i know that is scary i just don't i won't talk to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> i mean i just tell them i am not interested i don't want anything you're selling go away
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh
 		and it yeah i don't care if i'm rude i just that's what i do anymore i just i'm not interested and if they call me on the phone i'm not interested just clunk up
 	
 	
 		yep yeah
 		you know i just read about here's another thing that you can buy  it just read about it in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> today you can get this attachment for your answering machine
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and what it is is it's like a little coder box and you tell all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that you want to talk to like your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> and your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> and stuff a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> digit code
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		and anybody who doesn't have it has to leave an answering answer on a message on the answering machine so if you get somebody trying to sell you something they can leave their little message but if it's your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> or somebody they can punch in their code
 	
 	
 		oh
 		yeah
 		wow yeah
 	
 	
 		course it costs a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">hundred dollars</NUMEX>  <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year two years from now</TIMEX> it'll be fifty i think i'll wait
 	
 	
 		oh naturally  naturally yeah
 		yeah right it probably i'll wait and it'll come down to twelve dollars you know about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five years</TIMEX>  well that's good
 	
 	
 		right right  yeah that might be come in handy if things keep getting as bad as they do and stuff
 	
 	
 		yeah i always hated answering machines until i got mine
 	
 	
 		i do i i still don't like them i don't like them very much i think yeah
 	
 	
 		i don't either i have it but i don't like it it was given to me and i feel like i have to use and it's come in handy i've had some messages i like but i almost refuse to leave messages and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> i said well i called you and she said well i didn't get a message i said i didn't leave one
 	
 	
 		yep
 		yeah
 		yeah i know i don't like to leave them that much
 	
 	
 		that's the way of answering machines i thought
 		i don't i feel dumb talking to a machine for some reason
 	
 	
 		i know well of course
 		but i i know i the thing is though when you have an answering machine then you have to call everybody back if you don't have one then they have to call you  i just i just was out <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this afternoon</TIMEX> and i came in and i listened to answering machine and i had a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> that called
 	
 	
 		that's right  then you know that you
 	
 	
 		and not <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five minutes</TIMEX> went by and she called again and she said well didn't you get my message on the machine or do you just not want to talk to me
 	
 	
 		see i know yeah you're right you almost
 	
 	
 		and i was like well i just sat down  you know
 	
 	
 		i know i just got in or i have had i've told them i said  well no i didn't get it i guess the machine wasn't working or something like that
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i know
 	
 	
 		but other than that you know i'm lying  and i know it
 	
 	
 		yeah they don't believe you
 	
 	
 		i haven't had to take any of those back um
 	
 	
 		no i i don't know whether um
 	
 	
 		i think that's about the last time well that was a gift to me so i guess that's
 	
 	
 		yeah i think we just we haven't bought that much stuff lately but and
 	
 	
 		i think we all probably all have all the toys now
 	
 	
 		yep
 	
 	
 		there aren't any toys out there that we don't need so that's why we haven't bought anything as soon as something new comes out well probably i i guess everybody i know has got
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		you know VCR's and answering machines and portable phones and i don't have a car phone but i don't think i hate that i i get mad when i drive up and somebody's talking on the phone i think they're not driving safely did you know in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX> that's against the law to drive and talk on telephone
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		oh please my goodness
 		yep
 		wow
 	
 	
 		and i think it ought to be he
 	
 	
 		sounds
