 
     		
 	
 		well as much as i'd uh i'd like to say that i'll be looking for a flashy convertible or a or a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> or something i guess the next <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> i'll be looking for is a kind of a plain old four door
 	
 	
 		what kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> do you have now
 	
 	
 		oh we've got a uh an older <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta Eighty Eight</ENAMEX> and then uh our our newer <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> is a uh a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Corsica</ENAMEX> and uh we'll probably be looking for something about that uh that same style that same kind of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> door hard top style and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		you got kids
 	
 	
 		uh no but we're planning for it so uh in fact uh our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oldsmobile</ENAMEX> is a is a like an old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta Eighty Eight</ENAMEX> but it's in pretty good shape it's in really good shape and we've been really pleased with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oldsmobiles</ENAMEX> that's probably where the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> place we'd look
 	
 	
 		okay
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		huh
 	
 	
 		but uh
 	
 	
 		well we've always had uh Fords uh mostly because my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>'s stepfather works at a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> dealership
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		that'll do it
 	
 	
 		yeah that'll do it um but yeah we're we're in the same shape i think our next <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> will be a you know some big old four door  uh
 		something that can haul the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">baseball</ENAMEX> practice and piano lessons and  we've got a minivan
 	
 	
 		yep
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and that's great
 		and i drive i drive uh well i used to drive an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Escort</ENAMEX> but it died on me so i  i mean i i i used to run it i uh where we used to live i used to commute <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">forty miles</NUMEX> a day
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh jeez
 	
 	
 		and uh and this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Escort</ENAMEX> took it all and its it it got up to uh uh i was at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ninety four</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">thousand miles</NUMEX> on it and the engine just went
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so i i bought i bought a used um <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dodge</ENAMEX> Aries
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		which has been okay i i mean i haven't had it that long but  it it'll it's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an eighty five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Aries</ENAMEX> but it only had thirty <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">four thousand miles</NUMEX> on it when i bought it
 	
 	
 		really
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		oh jeez
 	
 	
 		and i just you know i just drive it to work so it's just a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">ten minute</TIMEX> commute everyday
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so um it doesn't get much of uh i mean  it's not like i'm putting it through its paces  but i think uh and it's a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> door which is nice but it's still a little cramped i've got <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah yeah sounds like you you need at least like a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Taurus</ENAMEX> size or something like that
 	
 	
 		so i i
 		yeah that's what i was thinking of was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Taurus</ENAMEX> um
 	
 	
 		yeah i i know i know a lot of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> at work they uh the ones that have uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> uh and they still want kind of a sports <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> they've been uh a lot of them been getting these uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Taurus</ENAMEX> SHOs
 		that i guess it's the sport version of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Taurus</ENAMEX> in fact it comes with a standard stick and uh
 	
 	
 		oh really  yeah
 		ooh
 	
 	
 		and a lot of those it comes with a bigger engine and the things like that but uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and usually they're in like black and gun <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">metal grey</ENAMEX> and and those kind of colors you're not gonna see too many uh you know green ones or blue ones or anything like that they they put them in sporty colors i guess but uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		yeah well my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> wants a Miata
 	
 	
 		oh well sure  that's what you know until till you look at the price tag and then you go what what would i really besides tooling around and looking really cool and having a lot of fun what would i really do with this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> if it what
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right
 		right yeah
 		i know i know it's like i i guess i could fit in it  maybe
 	
 	
 		yeah i
 		i went i went through that when i <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> got out of uh college i had an old <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> that i bought just to get to to my job my <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> job
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and when i got there the first thing i did was trade it in on a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spitfire</ENAMEX> and i i knew that was gonna be the only time i could afford a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> seater uh sports car
 	
 	
 		no
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but that that just does not make it as an only <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> it's uh it's like i bought i would i bought a set of stereo speakers
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and it was one of those cash and carry deals and i had to take them one at a time with the top down
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and it was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> so i was like in this coat with the top down and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passenger</ENAMEX> seat
 	
 	
 		oh no
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and i drove that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> home and then i went back and got the other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> and put that in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passenger</ENAMEX> seat and drove that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> home
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and uh funny funniest sight and  you kind of outgrow that real quick when it's your only car
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah well i you know it's funny most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that i've talked to
 		did stuff like that when they were in college or you know  or when they were single anyway they'd they'd buy themselves a sporty <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> because it was their last i never did that uh you know my <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> was a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toyota</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Corolla</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		and uh because i got a good deal on it and uh that was a great little <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> actually
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i met that's how i met girls
 		was i'd find out if a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> could drive a manual transmission which i i'd never i i'd learned on an automatic transmission and so so i'd go out on dates where they would teach me how to drive this car
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> that's a good deal
 	
 	
 		and uh in fact i married one of those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and it worked yeah it worked all right real good
 	
 	
 		ah okay well i'll have to remember that if i ever get in that situation again
 		huh because i i know we've uh that's that's something that that we definitely have to go with is an automatic transmission my um my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> just does can't can't
 		can't uh  she doesn't really wanna learn i guess the uh the standard shift in fact i i remember once we uh
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		we uh went uh went on a uh test drive we got <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of these things from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee Iacocca</ENAMEX> that said you know i'll give you a fifty dollar savings bond if you'll test drive a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> and we went uh we went uh
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		we went to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">dealership</ENAMEX> and uh
 		it it was it was pretty she she did pretty well but it was one of these things where we just went to a big parking lot and the uh dealer kind of gave her standard shift parking because that's all it was it was it was the funniest thing it was like a
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		a big Le <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Baron</ENAMEX> it was a Le <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Baron</ENAMEX> with everything on it but it had a standard shift it was the craziest thing i ever saw and and and that's probably why they were trying to sell them i guess
 	
 	
 		wow
 		that's weird
 		yeah
 		huh
 	
 	
 		and uh we just kind of went back and forth and back and forth she did pretty well after a while but uh it's it's kind of hard to learn i guess
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> i mean she'd always driven standard transmission and uh and and in fact all our earlier <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> were standard a standard transmission in fact the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">minivan</ENAMEX>'s a has a stick shift
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		okay
 	
 	
 		and in fact this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dodge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Aries</ENAMEX> is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> car we've ever gotten that had anything you know it's got
 		automatic transmission cruise control you know electric locks you know it's like it's like a luxury car except that it's the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dodge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Aries</ENAMEX> you know so uh
 	
 	
 		oh jeez
 		yeah yeah
 		what the oh well
 		well i guess that i guess that's about all i got to say about <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		well  um
 		the the thing about this uh the i will say this about the minivan
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		we thought that was a luxury <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> when we bought it it it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh i would think so yeah because it's so big
 	
 	
 		yeah and and it was quiet it had a stereo system we never had it you know we always had the AM radio  and uh course this had stick shift it had <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers speakers</ENAMEX> that you can control from the backseat
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		sure sure
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and you can change the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> on the on the radio from the backseat too and put <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker speaker</ENAMEX> phones in it so uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		now now now that used to be a luxury but i bet on the next time you buy a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> that's gonna be mandatory  you've got to have that now you're used to it and you got to have it
 	
 	
 		right
 		that's right that's right
 		and you got to pay for it too and i bet and i bet it costs twice as much as as when i bought mine
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true too
 		it  probably does it probably does
 		but uh
 		oh well well Bill it's been nice talking to you okay you have a good <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</TIMEX> um-hum bye-bye
