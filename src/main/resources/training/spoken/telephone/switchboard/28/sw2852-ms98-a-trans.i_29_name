 		hum-um no no
 		and just always you know always quiet and pleasant and
 	
 	
 		yeah they're uh i i found that if you call and make reservations oh i uh you they used to irritate me making us wait so long but uh now i found if i call and make reservations they usually get you in pretty fast so
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		oh the uh
 		uh one out here is just always very accommodating you know we like a lot of ethnic foods too we we like to go different places and

 		well i love <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> i love oriental food and i love <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seafood</ENAMEX> and uh
 		but i also like i i don't mind paying for atmosphere
 	
 	
 		yep yeah i don't either
 	
 	
 		i i
 		it doesn't bother me at all and uh if i
 		and i don't and i'm not opposed to tipping very well if i if the service is good but boy i it really irritates me to
 		well like in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cheddars</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> i know that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> just forgot our order and we were on a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">lunch hour</TIMEX> you know and my gosh she just
 	
 	
 		you waiting and waiting and waiting
 	
 	
 		and i know i thought gosh my whole <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">lunch hour</TIMEX> i'm just sitting here waiting here for a lousy sandwich
 		so i went ahead and tipped her but i didn't want to
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		was mad
 	
 	
 		yeah and you know that that's part of their wage and that they get busy and stuff you but but you wouldn't tip as much as you would have had
 	
 	
 		yes i know it
 		right yeah right but that that and i do i tip accordingly oh believe me i if the
 	
 	
 		you know the uh
 		i do too i think that that's service related and you know
 	
 	
 		i do too but i hate cheap <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that that get good service and don't tip that irritates me just as bad and i've been out with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> that have embarrassed me that don't tip
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		you know well i  it really uh
 	
 	
 		makes you want to just kind of slip a little more under there
 	
 	
 		yeah it really and i have i have slipped money you know if if the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> didn't tip enough i'll take money out of my purse but a
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		and i hope it makes them feel bad but i don't think it does
 	
 	
 		no probably not they figure i guess they figure that's your choice well
 		uh i know uh my i have teenagers
 		and just recently i was out with a group of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teenagers</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">semester</TIMEX> exams
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh if i said i would provide transportation at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">lunchtime</TIMEX> for them to go and
 		out to eat and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so all these little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> here they all want their own tickets you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i said right up front now <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> actually i kind of said it to my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> and if i was going to do it again i would say it to the whole <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> because
 		i was too uh i was i was too shy i didn't not too shy i just didn't want to embarrass her
 	
 	
 		okay
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but what happened was i ended up having to loan money to those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> because they did not figure in the tip and the tax
 	
 	
 		oh did you really
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		they looked at that and said <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three ninety five</NUMEX> they say i got <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> dollars i can do this
 	
 	
 		and they thought that really
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		you know so they buy the get the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three ninety five</NUMEX> item and you know then they didn't have enough for the extra so
 	
 	
 		and i found the also that uh i don't think that waitresses
 		i yeah i was in a survey when i lived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Orlando</ENAMEX> uh had a was in a survey of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> and uh
 		the i a lot of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">waiters</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">waitresses</ENAMEX> think you know when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> come in that that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> are lousy tippers and that's why they don't give them as good a service as they do a couple or something like that but i don't think that's true i think women
 	
 	
 		just that you know a single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> of any kind is not going to have as large an order
 	
 	
 		to me
 		right
 	
 	
 		as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two or three</NUMEX> at a table
 	
 	
 		well i find that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> are more willing to give a good tip a bunch of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> as
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couples</ENAMEX> or or you know  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> together probably
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i don't think they're that but that they were on this survey they were saying that the
 		that's the notion that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> have i mean that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">waitress</ENAMEX> and waitresses had
 		but uh
 	
 	
 		well i i yeah i definitely disagree with that
 	
 	
 		i like one of my favorites in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> is uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baby Doe</ENAMEX>'s you have you ever eaten there
 	
 	
 		um-hum been a long time been a long time
 	
 	
 		oh
 		yeah i love it oh gosh it's i like the atmosphere i remember when they first opened up i we went several times
 		and uh it was it was so much fun but i like i said i like to go to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> like that i and i like these um
 		have you ever been to what
 		when i lived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Orlando</ENAMEX> they had call a place called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare</ENAMEX>'s and they probably have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> similar to it here where medieval
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		uh-huh the medieval
 	
 	
 		yeah those are kind of fun i wouldn't want a steady diet of it but
 	
 	
 		kind of uh a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tavern pub</ENAMEX> kind of thing
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and have the wenches wait on you
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it was a lot of fun i i enjoyed that
 	
 	
 		we uh
 		we were at the butcher <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX> in the West End here recently and that was sure neat it cook your own steak and those <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steaks</ENAMEX> were wonderful
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah where you cook your own steak yeah yeah
 		yeah weren't they i i've eaten there that was that's good but
 	
 	
 		it was uh i really enjoyed that
 	
 	
 		i remember back when that was just
 		old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">warehouses</ENAMEX> down there i couldn't believe when i moved back to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> how that had changed
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		exactly exactly same here i grew up in the area
 	
 	
 		yeah i remember i think <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spaghetti Warehouse</ENAMEX> was about the only thing down there for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> and years
 	
 	
 		some of my favorite ones have
 	
 	
 		i guess it kind of grew around it
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		i moved from in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eighty five</NUMEX> when i came back all that was uh built back up
 	
 	
 		had all been worked over
 	
 	
 		yeah and i thought you know <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Deep Ellum</ENAMEX> i still don't think i'd go to <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Deep Ellum</ENAMEX> i don't care how chic it's supposed to be but
 	
 	
 		well there's some wonderful little <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> and art
 		
 
 		art <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">galleries</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		is it really i just could i just from
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		back in the fifties i remember how bad it was and i just it just stuck in my mind and i just wouldn't go down there i don't think especially at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> i might during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> but i don't think i'd go at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> down there
 		at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">all</TIMEX>
 		because it used to really be rough and tough in fact the only time i ever saw anybody stabbed out we were driving down
 		in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> and saw a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> come out of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">theater</ENAMEX> with a knife sticking out of his back and that just is stuck in my mind and he was walking too uh they were walking him to an ambulance
 	
 	
 		ooh
 	
 	
 		and i just
 		i've never gone back since then
 	
 	
 		that was enough to take it
 	
 	
 		no  that's right
 		i don't want to go down there anymore
 	
 	
 		well i think that's
 		those kind of things definitely tend to mark your uh
 	
 	
 		yeah but <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> has really got a lot of good <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		they really do i think <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> is a very uh up and coming area i think it's uh
 	
 	
 		yeah they just
 	
 	
 		it it caters to a lot of business <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> and a lot of out of towners and and regulars also and you know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh yeah</ENAMEX>
 		are you a native Dallasite
 	
 	
 		uh i came here when i was in elementary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> so i consider myself native
 	
 	
 		okay
 		well i married a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dallasite</ENAMEX> and that's how i got here but i would you know i wouldn't trade for it i
 		i'm from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> but i
 		i just consider myself a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Texan</ENAMEX> when i moved to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> i couldn't hardly wait to get back
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		i stayed down there <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four years</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		i think uh you know that uh i think <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> is becoming diverse enough now to accommodate almost any need
 	
 	
 		yeah i think so
 	
 	
 		or any desires in any kind of cooking you know <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian Greek</ENAMEX> you name it you know there's there's something for everybody and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		i'm enjoying living over here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Grapevine</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fort Worth</ENAMEX> area too for for a change because
 		i'm really discovering <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fort Worth</ENAMEX> they've got a lot of nice <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> over here that a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> don't know about you know
 	
 	
 		our favorite one in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fort Worth</ENAMEX> is downtown <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fort Worth</ENAMEX> kind of across from the uh
 		The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Keg</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Keg</ENAMEX> is it down there by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sundance Square</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Keg</ENAMEX>
 		well it's down you know by the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Convention Center</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah i  i
 	
 	
 		i don't know what the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> is
 	
 	
 		i'm not real familiar with down there i've been down there to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sundance Square</ENAMEX> when i <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> uh moved back here i met my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister-in-law sister-in-law</ENAMEX> down there and uh
