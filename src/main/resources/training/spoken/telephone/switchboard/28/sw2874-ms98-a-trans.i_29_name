 		they have mostly small mouth in them or
 	
 	
 		no we have a quite actually quite a lot of variety here's uh there's we have large mouth small mouth um sort of musky pike stuff like that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know all sorts of fun stuff like that um
 		we have a pretty large <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bass masters</ENAMEX> tournament actually takes place right on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lake Ontario</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every year</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh yeah that's right uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so it's it's that's a lot of fun
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		how about you do you like what what do you like to go for
 	
 	
 		oh it's it's uh i <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> for bass but i hardly ever catch <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> but um
 		um they have a tail race over in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lake Lavon</ENAMEX> and uh you know they wash when they open up the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dam</ENAMEX> and let out <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> they wash down the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> and uh you catch that white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bass</ENAMEX> and crappie out of there
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um
 	
 	
 		every once in a while there'll be striped bass
 	
 	
 		we have uh some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> who live on a lake and it the lake it just seems is is completely filled with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bass</ENAMEX> to the point where you know normally you go you you go fishing for bass you get a lot of sunfish or
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		or cat or whatever and some other strange stuff but in this particular lake we went out with some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> once and we just every time you tossed the line in you pull up a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">five six seven inch</NUMEX> minimum bass and usually you pull up you know thirteen to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fourteen</NUMEX> inch bass
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		yeah it's a real it's a real enjoyable experience to go fishing there because we just we pull up you know bass after <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bass</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		during perch <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX> as well you pull up a lot of
 		uh probably during during perch season the perch will run in very large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> so what they'll do is just you'll you'll be sort of boating around these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> own a little row <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> and they'll be boating around and they'll hit a they'll hit a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> of perches in the middle
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and when they do you can just drop the lines in and just pull them in one at they they just drop it in they they can't pull it in fast enough
 	
 	
 		
 
 		what do you what do you catch perch on
 	
 	
 		um i they actually
 		they according to them you can catch when the perch are running you can catch them on just about anything
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		they tend to use i guess <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worms</ENAMEX> or some kind of lures sometimes but you know i've she told me that they will sometimes use <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">corn</ENAMEX> or anything you know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		they'll <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">corn</ENAMEX> or salami or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bread</ENAMEX> or anything they'll they'll they'll hit because they're just sort of surrounded these large schools
 	
 	
 		yeah it's sometimes i use <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">corn</ENAMEX> but uh uh some fish steal it off the hook sometimes
 	
 	
 		yeah it's a big problem
 	
 	
 		yeah um
 		the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">other day</TIMEX> i was fishing with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bread</ENAMEX> uh there's a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">college</ENAMEX> across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> and they it's it's full of carp
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh i caught a carp on a about what size is that uh i think it was a number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> treble hook and it's huge its its mouth was just full of hooks
 	
 	
 		um
 		wow
 	
 	
 		so he was in a bad way but uh it's he was fast
 	
 	
 		a big one
 	
 	
 		he's uh yeah well it's uh it was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">sixteen inches</NUMEX> long
 	
 	
 		wow that's that's that's a nice size carp
 	
 	
 		yeah i think it was about a pound and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a half</TIMEX> you know but all they're good for is the fight <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> they don't they really don't want to come out of the water they they zip through the water you know you're how your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">line</ENAMEX> goes you know
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i thought you know that uh i wasn't going to be able to get it in because uh the one i hooked <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">just about ten minutes before</TIMEX> when when i tried to raise it out of the water it fell off
 		so it wasn't hooked very well but you know i got it that far i figured that uh
 	
 	
 		that that that counts
 	
 	
 		yeah that's what i said that's what i told the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> was standing there and he laughed when it fell off  and i said that's a quick release right there
 	
 	
 		
 
 		do you do you do you actually like the taste of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> do you like eat the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> that you catch or are you more of a sport fisherman
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">um catfish yeah</ENAMEX> but uh i haven't eaten anything else you know
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		um there's some uh my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> has a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">farm</ENAMEX> and there's he has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> ponds up there and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">uncle</ENAMEX> has a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a pond</NUMEX> upstream and there's a lot of crappie in there now
 		but uh i think he's the only one that's that's caught enough crappie or a big enough crappie to eat but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">catfish</ENAMEX> there's you know there's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of them from like <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">six pounds</NUMEX> and
 	
 	
 		right so you can just
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		oh because i don't actually like <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> it's sort of so when i fish it's more for sport than anything else
 	
 	
 		yeah and if you know when you when you have to look in their eyes and you know hit them in the head or whatever that's what you do with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">catfish</ENAMEX> you know because you have to sever their spinal cord
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right
 		and and <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">and and</ENAMEX> and be careful you don't get stung
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah i know it have you ever tried uh deep sea fishing
 	
 	
 		uh not yet my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> went off the coast of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maine</ENAMEX> uh when the i don't know what they Mackerel that school out there it's he he said that it was just like that  they were throwing like uh uh hell benders or uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh some other kind of treble hook lure and and uh each time they bring them in they'd have at least one sometimes they've had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> on you know one on every hook
 	
 	
 		yeah we i was out in  <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> with a friend
 		a while ago and we would go and just uh drop <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> you know a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a two or three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rig</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two or three</NUMEX> hooked <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rig</ENAMEX> as well down off a boat we just dropped it down there and
 		the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">captain</ENAMEX> had you know some kind of sonar in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> so he'd maneuver us in into a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> and you just drop it in and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and it just you you get one or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> at a shot you know and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's a good deal too it was it was a like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty</TIMEX> dollars for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">six hours</TIMEX> of fishing on some big charter boat
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		you know and and and they'll clean your <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> on a tip basis for you if you want
 	
 	
 		yeah down here it's like <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">two hundred dollars</NUMEX> a day
 	
 	
 		well this is yeah this this this was for a you know large there were
 	
 	
 		a group party
