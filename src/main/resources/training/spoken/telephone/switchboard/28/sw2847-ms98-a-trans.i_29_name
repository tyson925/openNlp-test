 
     		
 	
 		
 
 		tell me what books you read
 	
 	
 		oh boy well um i haven't been doing a whole lot of reading for enjoyment lately i read uh one book a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> recommended to me i can't even remember the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX>'s name it was a science fiction <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dean</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cole</ENAMEX> or something like that and it was so frightening and it had so much violence in it i just  could hardly stand it yeah i didn't think it was so great she thought it was riveting you know but i couldn't deal with that but um
 	
 	
 		um i try to avoid the
 	
 	
 		mostly i read i'm a marriage and family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counselor</ENAMEX> and mostly i read things to do with raising <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> and now i have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> or codependency or you know fifty <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousand</NUMEX> things like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Bradshaw</ENAMEX>'s books on uh <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Family</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Homecoming and Inner Child</ENAMEX> and so i read usually that kind of stuff if and right now i'm reading um <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judith Viorst</ENAMEX>'s book called Necessary Losses where she talks about different losses that we've had in our lives that we have to get past if we're going to mature and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so in my in my spare time with a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two and a half</TIMEX> and a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three and a half year old</TIMEX> i i read  yes that's really changed my reading habits because i used to read so much especially when i was in school
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that does cut into your reading time a lot
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know but gosh it's uh it's getting pathetic now if i get through a magazine i've been
 	
 	
 		well my my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> are up and out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX> now so you know i'll uh encourage you that you do get uh a little more time to yourself later on  i won't say lots
 	
 	
 		yeah later you're probably looking for your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> so you can  talk to them when they're out running around with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>  yeah what do you read
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		oh uh well i read for a living uh i'm an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you do oh oh how interesting what kind of books
 	
 	
 		and so i i'm at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center for Advanced Study</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Behavioral Sciences</ENAMEX> and therefore i read uh psychology sociology anthropology political science philosophy linguistics history uh
 	
 	
 		um
 		oh my goodness
 	
 	
 		yeah and you name it i've read some of it
 	
 	
 		yeah well that sounds like a fascinating job
 	
 	
 		it really is it it's a great place to be and the uh it's nice to work with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> uh who
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		are not required to use your services and so therefore are grateful and not arguing you with you about them if they don't want an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> they don't come
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that's true that's true well you probably i i seem to remember that uh little byline on a lot of things i've read um is is is that um do they have a mail
 	
 	
 		
 
 		hum
 	
 	
 		kind of campaign that they send to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX> in the social no
 	
 	
 		no we don't uh normally we don't publish uh things under our own imprint uh
 	
 	
 		hum that sounds so familiar
 	
 	
 		we have had books that are written here that are then published by all sorts of different uh commercial and academic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publishers</ENAMEX> and university presses
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so uh i end up sometimes reading the things that are written here all the way through sometimes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">just a few</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapters</ENAMEX> because that's as far as they get
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but i also get of course lots of references to neat stuff to read about
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so i'm uh i was just thinking when they told me the topic i should just i should read the uh titles of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> books that are sitting on my desk right now that i'm in the middle of
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i'm reading uh Within the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Plantation</ENAMEX> Household which is a history uh sort of a sociological history of southern <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> black and white living on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plantations</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh that sounds interesting yeah
 	
 	
 		uh a book called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Poisons</ENAMEX> of the Past which is about ergotisms that uh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fungus</ENAMEX> that grows on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rye</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		it causes the uh uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint Anthony's Fire Disease</ENAMEX> where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> fell into fits and
 	
 	
 		i thought that was going to be some
 		oh
 		oh my goodness
 	
 	
 		there is a a theory at least that a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who were accused of witchcraft were actually under the influence of ergot
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		and a book called <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Job Cues Gender Cues</ENAMEX> which explains
 		uh how certain professions and vocations get uh flip flopped from one gender predominance to the other like uh nursing
 	
 	
 		um-hum nursing or
 	
 	
 		started out all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and then in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the nineteenth century</TIMEX> began to have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> and now it's practically all women
 	
 	
 		yeah <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretaries</ENAMEX> i bet that used to be mostly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> who were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretaries</ENAMEX> of any type for business
 	
 	
 		and that uh
 		that's right and the thing that changed that was the manual typewriter
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh
 	
 	
 		but then it became you see just sort of a clerical task whereas when you wrote it out in long hand you were a
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		then you were important
 	
 	
 		yes you were a confidential assistant to the person
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah like the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scribes</ENAMEX> who did the old documents you know for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and stuff yeah that's interesting
 	
 	
 		and then i've got a book called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fashions</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Science</ENAMEX> which is a sociology that explains uh why certain theories get to be popular in uh sociology and
 		uh how difficult it is to swim against the tide if you have a different idea that isn't vatted by your peers
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and then i have one novel that's called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">First Light</ENAMEX> that's about uh archeology
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> novel so it's it's really quite interesting i haven't got too far into it yet
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gosh</ENAMEX> really
 		so are you reading these in the form of just like printed manuscripts that have not been published
 	
 	
 		uh those are all books that are out uh published and bound now but they're just things that
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> pertain to various things i'm working on or were uh mentioned prominently and attracted my curiosity so i got them out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> and decided i'd read some more in them
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		my goodness well that's fascinating gosh
 	
 	
 		so i read a lot of history and uh a few novels an occasional mystery stories just for fun
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah yeah i never have gotten into any of the romantic novels or any of that kind of stuff my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> reads a lot of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">um well</ENAMEX> he did before we had <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Star Trek</ENAMEX> and all those kind of sci-fi kinds of things you know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		oh yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		you really he's got a quite a collection of those but uh
 		my stuff revolves uh revolves revolves around uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one hundred one thousand</NUMEX> let's see i've got one called <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">One Thousands Practical Parenting Tips</ENAMEX> which teaches you to put elastic instead of shoelaces in your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX>'s shoes hey i've done that to every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> my <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three year old</TIMEX> has
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh hey that's a nifty idea
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">great</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know really and uh
 	
 	
 		oh i think the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the boom</TIMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> and the the shoelace <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> was those little <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Velcro</ENAMEX> tabs i think that's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inc</ENAMEX> redibly
 	
 	
 		oh yeah yeah but there's a surprising number that are still around that aren't that don't have those so that's an alternate means of dealing with  but um i'm trying to think of what else i've got uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		since i'm um a therapist and all i've done recently a lot of research into some of the twelve step <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> so i've got all the different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alcoholics</ENAMEX> what they call the blue the blue book the big book
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and all the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OA</ENAMEX> literature and all the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CODA</ENAMEX> literature so i'm trying to get familiarized more familiarized with that because i refer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> and different <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> and uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		well let's see i'm trying to think of the
 	
 	
 		what do you think is the most promising or practical book uh of that kind yo u've read recently
 	
 	
 		um oh i definitely i have a a love affair with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Bradshaw</ENAMEX> i just have found everything i've read of his to be fabulous
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		um he started out with one called <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Family</ENAMEX> which does the family systems and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>'s roles in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> and then he did uh <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Healing Healing the Shame that Binds You</ENAMEX>
 		about how shame can just be so paralyzing and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> isolate and withdraw and then the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> one that he came out with is now called <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Homecoming</ENAMEX> uh and uh there's a subtitle to it i never can remember what it is it's something like um <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A Journey</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		In <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Your Inner Child</ENAMEX> or something like that
 	
 	
 		yeah i knew his literary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Houston</ENAMEX> when she was just uh convincing him to write all this down he was teaching
 	
 	
 		oh he's just great and now he's had the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the first the first one</TIMEX> and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> one put into a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> session uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> series
 	
 	
 		yeah i saw i saw <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of those episodes on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> uh from time to time out here we have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> different <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> channels that we can get on the cable
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and they'll have all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> of those shown back to back in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the middle of the night</TIMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> can video tape them
 	
 	
 		i know yeah so <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> can just tape them i guess you know  but i definitely have gotten a lot out of his lately he's just probably been one of the most there's an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> that's in um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that's in uh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arizona</ENAMEX> who used to be in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> it seems like we have a lot of these that have been in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PM Melody</ENAMEX> who does a lot of writing on codependency and she's got some fabulous workbooks out and a whole series of tapes and uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		hm
 	
 	
 		a workbook called <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Breaking Free</ENAMEX> and just some real uh helpful practical things for codependency so that's been another one that i've thought was real helpful but
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		other than that uh my reading <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Paddington Bear and  Winnie the Pooh and  Doctor</ENAMEX> Seuss
 	
 	
 		oh yes  oh
 	
 	
 		but i really have enjoyed exploring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>'s literature because there's so much more uh new things out that you know i i'd pull out the classics once in a while for my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> but there's such cute things out for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh there's some absolutely wonderful illustrated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>'s books
 	
 	
 		oh i know and i just go to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> because i just they're expensive i mean it and they go through them so fast you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so i just i really have been going to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> and getting my <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> books out and they just love to sit and read and now finally the littlest one is old enough to to sit you know and watch the pictures instead of grabbing it and trying to rip the pages out
 	
 	
 		exactly right uh well
 	
 	
 		so that has been fun to do that you know go through the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>'s literature and uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i read the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Publisher</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Weekly</ENAMEX> uh which lists all the upcoming books forthcoming books and uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		there are so many that look like they would just be absolutely wonderful but i was tickled to see that some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">publisher</ENAMEX> is uh reprinting those the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Thurber</ENAMEX> books for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh wonderful
 	
 	
 		the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Wonderful O and The Thirteen Clocks</ENAMEX> that have been out of print for about oh i think about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty years</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gosh</ENAMEX> really well i'm going to have to look for those yeah
 	
 	
 		well i had those for my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> and they really did enjoy them
 	
 	
 		oh
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		oh but they were old copies then i didn't buy them when my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> were little and so they probably were out of print all of already when my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> were small but
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		um i was really happy to see that yeah i guess it's in honor of his hundredth
