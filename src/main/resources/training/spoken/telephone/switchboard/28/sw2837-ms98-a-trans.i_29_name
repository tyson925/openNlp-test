 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		are you going to tell me what you've been doing lately in the okay
 	
 	
 		sure uh i'll offer anything that i can on the subject uh my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> and i just bought a just moved here recently and uh we bought uh this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX> about uh i don't know year and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a half ago</TIMEX>
 		what we have here now is just a basic three <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedroom</ENAMEX> two bath brick <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> which is uh completely different from what i had had before when i was working and before i married uh i lived in a little town
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">south</ENAMEX> of here that is just full  of old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> and uh historic old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> and things like that so i uh tried to i was in the process of renovating a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and uh that was about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seventy five years old</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh my
 	
 	
 		so um it had to have everything done from top to bottom to having it leveled jacked up um new plumbing new wiring
 		wallpaper paint everything you can think of that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX> had to have
 	
 	
 		you
 		uh you are experienced i would say
 	
 	
 		well i i really did enjoy it uh you know it was amazing what i found out i could do on my own if i just put my mind to it yeah
 	
 	
 		well i agree i have done done something uh like that too only not nearly nearly as extensive
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but it must be interesting now trying to do something to a basic ranch style home uh after having a
 	
 	
 		it is it is yeah
 	
 	
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> that was historical looking
 	
 	
 		that's that's true when uh i met my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> he was living in an <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> at the time and and uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> that i was living in <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only about eighty miles</NUMEX> from here
 		so um you know i we really it was just the market was so good we hadn't really planned on buying and as you probably heard from the in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> area period
 		the housing market is just unreal i mean you can get things for such a song
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		so that's that's really why we ended up in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX> like this his is not what we you know what we want to stay in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">forever</TIMEX> because i have to have my i've found that after doing this other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX> i have to have my hands into stuff and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know i'm always just wanting to paint and and wallpaper and redo and redo so um you know i i'm ready to get ahold of another one that i can have a little more input into  so
 	
 	
 		well maybe you can uh make that one charming and and make a little bit money uh
 	
 	
 		yeah that's that's the key you know the thing is uh when we moved in they had just
 		um painted wallpapered we're you know wallpapered new carpet and everything so i feel sort of um you know like it's sort of defeating my purpose to go rip everything out now and do it over just because i'm in the mood to do it
 		so uh we'll see we'll see how much longer we're here
 	
 	
 		yes
 		well we just moved to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Charlotte</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Enid Oklahoma</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um-hum oh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oklahoma</ENAMEX> of all places
 	
 	
 		so i know of what you're talking about as far as the market was concerned and i'll tell you uh we we had kind of a charming <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> it was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">cedar</ENAMEX> shake <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and very weathered and
 	
 	
 		yeah uh-huh right
 		oh yes uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh it was about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fifty years old</TIMEX> but not traditional not really uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		traditional looking particularly
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh so i tried to make it after i sold my business i in in i spent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">almost three years</TIMEX> redoing
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and i considered it a full time job
 	
 	
 		oh it is yeah
 	
 	
 		and when we did uh we kind of had planned this uh trek to the east because we're both originally from this part of the country
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		i see uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and so i think some of the things that i did paid off for instance one thing that i did that might even be a good suggestion for you uh was something i did on the outside i love old estate estate sales
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yes yes
 	
 	
 		i happened to go to just a little estate sale that just a little white frame <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> where the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> uh was very old and had gone into nursing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		uh all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> started going down to the barn
 		and so i thought well shoot i'm going to
 	
 	
 		huh oh
 		that's where i need to go
 	
 	
 		yes i'm going to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">barn</ENAMEX> too
 	
 	
 		exactly
 	
 	
 		they uh auctioned some tools and things like that but then they went over and started uh
 	
 	
 		yeah uh-huh
 	
 	
 		auctioning this big stack of bricks
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and so well i thought gee i've been wanting to do some brick uh walkways for a time
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		work right right uh-huh
 	
 	
 		anyway it ended up after some pretty uh heavy bidding that i got all those bricks for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">forty dollars</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		oh my word
 	
 	
 		and so my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> and i loaded bricks in his <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pickup truck</ENAMEX> for days
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh no oh my word
 	
 	
 		but what we ended up with was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about four thousand</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">forty dollars</NUMEX> oh my
 	
 	
 		for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">forty dollars</NUMEX>
 		and so what we did we had built a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">deck</ENAMEX> on the back of that <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> but it needed and it was quite large out to into the yard but on either side of it to the ends of the house
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		something uh-huh um-hum
 	
 	
 		it just needed to be all tied together so we made brick patios
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and walkways
 	
 	
 		oh how fun
 		oh how nice
 	
 	
 		and so for and he he did the digging which was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about six inches</NUMEX> but i figured the sand and all had that delivered and leveled it and and placed most all the bricks
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		uh-huh right
 		right
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and it turned out beautifully
 	
 	
 		oh i bet and what satisfaction to know that you did it in such an inexpensive way
 	
 	
 		yes well it nearly killed me
 	
 	
 		yeah but but you did stagger stagger back and say oh doesn't this look nice
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i hated to leave it
 	
 	
 		well let me ask you when you laid those bricks i know my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> bought a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX> about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten years ago</TIMEX> they're fixing to sell it again but and move again they're kind of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mom</ENAMEX>'s like i am she's a renovator a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lover</ENAMEX> of old things
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and you know they have to be doing something constantly and the patio that came with that house um
 		was not laid on a like i don't know if you can put some sort of a plastic sheeting or something under uh on top of the sand and then lay the bricks but they have they have a problem with these little tiny like sand bugs or something
 	
 	
 		no we
 		well i
 	
 	
 		that drill in between all these bricks and of course you know you have the uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">weeds</ENAMEX> that come up in between the bricks or and things like that
 	
 	
 		well no i i didn't have that trouble because um
 		we laid the i did get some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">material</ENAMEX>  and studied every bit of material that i could study but we laid those bricks about as close as you can get them because when you start and we put them on a base of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">four inches</NUMEX> of sand sand
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 		i see
 		oh okay yeah
 	
 	
 		and then we uh we swept <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sand</ENAMEX> in between but but it was an error to to leave like <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an eighth</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">an inch</NUMEX> or whatever you just put them together as close as you can
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		as tight as you can that's probably because they had you know every spring my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mom</ENAMEX> says we're going to have a party a barbecue and tell everybody guess what we're going to we're going to redo the patio you know we're going to pull up all the bricks but uh they just they j ust haven't brought themselves to do it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah well and i also used a rubber hammer a lot to um you know if it wasn't quite level or something i'd just get that rubber hammer and um
 	
 	
 		so
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		right
 	
 	
 		and and probably you know i think that they could if they have problems with uh sand bugs of some kind i think all they need to do is probably put some insecticide down in there on a
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		oh a fairly regular basis for a while anyway
 	
 	
 		right
 		right well the thing that's funny is they've done uh they've done things like that you know i'll catch her out there spraying around and then it's like
 		in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two days</TIMEX> time she they'll come home from work and those little things are back it's just they're the most resilient little characters
 		and so i don't know what they're finally going to do she may just hopefully they'll sell the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and go somewhere else and then she won't have to worry about it
 	
 	
 		well i think she i think she needs to take them to the extension <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> and ask him what they are and
 	
 	
 		what are these things
 	
 	
 		yeah is it Diazinon or what is it that will uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dursban</ENAMEX> or something like that
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah what it what it is that'll that'll take care of them
 	
 	
 		Dursban i think in this area or most all areas they use you know for ticks and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fleas</ENAMEX> and you know they're awful hard to do anything with
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right
 		oh that's true that's true but my my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dad farms</ENAMEX> and you know she's always telling him isn't there something that that you can bring <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> with you that kills everything that you spray you know out in the out in the field that you can get rid of these bugs but
 	
 	
 		yeah i bet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dursban</ENAMEX> would do it
 	
 	
 		um it might it might do it yeah she's got so many flower she's got just a gorgeous yard so many um <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> and her her <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> you know so she's sort of uh
 		real funny about what she sprays
 	
 	
 		yeah i think uh you probably just need to make sure that it dries very very carefully uh well before she lets her <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> out or something like that
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		well gosh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deb</ENAMEX> we could talk <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all day</TIMEX> couldn't we
 	
 	
 		i know i i was just you know it just seems like i as i said when i heard the what the subject was i thought oh gosh i haven't thought about uh what i went through at that other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> in so long i've been so busy
 		but uh i don't know of everything that i did i guess i enjoyed probably wallpapering the most and i thought that would be the hardest thing to do but um gosh you know i ended up wallpapering every <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedroom</ENAMEX> in that house
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		um up up the stairway even you know i just had a ball with it it was so much fun yeah and i've sworn up and down my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mom</ENAMEX>'s um
 	
 	
 		wow
 		oh oh good
 	
 	
 		my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mom</ENAMEX>'s great <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandparents</ENAMEX> had this huge <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Victorian</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris Texas</ENAMEX>
 		and the one thing that she ended up with is was the old door that was that was on the front door of that house
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yes
 	
 	
 		and she has that up in her <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">attic</ENAMEX> and i have sworn that it i'm going to find a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> to put that door on before she does so as far as looking toward the future
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know that's my plan i'm going to have to move fast i think though because um you know as i said
