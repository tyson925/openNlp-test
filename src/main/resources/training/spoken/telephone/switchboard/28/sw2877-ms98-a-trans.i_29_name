 		and that's a male and i have a wonderful female lab black lab
 	
 	
 		uh-huh how long have you had them
 	
 	
 		quite <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a long time</TIMEX> uh
 		probably <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five or six years</TIMEX> and unfortunately the black <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lab</ENAMEX> that's a female it that it's it's the most wonderful animal we've ever had an i when she was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about three years old</TIMEX>
 		we noticed that she was having problems uh problems limping and so forth and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		she has hip dysplasia
 	
 	
 		oh no
 	
 	
 		and it's in that breed
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but now i think there are tests that can be conducted uh
 		to
 		tell whether or not
 		the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">puppies</ENAMEX> have the have it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but i think i don't know apparently they've been so in well i don't know inbred or what but
 	
 	
 		oh is that right
 	
 	
 		well no i'm not sure that's the situation but it um for those <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> that are registered and if if you should have one
 		uh that also has hip dysplasia you cannot breed it uh
 	
 	
 		huh i had no idea i hadn't didn't even know that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh but she's wonderful
 	
 	
 		um our dog <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joey</ENAMEX> has uh a back problem
 	
 	
 		um like have
 	
 	
 		uh he he's got a bad back
 		but he's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> uh i guess he's about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">almost eight years old</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		what are the
 		what are the symptoms
 	
 	
 		um he just uh he doesn't
 		he uh you he rolls over he doesn't like to roll over
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um even you just when you touch him a certain way on the back
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		but otherwise he can jump uh you know just as long as he doesn't bend a certain way
 	
 	
 		um
 		well uh i have had just wonderful luck with this lab uh
 		when i uh let's see <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> before last
 		we would bring her in and uh when it was cold
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and she wouldn't i you know the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">next morning</TIMEX> you want to take them out
 		and she wouldn't i couldn't get her up without
 		picking picking her up and which it was pretty hard to do at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eighty</NUMEX> pounds
 	
 	
 		i bet
 	
 	
 		um until if i allowed her to not get up on her own it'd be <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two o'clock in the afternoon</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		anyway i uh met my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX>'s uh college <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">roommate</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vet</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and he said um let's give her some race horse shots
 		and you know in i'm i'm kind of glad to be able to tell people about this but you because you all the time you know run into <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with problems
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		anyway that's when we lived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oklahoma</ENAMEX> and uh
 		so he gave this <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> a series of  it's they give it to race horses uh to get rid of uh cartilage
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and it's called  anyway it's a series of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> shots once a week and then i noticed after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> shots she was
 	
 	
 		do you have to give those
 	
 	
 		well i could have but i can't give a shot
 	
 	
 		oh i believe me i understand
 	
 	
 		i took her from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Enid Oklahoma</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oklahoma City</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every week</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six weeks</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		and uh after the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">the second</NUMEX> shot she was significantly better then i didn't notice any improvement till the after the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">sixth</NUMEX> one
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and ever since and he said uh a booster uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every year</TIMEX> or two
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i mean maybe <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every six months</TIMEX> or or something like that and when i notice in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the winter</TIMEX> when it's worse you know it's cold weather and so forth
 		then i have uh gotten a booster for her but not many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in this part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> know anything about
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		i've had to get it from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oklahoma</ENAMEX> they've heard about it but they've really never used it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah i've never heard anything about it either
 	
 	
 		so <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> that get down in the hips like i think <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Shepherds</ENAMEX> do it and probably large dogs
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh it's just wonderful
 	
 	
 		does he get is he an inside <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> also or does he just run out in the backyard is he fenced in
 	
 	
 		uh
 		um um well we're living now in an area where we we we're in the woods and we take walks i just don't let them

 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
