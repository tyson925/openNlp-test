 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i guess i'm calling to tell you about my exercise program which is a little bit lacking right now i've slacked off in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last six months</TIMEX> but for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several years</TIMEX> i have walked <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">three miles</NUMEX> a day
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		okay i'm a walker also um-hum
 	
 	
 		are you uh and that my walking was a fast walk uh to get the heart rate up to an aerobic level
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and i in fact i was enjoying it so much uh that i was doing it like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven days a week</TIMEX> and i i pretty much had to cut that back though to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh boy
 		how far could you how far did you walk i mean um i know time wise you need at least <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty minutes</TIMEX> how many miles a day
 	
 	
 		uh i well it was <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about three</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about three</NUMEX> okay
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum and i walked <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> i did the uh slow walk kind of a normal walk for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> and the aerobic walk for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty</TIMEX> and cool down walk for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the last five</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		oh okay
 		oh yeah okay
 	
 	
 		but and and it was i was it was so much fun to watch the progress because
 		as i uh went along when i started uh at first i had to uh i didn't have to use my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX> all that much to uh you know get the heart rate up but then after about uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four weeks</TIMEX> then i had to use them all the time and then i had to i found that i had to raise them above my head and kind of down my back to to get the heart rate up it was very progressive it was progressive
 	
 	
 		oh boy uh-huh
 		yeah i  that's that's is very quickly also
 	
 	
 		yeah i thought well now i guess probably <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six weeks</TIMEX> before i had to do my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX> the whole time the whole <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty minutes</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		um-hum  i see did you find that when you walked like after you you were getting this aerobic uh benefits did not just the heart rate but did you see a difference in in your <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> also
 	
 	
 		oh my gosh yes i have the cutest turned up tail you ever saw  no no i did notice uh  a lot of difference
 	
 	
 		oh is that right
 		yeah okay
 		yeah the reason i ask is i've always really enjoyed walking and i know um you know i i it doesn't bother me to take walks by myself i just
 		when i walk i just i i think i enjoy the scenery you know and i've always found it relaxing it's always something i've enjoyed doing
 		and for me i've found that as long as i try to take <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">almost everyday</TIMEX> at least say a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty minute</TIMEX> walk or <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a half an hour</TIMEX> walk maybe more if i can that it's really makes a difference in my weight control
 	
 	
 		oh gosh yes
 	
 	
 		um in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the winter months</TIMEX> well here you know i'm sure down there <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the winter</TIMEX>'s a little better than here but in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the winter months January and February</TIMEX> are
 		are the hard <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> and you have some really cold <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> and i don't walk much at all in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the winter</TIMEX> and i really you know i i gain a little bit of weight but i think
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know you really start to feel it as far as your clothes how you feel um and i i i was doing um
 		once in awhile floor aerobics uh i but i developed <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX> and and i had to give up the the floor aerobics for a while but walking is something that i continued to do
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and um i don't know i find for me that um it's just something that i never have gotten tired of whereas when i take an aerobics <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> by the end of the twelve <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX> i'm glad to uh finish it
 	
 	
 		well i think may be you like doing it alone you like doing it on your own time too
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah it's uh it's uh i i you know i know my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX> will go is very disciplined will get up <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">six o'clock in the morning</TIMEX> and and do rowing and aerobics tapes and i don't have that type of discipline but
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um i you know i found that it's not necessary really necessary to knock yourself out to that degree to keep fit and i really think walking is probably one of the best things because it's something if you live into your nineties you could continue to do
 	
 	
 		i think so to well and i i was very pleased uh when uh during cold weather and i haven't lived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Charlotte North Carolina</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a full year</TIMEX> yet but uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i see
 	
 	
 		when i lived in a colder climate i had access to one of those <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schwinn</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bicycles</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		the ones that you you know you have to use your <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX> also and so on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">those days</TIMEX> i did <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bike</ENAMEX> now that was a little boring because i did it alone
 	
 	
 		right
 		oh i see
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh with you know you can't read very very well if you're using your <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX> and uh
 		you can't put a book on that type of arms but that was i was very lucky there but here i have <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> that i take uh on long walks
 	
 	
 		right right right
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and that makes it a lot better to have their company
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but as i said i'm not doing quite it quite as well now because we're in a temporary situation and what i had uh also found that i guess it's like um certain addition um
 		once it well it it's easier to quit if you start uh
 		um stopping shall i say and if you skip <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">some days</TIMEX> then uh it's awfully hard to get back to a regular routine
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah i think that's true um you know i found that oh i used to be just a fanatic walker even when i was pregnant with with my <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> i i walked <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two three</NUMEX> times a day for
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes to half an hour</TIMEX> i must have walked <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about five minutes</TIMEX> a day and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and um and then um
 		when i well then i had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> and you know that makes it a little harder sometimes and then i was working and then when i i found when when i got arthritis one of the bad things about it that comes with it is is fatigue and
 	
 	
 		sure
 		um
 	
 	
 		and and i found that i was tiring very quickly and i couldn't walk like a used to but i saw a big difference in my figure yeah and um i'm just i'm i'm doing better because i'm under control using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX> so i'm getting back into
 	
 	
 		yes
 		yes yes
 	
 	
 		this walking everyday but it's really true once you haven't done it for a while it's very difficult to start back again but once you really are into it i was definitely addicted to walking i had to have my walk everyday
 	
 	
 		um-hum well and i well i had support from my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> too which was is very nice he felt that i needed to put that <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> and uh i don't believe a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> always have that kind of support
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah yeah no i yeah that's true i um um fortunate enough that he doesn't travel that much and that whenever as soon as he gets home from work or whatever i'll say after dinner well you know i'm i'm talking off for my walk you know
 	
 	
 		hum-um yes yes
 	
 	
 		and uh yeah that's that's true and you know i've i've had his support there to anytime i've taken a class aerobics in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the evening</TIMEX> or something you know we've always been able to work it out um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">hum-um</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but right now i'm taking water aerobics also and that's a little bit different it's it's more strenuous then i figured it would be um
 	
 	
 		then you thought yes i've had those and i think they're excellent
 	
 	
 		yeah i think so i've i've talk and now i'm only talking it <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day a week</TIMEX> some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> there take it <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two and three days a week</TIMEX> and they say that when you take it <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two or three days a week</TIMEX> you will see a difference
 	
 	
 		um-hum oh i'm sure oh my gosh yes i i think it's wonderful i've had it and on a regular basis and uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i found it a lot more fatiguing than my uh walking program in fact
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah i agree i agree there's something about being in the water and exercising and you come out and you have a big appetite
