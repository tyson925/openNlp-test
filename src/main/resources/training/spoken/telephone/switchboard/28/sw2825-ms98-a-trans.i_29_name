 
     		
 	
 		okay
 		okay now as you were saying
 	
 	
 		i said one thing we've been doing around here is trying to find ways of having uh
 		my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> likes gourmet food
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i'm trying to figure out how how to feed him so he'll eat this stuff  and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> will eat it too and it's not going to be fattening high in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fat</ENAMEX> or high in cholesterol
 		get's to be a a real chore with little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> who basically want every thing covered in cheese
 	
 	
 		right that's true um i have the same problem i've uh in fact both of us like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cheese</ENAMEX> uh my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> are grown now um and i also like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice cream</ENAMEX> so
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i just have been fortunate with that i have never really had an ice cream fetish but i'm married to somebody who just feels that you know if you offer it to him he'd eat a hot fudge <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sundae</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">every night</TIMEX> of the week
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and i hate him for it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah well
 		everyone has their own little things right his is <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice cream</ENAMEX> or hot fudge sundaes but i tell you what we use to do even when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> were growing up <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every Friday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		would be our night that um
 		uh put to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> to bed when they were younger and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> and i would would uh she'd set the dining <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> table with candles and
 		no one disturbed us no one called on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> and we would just have this quiet dinner for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of us
 		and that uh that's held up until our youngest is graduating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">college</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the couple of weeks</TIMEX> and we still do that
 	
 	
 		wow

 		well clams <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">casino</ENAMEX> if you like clams casino
 	
 	
 		i love clams but i'm not sure what clams <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">casino</ENAMEX> are and i don't know if i could find clams that i would eat down here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh yeah well but well i like  well you lived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX> so you know a little about you know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX> they they just kind of serve them on <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a half</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">shell</ENAMEX> with a little bit of uh stuffing
 		what we like the to do is uh
 		is to cut them out and then cut them into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">little quarters</TIMEX> or eighths you know not so much just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> big bite
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and then cut up fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peppers</ENAMEX> and fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tomatoes</ENAMEX> and fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">celery</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bread crumbs</ENAMEX> and mix it all together
 		and
 		pre cook <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacon</ENAMEX> so it's kind of soft
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and put a strip of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacon</ENAMEX> over the top of that and then and then pop them in the oven
 	
 	
 		God that sounds good
 	
 	
 		and we usually have that and then we'll have a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salad</ENAMEX>
 		and i'll throw a steak on the grill with uh what i call a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">potato</ENAMEX> bake
 		i buy a uh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> of yams and some either <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">red potato</ENAMEX> or either white potato
 		and i put them in a microwave and cook them
 		so they're <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fairly soft</TIMEX> and i slice them i peel the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">yam</ENAMEX> slice that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i slice the white <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">potato</ENAMEX> with the skin on
 		i slice up a mild onion preferably a  onion
 	
 	
 		now in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> it would have to be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> fifteen
 	
 	
 		oh
 		and then i put it in tin <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foil</ENAMEX> and i interweave put a i put a slice of white <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">potato</ENAMEX> and slice sweet <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">potato</ENAMEX> and slice of onion
 		and then i do that until i got
 		the size of a baked potato
 		put <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">butter</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX> on it garlic
 		close the tin <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foil</ENAMEX> and i throw it on the grill cause i like it a little crispy on the bottom so i throw it on the grill maybe about
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">ten minutes</TIMEX> before i put the steak on
 		and then once once the steak is done that's usually done
 		and then we have uh
 	
 	
 		God that sound wonderful
 	
 	
 		and then either spinach i like spinach or uh asparagus
 		because we grow own <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">asparagus</ENAMEX> we have asparagus patch so in fact right now it's it's in season so we just go out and there
 		lop off a few
 		and then whatever you want for desert
 	
 	
 		well i'll give you one that that that i i put together modified out of a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Heart Smart Cookbook</ENAMEX>
 		now my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> really thinks that this is one of those <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> fancy <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sauces</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so when he  when he request this i always tell him he has to take the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> for an hour
 		and it really only takes <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about fifteen or twenty minutes</TIMEX> to do  but it gives me forty <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five minutes</TIMEX> to sit by myself where it's quiet
 	
 	
 		that's nice
 	
 	
 		but what you do is you go take you can use <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pork</ENAMEX> tender loin it's more expensive but i and i like the leaner cut of pork
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		the um like the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">center</ENAMEX> cut pork <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chops</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and you you need to have them thick at least a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three-quarters</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">an inch</NUMEX> think
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		and all you do is take those things and coat them in lemon pepper marinade
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		on both sides
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um when you say lemon pepper <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">marinade</ENAMEX> you put <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lemon juice</ENAMEX> and pepper together
 	
 	
 		no just the uh the you know you can do that just that you buy just lemon pepper
 	
 	
 		the spice that you buy
 		
 
 		okay all right
 	
 	
 		and then you take about two tablespoons of butter
 		which you know most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> kind of go  you know this is a low fat recipe but it is
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and you just melt that in a skillet
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		you broken the uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pork chops</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pork</ENAMEX> fillets
 	
 	
 		okay
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you just brown them on both sides and i like to get them at a good golden brown
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		and then just take them and stick them on a plate and keep them warm and into that same skillet add the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">juice</ENAMEX> of lemon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about anywhere from a quarter</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a half a cup</NUMEX>
 		to that you add <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> tablespoons of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Worcestershire sauce</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		two
 	
 	
 		and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> teaspoon to a tablespoon depending on how much you like it
 	
 	
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> tablespoons wait wait a minute that was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> tablespoons of Worcestershire
 	
 	
 		uh
 		yeah Worcestershire
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		and then
 		anywhere from a teaspoon to a tablespoon of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dijon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mustard</ENAMEX>
 		and what you do is you just cook this down and it makes a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a really</TIMEX> pretty almost dark black brown <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">viscous sauce</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it's pretty spicy now i like to throw in just a you know a shot of white wine
 		and then you just take the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pork chops</ENAMEX> put them on a serving platter pour this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sauce</ENAMEX> over it and i garnish it with fresh cut chives
 		it really is a really pretty entree to look at
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sauce</ENAMEX> i mean it has kind of this nice <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> flavor where you feel that somebody's you know played around with this all afternoon
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that
 	
 	
 		and i have served it to company
 	
 	
 		so so you cooked the the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pork</ENAMEX> is cooked at that point then okay
 	
 	
 		and
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		but you know the trick with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pork</ENAMEX> most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> think you have to cook it at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred and eighty five</NUMEX> degrees well done
 	
 	
 		oh no no
 	
 	
 		you don't have to do that
 		it can still be pink in the middle and that makes all the world of difference
 	
 	
 		oh uh um
 	
 	
 		the other thing that that i've really got into down here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> is fresh uh herbs
 	
 	
 		that's what we do we we grow our own and dry them and
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		well see i don't have to try them cause they'll they'll pretty much grow <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all winter</TIMEX> long and if
 	
 	
 		yeah you <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> are kind of lucky down there
 	
 	
 		oh i don't know we also have you know foot long roaches <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all year</TIMEX> long too
 	
 	
 		yeah  yeah
 	
 	
 		hey don't laugh
 		don't laugh but what makes a really elegant um just a side dish and most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> don't have any idea what it is why they don't i don't know and you can make it a day ahead of time
 		because i just take about a cup of fresh cut basil i mean i really like basil
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		and then cook <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spaghetti</ENAMEX> and i the the this is smaller thread spaghetti it's like the cappelletti is the better
 	
 	
 		okay yep
 	
 	
 		add and i add almost equal parts parmesan cheese
 		a a healthy balance of garlic i mean i really like garlic
 	
 	
 		oh that's what we do we yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah so you're basically makes a kind of a a pesto
 	
 	
 		like a pesto yeah
 	
 	
 		yes but if you serve it cold it really is just a wonderful
 	
 	
 		so is it a cup of basil leave fresh basil leaves
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX> and pine nuts and if you can't get pine nuts because to me they're always kind of mushy i just grind up walnuts and use that in it
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		it really is nice
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that's uh
 	
 	
 		and even my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> will eat it
 		and they've gotten to be kind of food snobs one of them went over to
 	
 	
 		we're going we're going to have that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX> we're going to do the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pork</ENAMEX> and
 		we don't have the we don't have any fresh basil but we've got dried well we'll have to go down to the market
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dry basil</ENAMEX> doesn't have quite the taste
 	
 	
 		it doesn't you can't pesto out of it they've got some pesto frozen though
 	
 	
 		yeah i keep i do that and i find that it tastes just about as good
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and i freeze it in like little <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">half cup</NUMEX> quantity so i can even pull it out whenever i want to
 	
 	
 		but i like that i like those uh-huh i like that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sauce</ENAMEX> with the pork
 	
 	
 		you you'll be surprised you'll be really surprised at just how simple it is and and it's not a a clear cut you know this this this and this it's kind of to taste
 	
 	
 		and
 		yeah
 		that's what i'm going to do because we each take turns doing it
 		you know i usually do the grill work and you know it depends if she makes uh uh anything with shrimp on it or not you know she'll do that but i'll do the grill stuff but this is nice this is i can cook the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pork</ENAMEX> on the grill
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and just make the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sauce</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know what also is really good just really really good and really really simple if you like to do grilling
 		if you can get a hold of fresh sage
 	
 	
 		yep yep
 	
 	
 		have you ever worked with that
 		just take the fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sage</ENAMEX> and and you know
 		crumble it so that you you release the oils
 	
 	
 		yep
 	
 	
 		pour you know put that stuff over fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pork chops</ENAMEX>
 		and if you've got balsamic vinegar there
 	
 	
 		we do we make all of our vinegars in fact we do canning too we do all of our own canning and
 	
 	
 		oh i love that stuff
 		oh
 		i do my own vinegars too but just put a a touch of balsamic vinegar on that until
