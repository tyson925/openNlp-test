 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well what are your did you like do you use credit cards
 	
 	
 		uh not very often i usually uh the ones we use is like visa and we always try to pay it back at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the month</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		huh-uh so it doesn't gets uh uh the credit uh
 	
 	
 		i have uh uh
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh interest rate is so high that you're really if you're going to use credit cards you need to use that policy i think don't you
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		otherwise you end up paying so much more for your merchandise that it's hardly
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		uh it's not a very good idea
 	
 	
 		do you have a lot of credit cards
 	
 	
 		well i have a lot of them but i don't use them very much though
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i use them mostly for big things like maybe sometimes uh
 		tuition if it's
 		you know if i'm short to go ahead and get it and then try to get it saved back as quick as i can
 		the other thing i i think if you do get overextended a little bit you need to be sure and pay it off
 		uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> at a time because i think you could run forever paying what they require
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		just goes on and on
 	
 	
 		which is what they want
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i think a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> go in debt because they think oh you know i can just charge it but really i mean if they don't have the money then they aren't going to have it in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a month</TIMEX> so
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true
 	
 	
 		they uh make the mistake of pushing all their cards
 	
 	
 		there are times when it's when it's very useful like uh emergency trip
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		or something sometimes when you when you
 		the the money will be available but it's
 		you know not immediately handy i think uh they're very helpful plus the fact that it's helpful not to have to carry a lot of money sometimes
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but uh i you really do need to be very um
 		oh responsible about it or you end up in deep trouble
 	
 	
 		yeah i made that mistake when i <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> got a job and that's kind of like
 		it took me quite a while to pay them off
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so
 		after after that i decided well i'm not going to use them at all
 		and just try to pay cash for everything and that worked for a while and then
 		we got married so we decided to you know if we used them we would
 		pay them off as we go so
 	
 	
 		right
 		right that can be very handy under those kind of circumstances
 		the other thing about them is too if you really don't you really need to get some and use them because if you have never used them and developed and haven't developed a credit thing
 		it stops you from doing a lot of things if you if you pay for everything by cash uh there is a lot of things that a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who will not give you credit when you need something like a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> or
 	
 	
 		right
 		that's true yeah
 	
 	
 		a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> so so they they have become a very vital part of our of our monetary  system over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last few years</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but uh it's true you have to be very careful or you end up
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> going in the deep end and uh and an awful lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are in trouble
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		we have a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> living with us who works for a credit card uh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> that and he makes calls to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who have problems you know credit problems that are trying to work out of them and uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 		poor thing he comes home very depressed <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">every night</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		because the world has so many problems of that sort so it's uh it's uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's a really big problem i think and um takes mature <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to
 		to treat it uh so that it's so that it's a real advantage to you instead of a disadvantage
 	
 	
 		right i think um the way the tax system was they encouraged <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to use credit cards you know with a big write off at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the year</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but now it's like it's punch money because
 	
 	
 		right it doesn't do you any good now does it right
 	
 	
 		you cannot
 		right you cannot write off your interest
 	
 	
 		even before it probably wasn't though because you didn't get anywhere near as much as what it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you didn't get to claim anywhere near what you ended up paying
 		so well i'm not that uh other than that i don't have too much on credit cards but
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it's good to talk to you
 	
 	
 		yeah you too thanks for calling bye
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh</ENAMEX> bye now
