 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		um where are you from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Connie</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i'm from Dennison
 	
 	
 		from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Dennison</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">well</ENAMEX> we live in Plano
 	
 	
 		Plano great what are they doing anything down there for recycling
 	
 	
 		yes as a matter of fact they really are in uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February</TIMEX> i think it was the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> started the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> phase
 		of a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> part <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> phases of a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> part phase in for uh uh city wide you know collection type thing
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and the way they're doing this is they said no more trash bags is that how you set out your trash
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah that's the way we always had too no more trash bags and they assigned everybody
 		well i think it's <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">ninety five gallons</NUMEX> big bucket
 	
 	
 		well that's neat
 	
 	
 		and uh and you can put everything you know they all look the same they're great big green things they run on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rollers</ENAMEX> they're not hard at all even my
 		you know <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten year old</TIMEX> can do it take them out to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> we used to have twice <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a week</TIMEX> collection and now they have once a week collection for that
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and you don't have to use the garbage bags anymore you just uh
 	
 	
 		do you separate your trash
 	
 	
 		not yet but
 	
 	
 		well i think they should do that
 	
 	
 		that's the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> part the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> part is we now have a
 		uh paper type biodegradable real big bag for all the lawn clippings and anything and they've always been encouraging us to not bag our
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		i thought about that last <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last this last couple weeks ago</TIMEX> when we bagged up our leaves it was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixteen</TIMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eighteen</NUMEX> bags of leaves
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh gosh
 	
 	
 		and yeah and it takes forever for that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plastic</ENAMEX> to dissolve
 	
 	
 		well we have a garden and so we have always you know we'll rake the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">leaves</ENAMEX> and then we mow them so they're little chibbles you know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		and you use it as mulch
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh</ENAMEX> and use them as mulch in the garden or around the yard so you know we've done that for along time and we try not to bag our grass clippings unless its just so long we have to but then we put it back on the garden so i've never worried about that but
 		um they are doing that now where you cannot put out grass stuff you see when you put out your regular trash
 	
 	
 		ah
 		they won't let you good
 	
 	
 		huh-uh now the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> part is and it was supposed to have started in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX> but something and i don't remember the exact reason from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Persian Gulf</ENAMEX> um
 		trickle down fouled that up and so now we're not going to do that until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">end of June</TIMEX> but then they will give us another container that where we will put everything recyclable glass plastic
 	
 	
 		right
 		paper
 	
 	
 		uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> can go now we bundle that on top of our  and set it out beside our green
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		thing full a newspaper but but the other kinds of paper will go
 		and like i say did i say glass <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glass plastic</ENAMEX> other papers tin aluminum
 		and there's something else
 	
 	
 		oh i can't think of anything milk <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cartons</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">soda</ENAMEX> bottles
 	
 	
 		yeah like that too that all comes under plastic and glass i can't think what the other thing is anyway we won't even have to sort it at least that's what they say but the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> will come by and sort it there at the curb
 	
 	
 		well that's good that's neat
 		oh that's going to be a lot of hard work though
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		for them
 	
 	
 		yes but it will be more profitable in the long run from what i understand because
 	
 	
 		well i know everybody's throwing away <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">millions of dollars</NUMEX> worth of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plastic</ENAMEX> and stuff everyday just to be buried
 	
 	
 		they have already they sell all this stuff and see we have recycling <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> here in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> that are setup by the city
 		and that are you know emptied but you know like it will say on there uh green glass only or aluminum only
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and then somebody comes along and mixes it up doesn't do it right
 		its better for them to hire somebody and pay somebody to do it right because if you even put in just say you had this huge
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">container</ENAMEX> of white <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glass</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three or four</NUMEX> brown or green glass bottles got in there and got shattered there's no way you can pick all that out
 	
 	
 		yeah uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you see what i'm saying so it you know its useless
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		that well it's not useless it just can't be sold as clear glass anymore back to the recycle places they say well uh you know look you already you've got and they have percentages you know
 	
 	
 		they're not doing much down here though
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		that what they will accept
 	
 	
 		the only they think i've heard of them doing down here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dennison</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wal-Mart</ENAMEX> let's you put there you know uh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk cartons</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">liter</ENAMEX> bottles those clear plastic bottles that's about it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>

 		your own little paper bags or plastic bags they'll let you recycle them or you can bring them in and actually use them again
 	
 	
 		little carry-on bags
 		
 
 		okay well they're doing that but every time i get paper bags at a grocery <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX> i bring home bugs
 	
 	
 		do you um i
 	
 	
 		yeah and i can't do it
 	
 	
 		don't know that i've ever had that problem i just try to reuse <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mine</ENAMEX> a lot at home too and
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		but used to you know if i had a torn sack when i got home i just trashed it you know and anymore i don't do that i'll put it in with the paper recycling you know the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX> or something
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah well they ought to do that around down here
 	
 	
 		um that always seems to help the uh um a lot of times if i know i'm just even if i know i've got a big <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> so you know i rarely come home with you know just a sack or two
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but i have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> canvas sacks that are big that are especially for taking to the grocery <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX> that kind of thing and i'll always take those and use them and um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		right i've seen those
 		real environmentally conscious aren't you
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i always have been i always have been and uh i kind of got out of the habit of it you know for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few years</TIMEX> when my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> were
 	
 	
 		
 
 		small
 	
 	
 		well when they
 	
 	
 		did you use diapers
 	
 	
 		what
 	
 	
 		disposable diapers
 	
 	
 		i didn't with my <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> but i did with my <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">last two</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 		goodness you've got <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and yeah i have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> and uh
 		well the actually now i think about it i think it was number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> that i used them a lot with and then number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> came along and i used them some with him
 		most of the time i think i used them with number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		well i've got a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three month</TIMEX> old i used disposables on her for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about a month</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a half</TIMEX> just to keep her from breaking out so bad
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		and then she had reaction to the
 	
 	
 		oh she had reactions to cloth diapers it was from staying wet more often
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah yeah oh they've just improved the
 	
 	
 		and
 		yeah well she's doing better they have are they biodegradable or more biodegradable i heard they're the worst things
 	
 	
 		disposables so much
 		oh yeah they really fill up
 	
 	
 		because they stay forever
 	
 	
 		but they work so good  i mean that's one thing that we moms just think oh gosh
 	
 	
 		yeah they do
 		i don't mind using cloth diapers i really don't it's not all that much more work
 	
 	
 		i uh
 		pardon
 	
 	
 		it's not all that much more work for disposable i mean for cloth
 	
 	
 		well i always had you know several in diapers at the same time so that may have been you know why they looked so nice to me but
 	
 	
 		yeah well cloth i mean disposables do look better they look they're not quite as bulky
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		she looks like a little <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mushroom</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but i used disposables with my first little boy
 	
 	
 		well you know that well i think its just
 		you know that you i think have to have in your mind an attitude of trading off you just say to yourself well this is not worth it to me to do such and so
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but i want to make up for it because i want to be real conscientious in this and that you know what i'm saying you
 	
 	
 		right well i'm
 	
 	
 		you know all of us can to something and you know what works for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> may not work for another family
 		and
 	
 	
 		well i know to with disposable diapers though if you use cloth diapers your polluting with more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">soap</ENAMEX> and using more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> and all that
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true and you're using more electricity you're using it uh
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		more where as when you buy the others they used it more at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factory</ENAMEX>  so you know you wonder you know you're not using it but somebody used it to create that item you know
 	
 	
 		yeah you're right yeah
 		you're right  i didn't even think about that
 	
 	
 		so
 		but you know you know then you you figured on down the line it did give <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> jobs
 		i use cloth diapers for a lot of stuff just besides you know if my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> have got a cold you know i put them in bed with cloth diapers  you know
 	
 	
 		with a cloth diaper
 	
 	
 		to use instead of a hanky or or tissue you you know they can could just flat go through <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">three dollars</NUMEX> worth of tissue you in a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> you know

 		oh well
 	
 	
 		no question about it well i just you know i'm really glad to see us a world coming back to this and
 	
 	
 		yeah it's really coming to a head it's been building up for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few years</TIMEX> i remember this going on when i was a teenager
