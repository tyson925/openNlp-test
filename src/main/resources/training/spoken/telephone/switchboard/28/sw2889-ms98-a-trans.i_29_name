 		uh we bought it at an unfinished uh furniture place
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and sanded it down and uh stained it and then lacquered over it
 	
 	
 		it's pretty time consuming isn't it
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		but
 		it's good it's nice to have it when you're done i mean looks pretty so
 	
 	
 		um-hum sure is
 	
 	
 		i've done that once but it didn't come out that well
 	
 	
 		did you use a did you use a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zar</ENAMEX> stain
 	
 	
 		uh i don't remember it was i had my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> buy everything and i ended up it was their table their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen</ENAMEX> table it came out really dark
 	
 	
 		uh
 		they had a um well i saw the commercial on TV and they and uh and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> at the unfinished <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX> recommended it that's called a it's <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Z A R</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh it spreads real evenly and it doesn't dry too fast so it's if you get too much in one spot you can smooth it out
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and we put we put tung <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> on it kind of made it sticky for a while but after it dried out it was you know it was real hard and it was all right
 	
 	
 		i remember  took me a long time it took me like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several months</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several weeks</TIMEX> to do it during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX> and then after i got it done it was pretty dark and ended up not being real smooth looking
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
