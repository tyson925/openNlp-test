 		oh okay
 		that area that dialect
 	
 	
 		right right  also i lived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Georgia</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about four years</TIMEX> so the uh there's a difference too between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">east</ENAMEX> and west in the south
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh the way in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> speak anyway my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> is um
 		i guess it's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about twenty five hundred</NUMEX> square foot and i have uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedrooms</ENAMEX> at the present we're busting out walls and things like that

 		we have two
 		yeah we'll have enough <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedroom space</ENAMEX> it's we're rearranging our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> because the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedrooms</ENAMEX> are kind of small
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and so we're going to enlarge our master <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedroom</ENAMEX> and take out a couple of walls and enlarge it and then shuffle the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> around a little bit
 	
 	
 		that's kind of like what we would like to do we just had a baby <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple months ago</TIMEX> and we've got a den that's more or less a spare <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> we rarely go in there except for to play chess
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		we want to make that a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedroom</ENAMEX> for my stepdaughter and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> and uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		we need the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> extra room like like i said our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> are too small the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedrooms</ENAMEX> are too small the living room and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen</ENAMEX> are huge but the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedrooms</ENAMEX> are too small where you've got to
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		leave the furniture just one certain way you can't rearrange it at all
 	
 	
 		right
 		there's they uh i know what you're saying there ours is the same and they tend to put windows in the strangest places
 	
 	
 		
  
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		You know we have windows in our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bathrooms</ENAMEX> which really makes it difficult for
 	
 	
 		
  
 		yeah we've got <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> great big windows in our back bathroom
 	
 	
 		um-hum you you're kind of limited in what you can do there and everything so
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		no privacy
 	
 	
 		uh no we don't have a lot of that yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well we've got <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX> windows on every <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wall</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i'd hate to clean these windows i really would
 	
 	
 		i figured i'm going to have to hire somebody to remove our windows and put new ones in that are easier to clean ours are the double pane and you can't really clean them on the inside
 	
 	
 		ours are those too yeah you must live in an older <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> too then
 	
 	
 		you know
 		right i do the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> is about um i'd say almost <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty years old</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so it's not a new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> it's it's seen some wear and tear
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ours</ENAMEX> has too now when we moved in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> that sold it to us had said he had remodeled it
 	
 	
 		you know
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and
 		he did it hisself so most of that by now is falling apart
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		you know well i mean it's not just horrible but like this tiles come loose off the wall the whole <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bathroom</ENAMEX> is covered from ceiling to foot in tile and i don't like that at all
 	
 	
 		um
 		oh that is awful
 	
 	
 		with that
 		uh the great big tiles square tiles like that you put on the floor
 	
 	
 		uh-huh he did it in that
 	
 	
 		the the huge one yeah instead of wallpaper i wouldn't mind it if it was like short tiles for that
 	
 	
 		the normal tiles right
 	
 	
 		you put right that you put around a bathtub that would be prettier
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but this looks like floor
 		covering on the wall it just doesn't look good
 	
 	
 		oh and also they're very heavy and so they tend to come off a whole lot easier
 	
 	
 		right there's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> big one that has come off and short of putting nails through it we can't get it back on
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		so
 		and he rewired the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and it's shorting out here and there and
 	
 	
 		oh wow i that's one of the things we've been fortunate with is our wiring been okay we don't have a we don't have enough power
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
  
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		
  
 	
 	
 		um our our breakers aren't aren't powerful enough to take to to really help with the load in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> i mean we need to redo some rewiring ourselves but our plumbing is awful there is nothing there is a shut off valve that's outside that doesn't work
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		um
 	
 	
 		and there's no other real shut off valves inside the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> so if something breaks we have to shut it off from the main in the street you know and oh it's it can be really bizarre  and we never know where it's going to flood
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		we've got power surges on the west side of our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> we've got our stereo hooked up
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		well that the power makes it run it's never ran it's always ran just fine the clock and stuff but it runs <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about ten minutes</TIMEX> fast except for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about a month</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about a month</TIMEX> the the clock ran normal
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		um
 	
 	
 		and then the power went off again lightning or something knocked it out and we hooked it back up and now it's running <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">fifteen minutes</TIMEX> fast again but on the east side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> it runs fine
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		oh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> you do have a strange wiring problem there
 	
 	
 		he put new wiring in it's all new wiring up in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">attic</ENAMEX> or i guess crawl space
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		oh no he didn't know what he was doing he really should have hired people
 	
 	
 		well that's something my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>'s in construction and he won't even touch electrical stuff he i i mean he'll do a little minimal things but he won't do any major rewiring he says he'd rather pay the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">electrician</ENAMEX> to handle it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right he'll end up killing himself
 	
 	
 		pardon
 	
 	
 		end up killing theirselves
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> he'll change out a light switch but that's about as far as he'll go
 	
 	
 		well that's the way <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mine</ENAMEX> is you know i mean he he well he said he went up in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">attic</ENAMEX> and looked around and he was like
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		oh my God he says looks like a bunch of spaghetti up there and we had squirrels in our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">attic</ENAMEX> when we first moved in because the roof was so sorry
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">uh</ENAMEX> was a what
 	
 	
 		the roof was really sorry i mean when we moved in we had no idea how bad it was it was a wood shingle roof and we <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first year</TIMEX> we were living there we had to replace the roof

 		he probably knows i don't know what it is off hand
 	
 	
 		well he's got <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> layers of shingles up there and he told us it was a completely new roof like i said he didn't know what he was doing

 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i would go in and i'd turn on a light in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> you know and the light would come on and the whole thing would be full of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> and i mean the light would still come on  it didn't blow up or anything
 	
 	
 		
 
 		my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX> or a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> of mine when i lived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Louisiana</ENAMEX> her
