 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so we'll make something you know uh some sort of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pasta</ENAMEX> or something you know homemade <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pasta</ENAMEX> or lasagna or something
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah that's something that's you know really easy in fact i'm having a dinner <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next Saturday</TIMEX> and that is what i'm having is pasta
 	
 	
 		oh good idea what
 	
 	
 		well for for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> i got a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">um pasta</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">machine</ENAMEX> and all all my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> are really anxious you know to have the homemade <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">noodles</ENAMEX> so um
 	
 	
 		um
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electric</ENAMEX> or uh
 	
 	
 		no it's the hand kind old fashion kind
 	
 	
 		best kind that that that that's we we bought one in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX> that's the best kind to have
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah yeah i like you know kind of still having in put that not everything's being done for me you know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh</ENAMEX> that's real good
 	
 	
 		but um yeah so that's what i'm going to be cooking you know i thought i would have like an antipasta <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">um salad</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> and um then just something for desert you know <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bread</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cheese</ENAMEX> stuff like that
 	
 	
 		um
 		that would be great have you made <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pasta</ENAMEX> before
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um so you know so you know that it's a a lot of fun actually
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah yeah a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> think though that i've talked to about it think that it's you know a lot of hard work and i said heck it's kind of easy
 	
 	
 		i
 		it actually is if if if you have a food processor i don't know if you have a food <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">processor</ENAMEX> or not actually it it turns out that if if if if you really want to be nice and easy about it you can make the dough in the food <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">processor</ENAMEX> really simply
 	
 	
 		yeah i do
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and then um and with that it it becomes really easy to make colorful <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pasta</ENAMEX> by throwing in some spinach or some tomato or something and mixing it up it it it it's just a snap from there and then you get to roll it out yourself
 	
 	
 		right right
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i made yucky i making yucky every <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">now and then</TIMEX> as well
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it's also <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> think it's real hard it just time consuming to get all of the little things right otherwise it's real simple it's good stuff
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		what other kinds of uh dinner <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX>  do you serve
 	
 	
 		um well i don't entertain that often uh when i do though i i have some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> that i always  like to experiment on but you know um i see a recipe and think oh wow i'd really like to try this cause i'm single and i live by myself
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so it's not necessarily something that i would cook just for myself
 	
 	
 		right you didn't want to cook
 	
 	
 		so i'll say okay you <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> are experimental i want say how this is going to turn out  but  here we go and usually i'm i'm pretty good about it
 	
 	
 		that's great
 	
 	
 		um i have this really good recipe for this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">um pork</ENAMEX> chop and apple casserole kind of thing and um you put stuffing and put poached <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">apples</ENAMEX> and everything and
 		my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girlfriend</ENAMEX> and her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> loved it in fact she passed it on to her <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		huh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so it's like it really made the rounds and i was quite impressed with myself if i should say so
 	
 	
 		well that yeah that's the way these things sort of make it is you make it for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> as an experiment and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i usually find it when i make up for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time i usually doctor it just a little bit you know my own way here and there and it works real well
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		well i'm the kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cook</ENAMEX> that i don't normally measure things i just kind of throw them in and you know i don't to the point of you know measuring down to the exact amount that they say
 	
 	
 		that means you're a real cook
 	
 	
 		oh is that what it means
 	
 	
 		if you've ever watched the ones on television like uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeff Schmidt</ENAMEX> the super gourmet he he just throws takes stuff he says yeah about an ounce of this  or something
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it's real good yeah we have a
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		we do uh
 		uh middle eastern dinner quite a bit actually or uh we have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> other that have never experienced it before and haven't had much middle eastern food
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		no i haven't
 	
 	
 		we make uh
 		because we're my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Syrian</ENAMEX> and um her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> always have this food she grew up in and i've made some of it before as well so we make uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four or five</NUMEX> middle eastern dishes that are just all real simple
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		we put them out for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and and that's always a real big kick for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who want you know who've never tried it before
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		that's that's that's that's a fun idea i mean if you ever uh want something different to try
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i would try that
 	
 	
 		um yeah i've been wanting to take an um oriental cooking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">class</ENAMEX> and i just haven't gotten around to it yet
 	
 	
 		oh do you have a wok though yeah those
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i stir fry things on occasion but i'd like to know more about you know more elaborate things i guess
 	
 	
 		i think it's God's gift to cooking
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		because it's just quick it's easy um and the food just comes out you know if you do it right i think it comes out
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> comes out very tasty not very mushy you know and and it doesn't taste like <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a million</NUMEX> calories of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> so
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		we live live in our wok
 	
 	
 		uh-huh really
 	
 	
 		yeah we we we like to eat even when we eat out and stuff we eat a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> or you know <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Korean</ENAMEX> or something or <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Vietnamese</ENAMEX> or something
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and that seems to so wok <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> seems to be our thing
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so anything else you cook
 	
 	
 		um i just kind of you know <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cook</ENAMEX> here cook there
 		i don't have any <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> specialty i mean i'm always willing to try anything usually
 	
 	
 		well that's good that's always the way to do it i think it's the
 	
 	
 		and i i especially like <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">baking</ENAMEX> and making deserts i've taken a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cake decorating class</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		oh the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wilson</ENAMEX> course
 	
 	
 		no no actually it was a private <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">course</ENAMEX> through like a company
 	
 	
 		i like it
 		that's great i haven't the the the thing i really want to do i keep seeing the signs for the the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wilson</ENAMEX> class
 	
 	
 		it is it's it's neat but it takes a long time you know i mean like i'm elected to always bring cakes into work
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		like for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>'s birthdays and that and it's like you know
 		you bake the cakes and then i guess just because i don't have the expertise to just hurry up and do it like you know some a professional would i try to i go real slow and you know it's a little time consuming but it's really worth your effort once you see how you do
 	
 	
 		right
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah oh yeah we have um my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> can do it he's he's uh got a degree in business management so he learned to uh how to do this really well
