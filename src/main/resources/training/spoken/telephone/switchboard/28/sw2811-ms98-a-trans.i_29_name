 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay what i was gonna to tell you about is that my fiance and i have just finished as a matter of fact today restoring a seventy <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mercedes</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you don't mean it
 	
 	
 		i i we've done a little bit of it ourselves but mostly we were lucky enough to find a a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> that works for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mercedes</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">dealership</ENAMEX> and he restores <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> on his on his uh you know off time
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		how'd you find this one
 	
 	
 		well it was uh a gentleman that works with my fiance and he had bought it for his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> and she wasn't taking care of it and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> was that obvious when they pulled up in it it had been really um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		pretty shabby shape huh
 	
 	
 		it was in a mess it was just in a terrible mess uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		so what's the last thing you ever had done to it
 	
 	
 		well the last thing we did to it was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> they had uh replaced the gear shift
 	
 	
 		my goodness
 	
 	
 		um it's uh it wasn't we had to order the part from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">dealership</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> put it in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> when you shifted it down you didn't know if you were in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> drive reverse whatever
 	
 	
 		oh i hear you
 	
 	
 		so that was the very last thing that we had to uh had to have done uh basically the whole <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>'s been redone they put in new um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		they used new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sheet metal</ENAMEX> and stuff to to repair the body i mean there were you know these rusted dents
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		a new paint job they uh redid all of the trim  we had the seats reupholstered we put in a new dash  it's been recarpeted it's just it was you know just completely
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		my goodness
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		my gosh y'all put a lot of money in this
 	
 	
 		yeah it was completely overhauled and uh for what
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		is it a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diesel</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it's a diesel um-hum it sure is
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		i guess it's what <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> speed on the column
 	
 	
 		yeah you're right um-hum
 	
 	
 		um-hum i seem to recall the old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mercedes</ENAMEX> had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> speeds on the column
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah and it's it's just been lovingly restored that's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> good thing about about having somebody to do it your you're you're there because they worked on it here at our home
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		so how many miles does it have on it
 	
 	
 		i have no idea i i doubt that anybody will ever really know
 	
 	
 		
 
 		why is the speedometer was disconnected or something
 	
 	
 		well i i i can't really remember what it shows on there but i remember when we discussed it we said that we were pretty sure that that was like times maybe or add <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an additional one hundred</NUMEX> added on to that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred thousand</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um</ENAMEX>
 		i hear you
 	
 	
 		yeah because it's uh it had definitely been through the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mill</ENAMEX> but uh
 	
 	
 		um
 		well i got a little <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> that uh has a certain history to it too
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it's an old seventy <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Maverick</ENAMEX> and i'm not trying to redo the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> or anything
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		but i've had it to drive back and forth to work <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">now</TIMEX> for some i guess <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nineteen years</TIMEX> or so
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		um-hum oh my gosh you've had it
 	
 	
 		and it's got <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two hundred</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">one thousand miles</NUMEX> on it
 	
 	
 		oh my word
 	
 	
 		and it's an automatic transmission and it's just a regular old everyday go back and forth to work car
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh i uh i guess the interesting history about this is about the only work i do on it myself an the last time i did do some work was i did a brake job on it
 		and that cost me <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fourteen</NUMEX> dollars
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		oh my word
 	
 	
 		by buying the parts at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the local discount <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parts houses</ENAMEX> you know and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and luckily this time didn't need to have drums turned or anything
 	
 	
 		replaced yeah
 	
 	
 		then i was able to do a brake job on there at fairly i think inexpensive price by doing it myself of course
 	
 	
 		yeah oh definitely
 	
 	
 		but another interesting aspect of this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> like yours is
 		uh it's only had the oil changed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about six</NUMEX> times since uh seventy <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">five thousand miles</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh gosh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		because i only change the oil every <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">five thousand miles</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		i do change <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> filters <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">every twelve thousand five hundred</NUMEX> though
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but uh other than that it only has the oil changed every <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">five thousand miles</NUMEX> and that is a a true statement i just wrote <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mobil Oil Corporation</ENAMEX> a letter as a matter of fact
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks ago</TIMEX> thanking them for the uh good durability that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mobil One</ENAMEX> oil which is what i use in it provides
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		because it does have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two hundred and one thousand</NUMEX> honest miles
 	
 	
 		gosh that's unbelievable
 	
 	
 		and it's only had the oil changed those few times and uh it uh performs very nicely it's shifting the uh transmission of course i get overhauled on it not overhauled but
 	
 	
 		hum
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		all the uh fluid drained out and new screen and and filters and everything put them in every fifty <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">thousand miles</NUMEX> religiously
 	
 	
 		right right
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so it still shifts just a crisp <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> as it did when it was brand new
 	
 	
 		that's amazing that is amazing
 	
 	
 		and the engine still runs just as strong <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> as it did when it was brand new
 	
 	
 		is it the same engine that's been in it all the time
 	
 	
 		oh yeah the the engine's never had any work done on it all except at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ninety</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">five thousand miles</NUMEX> i think it was uh we rebuilt the carburetor and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a hundred thirty five thousand miles</NUMEX> we put a new uh water pump on it no internal work has ever been done on the engine
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it's had uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> starters uh one fuel pump <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about six eight ten</NUMEX> batteries i guess been put in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> and um uh one uh uh um  voltage <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulator</ENAMEX> during all this time
 	
 	
 		wow
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		and that's it nothing else been ever done to it except you know the usual filters and this that and the other that you have to put on a
 	
 	
 		that's amazing yeah
 	
 	
 		and doing that it and the uh radiator on it has been rebuilt twice
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		so the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> was how old when you when you bought it
 	
 	
 		well i bought it from a fellow that i knew uh that worked up here it had sixty <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">nine thousand miles</NUMEX> on it at that time
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		he always took good care of it and he bought it just to pull a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> with and when it when it got to be old and uh or older i bought it in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seventy seven</TIMEX> from him it was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about six years old</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah oh i see
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh it had sixty <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">nine thousand miles</NUMEX> on it and i had written about synthetic i had read about synthetic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> s in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Popular Science</ENAMEX> so i decided hey this is a good <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> to experiment on it i don't have much money in it you know i only bought it for a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">thousand dollars</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		exactly yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so i changed it over to uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mobil One</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">seventy five thousand miles</NUMEX> and i proceeded from then on to never change the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> but <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">every twenty five thousand miles</NUMEX> as they say on the can
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and uh but i
 	
 	
 		yeah oh is it does say that on the can
 	
 	
 		but the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> gets yeah it says that on the can <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mobil One</ENAMEX> cans if you read them says uh uh it it it says as as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">automobile</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX> recommends or <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">twenty five thousand miles</NUMEX> what they used to say anyway
 	
 	
 		i didn't realize that uh-huh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so i decided this would do as a good experiment and i had read about this these kinds of synthetic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oils</ENAMEX> in um as i said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Popular Science</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		right
 	
 	
 		but the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> gets so black that uh at <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">every twelve thousand five hundred miles</NUMEX> i do pull the oil filter and change out the oil filter and when you do that you have to add a quart
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> uses no <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> at all between oil changes i mean not a drop
 	
 	
 		oh i see yeah
 		that's amazing yeah and this is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Maverick</ENAMEX> you said
 	
 	
 		it's a seventy <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maverick</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Maverick</ENAMEX>
 		well i had uh i had owned a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cougar</ENAMEX> up until oh just <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several months ago</TIMEX> that i had had since uh um i think it was an <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eighty two</NUMEX> or something
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i had that car only uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about two years</TIMEX> and the engine blew in it
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and so i had to put in a new engine that was that's an experience when you have a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two year old</TIMEX> car you know and it wasn't in warranty then i mean it must have like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> after the warranty was expired it must have exploded
 	
 	
 		uh
 		my goodness
 		what kind of engine was it
 	
 	
 		i have no idea uh V is it V <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> i don't i don't know a lot of
 	
 	
 		well they have V eights they have V sixes and they have
 	
 	
 		what's the biggest one is a V <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> bigger
 	
 	
 		i guess the V <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah that's what it had in it
 	
 	
 		well that's interesting
 	
 	
 		and yeah so it it uh that's my latest experience with something major
 	
 	
 		i guess that's uh uh you uh you must undoubtedly get all kinds of different uh
 		uh engine types or whatever in terms of their durability depending on how they got made but this one here has just lasted and lasted and lasted
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		well see that's what i was thinking i thought maybe it has something because that turned me off from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> i mean  you know something and and i'm sure i shouldn't i shouldn't feel that way that's why i was surprised to hear you talk about this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> it sounds very resilient
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		um
 	
 	
 		whatever they have in that engine whatever a kind of engine it is in that car
 	
 	
 		it's just a V <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> same as what was in your <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cougar</ENAMEX> probably
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah yeah maybe it has something to do but i i know i took good care of it i changed the oil quite often i didn't even do that myself i i could never do any of this myself
 	
 	
 		you did
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know i'm just not uh i'm not uh
 	
 	
 		and it still blew up
 		you're sure nobody ever sugared your gas tank or anything that got mad at you about something
 	
 	
 		yeah and it still blew up
 		well now that yeah not that i know of
 	
 	
 		because i had a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">van</ENAMEX> that uh somebody sugared my gas tank and it it tore that engine up and i had to replace it but if it hadn't been for that then uh
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		i would've never had any problems
 	
 	
 		you would never have a problem well you know that's possible i never had thought about it but that's my i'm i have a
 	
 	
 		all it takes is a cup full of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sugar</ENAMEX> dumped down your gas tank and it will ruin the engine
 	
 	
 		what what does that do
 	
 	
 		it uh freezes up the rings and everything inside so they can't lubricate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sugar</ENAMEX> does it turns to like a a syrupy like crud
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh okay just like just like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sugar</ENAMEX> would it turns syrupy
 	
 	
 		yeah and uh it it freezes everything up it scalds it scalds the bearings in an engine it essentially just freezes it up
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and the only thing to do is take it apart and completely rebuild it from bottom out
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and generally it ruins the engine to the point where you have to replace it
 	
 	
 		yeah ugh well that maybe that's what happened to it because it had been it had been fine but the odd thing about it was is after i had that engine replaced that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> ran hot
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every summer</TIMEX> i mean even though yes <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> is notorious i mean we it's true we have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred and eight</NUMEX> degree <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> but you know it uh i had i had trouble with that car after that i don't know if it was just a lemon
 	
 	
 		um
 		um
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		um
 	
 	
 		even though it was a brand new engine you know so uh
 	
 	
 		that's amazing
 		might not have been rebuilt properly or they might have put too high a degree thermostat in it
 	
 	
 		yeah course it was a brand new engine supposedly now that's what the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">dealership</ENAMEX> told me you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well even if it was if they put the wrong size thermostat in it for the climate you're in it could could make it run hotter
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		that's what i i know my i had uh had my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> to finally took it down there because i would take it back and forth and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">dealership</ENAMEX> would not it was i still had the problem it just continued and continued and they would charge me you know <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">two hundred dollars</NUMEX> every time they looked at it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and um he kept saying the same thing he said it seems like it was your thermostat but at any rate it was really never rectified and i told the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that when i sold it to them i said you know you you might need to watch out but they didn't seem to mind
 	
 	
 		um
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		they wanted the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> so
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		you know as far as my ability to do anything on it i can check the oil i know  that's about as far as it goes it's been amazing to watch these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> work on this car i mean you know just from
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		how did y'all come to uh to uh make the seventy three your your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">collector</ENAMEX>'s item you might say
 	
 	
 		well it just this this gentleman had this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> and uh you know he had he had told my fiance that he was going to sell it i mean he just i mean he sold it to us for like <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three hundred</NUMEX> bucks you know and
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		and we took before we said we'd buy it we uh took it to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mercedes</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">dealership</ENAMEX> and they looked at the engine and uh the engine had been rebuilt about uh i think the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> had told us <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">two hundred miles</NUMEX> previously or something and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		they said it you know the engine alone was worth you know much more than that so we didn't feel like there was any problem
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh it's it's definitely been amazing to to see the transformation we took
 		we took after pictures it's a shame that we didn't take before pictures because yeah it was just uh as i said rusted dents and the color was that dark dark green that's almost
 	
 	
 		no you should've
