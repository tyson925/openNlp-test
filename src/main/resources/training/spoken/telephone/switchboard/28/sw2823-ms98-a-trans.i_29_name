 
     		
 	
 		hi
 	
 	
 		
 
 		okay
 		uh do you have a budget
 	
 	
 		we sure do as a matter of fact i do the finances in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> and what i do is take uh entire take home pay and then i like divvy it up into <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX> into the house
 		into the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utilities</ENAMEX> anything that's to do with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utilities</ENAMEX> or electric or anything like that goes into the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> budget
 		and then i have one for the food and one for um and and each of these is allotted a certain amount of money and hopefully  we stay within that budget and then uh we have some for uh debt
 		and some for just plain <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> you know like if the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> need clothes or if um
 		oh i don't know
 		you know if something something in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house well</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> one gets the money for the budget if we need something new in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> or something like that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and that's pretty much how we do it
 	
 	
 		does does it i mean does it work pretty good i mean you are you able to stay on track pretty much
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum it does uh now the way that we can really get off track is if i start to pull money from something and put it into another into another budget like if i
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		have money put into the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> budget
 		and all the bills that go with that and i start siphon siphoning money out of that like into the food bill budget
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um to buy more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> and i don't do that usually but when it does happen then i get into problems with you know then i have to take money from somewhere else to pay the bills on the house
 		and i don't like to do that then you can get really into trouble and that doesn't happen very often because i'm pretty strict i don't usually take money from anywhere
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		unless i absolutely have to
 	
 	
 		yeah we don't
 		we don't really have a budget per se we pretty much know what our bills are and you know ours ours is pretty simple but uh but what i do have i do have we do have a plan where we do put <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> number of dollars away
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every month</TIMEX> both through the employment uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sectors</ENAMEX> and also privately in in an investment portfolio
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so that goes we take that out right off the top
 	
 	
 		well that's great
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		course the employment comes out before you ever see it but then the other stuff the private stuff we take out and then we disburse it into those uh accounts before we even start the rest
 		uh
 		but on the budget we of course we haven't really gotten into trouble by not having a budget yet i can see definitely see that there is a need for one though
 		and probably as my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> gets a little bit older and we start getting involved in in other major purchases and things like that we'll have to do that
 	
 	
 		uh it's it's kind of a good thing with my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> we can allot a certain amount of money and all of our we have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> each of our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> have a savings account and then there's a basic savings account like a family one
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and what the his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">um company</ENAMEX> does for us is we allot a certain amount and like you said uh
 		they take they just take that straight out of the paycheck and put it right in the savings account we don't even see that money we can take it i mean it's well available to us if we want to take it out but uh we just try not to touch that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but you know and so we try not to even take that as part of our budget we just try to put that right away in savings
 		it's very difficult sometimes to to not think and say well God we have a little bit in savings let's you know but you have to be quite um adamant and say you're not going to touch that so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah we
 		we have a we have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> savings account that we have jointly
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		that we can take out of if we if we decide we want something
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but that's the only one we touch everything else we have we have promised each other we will not touch anything else in fact like CDs and money markets and all kind of stuff we've got it set up to where it takes both of us to sign it
 	
 	
 		i think that's great
 	
 	
 		so in case one of us decides to get weak or something like that you know say well you know if we won't miss this or we won't miss that you know uh so our our investment portion of it we don't we don't even touch it if we get low on money or we we go other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">avenues</ENAMEX> we don't
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right
 	
 	
 		we don't ever touch that so
 	
 	
 		yeah we don't touch the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> we do have the joint one like you said and we do fluctuate money in that one if we want to and then there's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> other thing that we have and and we don't touch the money in that one
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		yeah we do the same for our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> we have uh of course when she was born we just took you know a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lump</ENAMEX> sum of money and put it in a C D
 	
 	
 		um-hum that's really good
 	
 	
 		as one one means and then we took i take a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">hundred dollar</NUMEX> savings bond out of every paycheck
 	
 	
 		that's good
 	
 	
 		that's goes directly for for her and then we also have a savings account which we do put <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> number of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">dollars</NUMEX> in per month which is able to at least build her education fund
 	
 	
 		you know and that's so important because <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> things can be so expensive they really can
 	
 	
 		well if you if you really look at it the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> that are are born <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> by the time it's college time which will be it will be cost prohibitive if if <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> don't do it
 	
 	
 		that's right exactly
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> cannot make money that much money in in that time frame
 		uh working odd jobs to pay for that kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">bill</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it's just not possible to do it like maybe we did it when when we went to school
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and and there i don't think there's a lot of opportunity uh in the future for grants and loans and that kind of stuff because i don't i just don't think it's going to be there
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so i think if <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> don't provide it's it's not going to be there
 	
 	
 		it's too hard
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		who knows how much that's going to take i mean what we're taking out now may be enough it may not be and uh just don't know or there may be far more there than is ever needed but if it's if it's extra
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah yeah exactly
 	
 	
 		then she can go to
 		dental <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> or any or anything else that she wants to do from from there so
 	
 	
 		wouldn't that be great
 		i think that all of those things are really important and and uh the only reason i even went to a budget was i found that we
 		um
 		we would oh i can't think of the word like
 		or money would go through the cracks you know and at the end of the thing we'd go what happened to all that money the extra we had the overflow you know and it just siphons itself away somewhere into the air  and so
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		well you know i i you you brought up a real good point because i because i notice we do that occasionally we'll get it we'll get down and think where does all this go we just went out on a frivolous on a frivolous you know like a frivolous spending binge all of a sudden you know and now where did it go
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		it's hard to keep track isn't it
 	
 	
 		it is uh uh because i know we we have gotten ourselves into that predicament a few times
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but we've always managed you know to you know to get out of it fairly quickly we don't have a lot charged up on credit cards we don't have you know a lot of money going out
 	
 	
 		right
 		i think that's great
 	
 	
 		uh than what we can pay for but i think if you do have a budget at least then maybe you'll have extra money sitting around that you can invest more in or do some other things that are a little bit more important
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i didn't used to have uh a money allotted out for debt service until um i just had a baby <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven months ago</TIMEX> and she had extensive problems and
 		and  the the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> that she had to have you know uh she was in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> for like a month and the money that accumulated in those i found i had to make
 		that into the budget to start paying those off and then i mean the insurance
 	
 	
 		oh isn 't that something
 	
 	
 		pardon
 	
 	
 		i say isn't that something about medical bills golly
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i know just one little one little hiccup
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		will just about devastate you
 	
 	
 		our insurance was wonderful but it didn't cover everything you know and so
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah fine you have to um do some of those things and and when money is involved it can really get expensive
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		so anyway that's about how we handle our finances and and uh that seems to work pretty well for us
 	
 	
 		yeah i keep pretty extensive records on on you know what i do and i average out you know utilities and things like that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i i project ahead i usually at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the month</TIMEX> when i when i pay the bills i'll usually
 		project what i'm going to need for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next month</TIMEX> but i don't really put it aside i just you know i just try to estimate what i think it's going to come to and then
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well see even that i think is a sort of uh a budget uh when you do that right right
 	
 	
 		in some basic sense but i think a planned budget i think is is a real good idea so you just break it down in little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subgroups</ENAMEX> and then you have <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">X</NUMEX> number of dollars what you think is adequate to pay those bills
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		now do you save all your receipts
 	
 	
 		i do we used to it got to be a great big hassle great big mess and i i just don't do that so what i have is uh a paper and uh and i put <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> columns my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> side and me on the other side
 		uh we pay for check or else we take out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATM</ENAMEX> services you know a certain amount of money and i write every check down
 		for the amount of money or whoever takes money out of the ATM i write down that amount of money and as it comes through uh on on the statement
 		then i'll block block it off in in a bright color so we know it's gone and i can see what's left out and what's left over to come through the statement to make sure that we don't overdraw ourselves or anything
 		but uh that's the way i do it uh receipts were a big mess for me i can't do that
 		that was just uh too much
 	
 	
 		boy i know with that you receipts for everything
 	
 	
 		yeah i couldn't do that so
 	
 	
 		are you are you like a coupon saver too for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> and things
 	
 	
 		oh yeah oh yeah
 	
 	
 		you know i've i've noticed that's a big deal i i have i save every coupon i get my hands on
 	
 	
 		i just uh they are such a boon to of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">housewives</ENAMEX> i i can't tell you
 	
 	
 		hey i mean i know it's it's easy to to get hooked on that stuff because i i
