 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		all right uh how long have they been recycling there in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um actually quite a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a</NUMEX> a while um i've lived here for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six years</TIMEX>
 		and  can you hold on just a second
 	
 	
 		yeah um-hum
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">hello</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh i'm sorry i must have got the other line cut off um
 		so they've been doing that it for a while now
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and um it i live in an apartment
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment  facilities</ENAMEX> there it is hold on
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		have some problem with the phone huh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">hello</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		okay sorry about that
 	
 	
 		yeah okay you're okay
 	
 	
 		yeah um
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		um anyhow they have <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> here in my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment complex</ENAMEX> for recycling paper only um i've been recycling for maybe <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about two years</TIMEX> now and
 		at another another another public <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> where they have you know recycling of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glass um aluminum</ENAMEX> and paper
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh</ENAMEX> have you have you cycled <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plastic</ENAMEX> recycled plastic also
 	
 	
 		now
 		no and that's what i i don't understand exactly why they don't have that option
 	
 	
 		we we have out here uh up until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">just this last year</TIMEX> in on you are <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> there wasn't any really good way they had some bends around that we could find and put them in but
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		not all that many it wasn't very well advertised but recently uh the refuse <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> has has uh is working on getting a system going where we will actually have uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		a bend that we put things in for recycling these other things
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so it it should be good uh i think it's a marvelous idea when you think of uh when i just think of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX> that i dump out
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i mean there just it's such a i waste i just hate to think about it
 	
 	
 		yeah now an additional thing is um where i work
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		they also have recycling there of um all white paper and of you know cans also
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so because i mean a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> you know right at the vending machines they have receptacles
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		that you know you can just pop your  cans in and near the  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xerox</ENAMEX> machines they have places you know for your paper you know i keep a uh little  box at my desk
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know and i just throw as i'm using the white paper you know i just throw it right in there and then you know they have someone that comes around and pick it up you know every <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah all that's neat
 	
 	
 		which you know is an excellent idea at work because i know the amount paper they go through there because
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah that's right i guess one of the things i think that needs to happen is we need to be better informed about
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		about it there's needs to be more public uh service of programs or something that would let us know had a happens to it and helps us to become enthused about it because of what is happening
 	
 	
 		yeah i would agree with that
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		um-hum right
 	
 	
 		and there's i've seen a few things but not very much really and i i think that's a shame they need to uh do a little more i'd like to know for instance when i when they say uh plastic
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		all plastic what kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plastic</ENAMEX> can you put all together or is there some reason not to uh now maybe they just sort it after they get it and throw out what they can't use i don't know
 	
 	
 		exactly uh-huh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but i i'd be glad to
 		organize it  if that they'd tell me what it is i'm doing
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		right
 	
 	
 		because that would that would be really helpful
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah yeah i agree with you there another thing that i like here which is i do with i have to actually go to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different recycling areas because
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of them is that um their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aluminum</ENAMEX> cans is for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">um Children's Hospital</ENAMEX> for a burn fund
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so all the monies are donated you know for the recycling to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Children's Hospital</ENAMEX> which i think is an excellent idea there you know because the other public
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum that's great
 		now that gives you a little bit of incentive there uh-hum
 	
 	
 		right right and before even at work before they started the recycling plan which at work they've only been doing since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January first of this year</TIMEX> i had had everyone in my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> recycling and you know i would have them drop
 	
 	
 		swing them for you huh
 	
 	
 		right drop their cans off in my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> and then i would haul them you know here to this place for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Children's Hospital Fund</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		which got <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> really going into it but
 	
 	
 		i think that's right i think i think helping us be more enthusiastic enthusiastic about it helping us maybe maybe using the money for something special that would be
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		like paying off the national debt
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		that there there you go
 	
 	
 		making sure
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that's for sure
 	
 	
 		but i i think that's right i think they there needs to be a little bit more in the area of of uh
 		advertisement advertisement and  letting public letting you understand more of what it is you're doing why you're doing it how you're it's done and what what happens to it because i think that's that would help a lot
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		right right
 		um-hum and i'm sure you know in the near future i would think they would be coming out with more you know i've seen a definite trend you know towards more recycling everywhere you know even at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McDonald's</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know with their their use of no foam containers anymore
 	
 	
 		yes i i i'm glad to see some of these things i think
 	
 	
 		right i think i think it is getting more you know advertisement
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are becoming more conscience all the time that it's necessary to do and that we need to
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		somehow get away from the fact that we have to have everything individually wrapped and all these things that i think that's true
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		right
 	
 	
 		well i think i'm that's about my uh  some on recycling but i i enjoyed talking to you
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		okay well i did too
 	
 	
 		uh-huh all right bye now
 	
 	
 		okay bye-bye
