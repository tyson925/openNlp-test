 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh
 		the clothing i guess that uh i wanted to talk about is the different uh
 		uh types of wardrobe that one might need to have
 		in the kind of job or well i think that you probably have a full-time job if you're a college student
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		a full-time do you consider that full-time
 	
 	
 		i consider a full-time college <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> i don't consider it really a job but i guess in a way it would be  i never really thought about it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well do you um
 		do you have a kind of wardrobe i suppose you do that is suitable for almost all <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> or do you change quite a bit during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the seasons</TIMEX>
 		
 
 	
 	
 		um
 		oh my everyone pretty much
 		well like in the winter everyone more more susceptible to the sweatshirts and you know the big heavy sweaters
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and basically everyone wears jeans but in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX> everyone's basically in shorts and sometimes we still do wear sweatshirts with our shorts you know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		sure
 	
 	
 		so um
 		i would just say the only difference is you know like long sleeve and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">short sleeve</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between summer</TIMEX> and winter
 	
 	
 		yes
 		yes um what year are you in college
 	
 	
 		i'm a senior
 	
 	
 		okay well uh what i might uh suggest since i have had a working career at the present time i'm not working
 		but it was so helpful to me you do plan probably to work when you receive your degree
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		yes  and what are you receiving it in
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">finance</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">finance</ENAMEX> well my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> is a financial person
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh but when i worked i tended to uh be confused a lot at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> and tried i would get things out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">closet</ENAMEX> and
 		oh that wouldn't do and this wouldn't do i just seemed to have more clothes than i could wear
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		or that i wanted to wear
 		and i went and had that uh <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Color Me Beautiful</ENAMEX> thing done
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 		and uh in fact i did it really that part just for fun because i have gotten her book before are you aware aware of that book
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well it uh tells you what colors really are best on you
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh what season you are <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter spring</TIMEX> you you heard <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> talk about that
 	
 	
 		yeah um i've had one of those things done for like makeup and stuff
 	
 	
 		okay Well i did it uh primarily for clothing because
 		um i have dark hair and kind of sallow reddy complexion and um those beige good looking cashmere beige suits that i wanted so badly were horrible on me
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and so when i got this color test done for clothing i found out that that's probably the worst color i can wear
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so i started buying only those colors that were good for a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> and i'm a winter
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and um so after about uh and and i was working and i added a few things to my wardrobe
 		uh in the colors that i out that i already to the colors that i already had that i could wear plus i bought some and do you know it made traveling and working so much more simple
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		because and i i did away with all those colors that like the beige <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blouses</ENAMEX> i couldn't wear i can wear white but i couldn't wear beige
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so i got rid of all those i mean i hated to get rid of those suits and pantsuits that were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred</NUMEX> and fifty
 	
 	
 		
 
 		knowing how much money you spent on them
 	
 	
 		really but i didn't look <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> would say have you been feeling well lately when i would wear those beige
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		suits
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so it made it so much more simple for me to have everything pretty much in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> color family For instance i wear burgundy well
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh purple and hot pinks well very often those can be combined combined and navy blues and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so when i travel for a week i really would only have to take one pair of shoes a suit several blouses an extra shirt or two
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and it was so much simpler if you will think about that
 	
 	
 		yeah well see um i'm i'm a cool <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> they call they and they i think that's relates to the same thing as the winter
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX> is the warmer colors and i i pretty much wear the same colors you just described i wear a lot of navy blues
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um i wear a lot of like a magenta or a hot pink color you know and and in those shades
 	
 	
 		yes exactly
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um i wear a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">greens</ENAMEX> though too
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know just the the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">darker greens</ENAMEX> i don't like wearing the light greens
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh black and maroon and you know i wear the darker colors yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yes
 		well <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">now</TIMEX> when you start have you started interviewing for jobs yet
 	
 	
 		no i haven't
 	
 	
 		um well when you start interviewing for jobs and if you do put in some quite a bit of money in your clothing
 		keep that in mind because those those pieces of clothing will do you probably for several years
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i already started buying suits and i've already you know i've bought the suits that i always wear colors in so
 	
 	
 		yeah uh-huh uh-huh well that's that's very smart
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		well i i have we exhausted our subject
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i've talked so much why don't you uh uh
 		tell me uh what kind of if you had an interview <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX> what would you probably wear
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		what would i wear
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i have um this suede suit it's a double breasted coat with a skirt
 		and i have a number of different blouses i could wear with it one blouse that looks really nice with it is a real deep red blouse
 	
 	
 		uh-huh sounds pretty
 		well i read an article in the uh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Charlotte</ENAMEX> paper <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> from one of the fashion <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> here
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		who said that stockings
 		um are also not given enough emphasis uh it choose we don't choose them
 		uh quite so well and it says that suntan really doesn't g o with everything
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and try to get one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> uh where you buy uh nice stockings to tell you the color to wear with outfits
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh
 		uh in fact she doesn't give white a real high grade
 	
 	
 		no i don't even wear white stockings with this just because it's just too much white with the white shoes and everything
 	
 	
 		it's too white isn't it
 		yes
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh i</ENAMEX> wear i wear the tan
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know or the nude or whatever you want to call it yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah or i think uh i don't know what is that a white white suit or is it a kind of creamy white
 	
 	
 		it's really different it's not quite it's it's not what you would call really an off-white and it's i don't think it's a real
 		white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">white</ENAMEX> either you know
 	
 	
 		well it probably looks good on you then but since it's not very off-white
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		well anyway i thought that i it was the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time i had ever read an article on stockings or or panty hose or whatever you call them <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these days</TIMEX> and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but it did say that uh
 		uh they really pretty much needed to be uh they need to look good with uh
 		the skirt and the shoes and you count you think of it as a total outfit
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but it said also they find that navy skirt and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">navy</ENAMEX> stockings and navy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shoes</ENAMEX> are very boring
 	
 	
 		yeah that would just be too much  oh gosh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		
  
 		well it's been fun talking to you
 	
 	
 		it was nice talking to you too
