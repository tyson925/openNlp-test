 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		nope
 	
 	
 		did i interrupt your reading schedule
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		been playing on my computer
 	
 	
 		oh oh
 	
 	
 		and
 	
 	
 		well have you what have you read good lately
 	
 	
 		um lately
 	
 	
 		well well not not even lately tell me
 	
 	
 		well uh let's see last book i read was a science fiction book called <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Weapon</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		who's it by do you remember
 	
 	
 		um uh it was it was his first book i think not very popular
 	
 	
 		yeah my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> is a big science fiction uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> but i don't uh care for it as much i don't have uh
 		he's a computer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> too so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i think that sometimes goes hand in hand
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah what books are you into
 	
 	
 		well uh i'm at a stand still right now but uh um we haven't lived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Charlotte</ENAMEX> very long
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and so uh and our furniture is stored somewhere else so i've had a lot of time i've read a lot of books
 		but and this is uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of books i'm wondering if you've read that i i guess i started reading them <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two or three years ago</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jean Auel</ENAMEX> uh the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> one was <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Clan of the Cave Bear</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		no i sure haven't read that
 	
 	
 		oh gosh that is wonderful
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and then the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> uh book of hers was <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Valley</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Horses</ENAMEX>
 		and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> one was the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mammoth Hunters</ENAMEX> are they sounding familiar
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and her last one which i think waited everybody waited <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about a year or two</TIMEX> for to come out
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh uh <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Plains</ENAMEX> of Passage
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		uh i think
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Clan</ENAMEX> and and you have to read them in order you have to read the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Clan</ENAMEX> first
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but that has that is the most different book that my i've read in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many many years</TIMEX> probably since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brave New World</ENAMEX> uh made such an impact on me <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many years ago</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		that's a good book
 	
 	
 		and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> says so too
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Clan</ENAMEX> so it's if you can pick those books up uh and sometimes they're packaged together those <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> in paper back
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		well the last good book i read would be uh let me think
 		uh the last series i read was
 		Power that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Preserves</ENAMEX> and have you ever read those by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Donaldson</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yes i have
 	
 	
 		yeah with the leper
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		good

 		but how do you uh read more realistic books perhaps
 	
 	
 		um what do you mean
 	
 	
 		self-improvement or yeah how-to books
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		lot of computer books i guess

 		artificial intelligence
