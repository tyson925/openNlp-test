 
     		
 	
 		
 
 		okay uh i really haven't thought about the topic of drug testing but uh just off the top of my head
 		i've i don't think i see much wrong with it um
 		if i owned a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> and i wanted to make sure that it was run smoothly and that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that i had uh coming in uh were trust worthy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et</ENAMEX> cetera and so on i think i would i would uh
 		probably do the random testing just to insure that my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> uh runs safely and smoothly
 	
 	
 		yeah um i i also haven't thought too much about it uh but i suspect it it it very much depends upon the job
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		maybe there are some jobs where i guess it doesn't really
 	
 	
 		hum
 		yeah that
 	
 	
 		i mean it's it's if if it's not affecting someone's performance i'm not sure if it's a problem
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		if if it's a position a a position where it could potentially affect
 	
 	
 		that's true i didn't think about that like for instance uh if someone's working on heavy machinery or uh say driving <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trucks</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">buses city buses</ENAMEX> or something like that
 	
 	
 		you know if if
 		right
 	
 	
 		then that is something that affects the affects then affects the community
 		you know if you're if you're drinking or on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> or whatever you're driving a city <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bus</ENAMEX> you taking several lives in your hands
 	
 	
 		that don't
 		right and then if you're a computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operator</ENAMEX> and uh there's really no big deal i think you know then then then maybe it's not
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		necessary
 	
 	
 		yeah for me i think that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> testing just it it follows the path that society's going in if more and more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> then i think that some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have to guard against <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that are using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i mean it's just it's just where society is right now and you know something we have to cope with and i think the drug testing is something that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> have to cope with
 	
 	
 		but
 		yeah well i think it it may i mean that in in in that respect i think it may help a lot i think it may be pushing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> away from hopefully push <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> away from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> use if they know that you know well if you use <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> you won't get this job i mean
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah yeah
 		i think that may be
 		yeah that may be one of the points of it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		of course i think um i'm not sure you know what the time span is but i mean if i think if i used <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX> and i had a you know had a job interview that i wouldn't use <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day before</TIMEX> or something and they wouldn't even see it
 		you know i'm saying they can't they may not be able trace don't know how far you trace i don't know what the you know limits are or whatever
 	
 	
 		yeah i don't know
 		i don't know the uh that that would actually be an interesting thing to find out i think i don't i don't actually know how long those things stay in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> in the system i've heard some you know you so some things supposedly stay for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six months</TIMEX> some stay for less some stay for longer i mean
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		they think <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSD</ENAMEX> i guess stay forever in in in some ways i mean if you get flashbacks for uh
 	
 	
 		hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		forever
 	
 	
 		oh really hum
 	
 	
 		i i i guess so
 	
 	
 		something like that yeah
 	
 	
 		i mean there must be some
 		some something i mean <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people people</ENAMEX> who <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> get these little little flashback things you know
 	
 	
 		um-hum hum
 	
 	
 		of some sort so i don't really know
 	
 	
 		yeah i mean i i don't use any <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> i don't really drink or anything so i'm pretty uh
 		
 
 		uh i guess decisive about that just the fact that you know if since i don't use <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> i have no problem with taking a test
 	
 	
 		right well the same here actually i don't use <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> at all and i and i'm at at most a social <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drinker</ENAMEX> so it's so it's never a problem
 	
 	
 		that just it yeah
 		yeah yeah um-hum
 		so the only thing i would hate is if i were to go and uh i mean it's kind of the same thing with the lie detector  the lie detector test
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		if you don't have anything to hide you're not going to mind it
 	
 	
 		um-hum right
 	
 	
 		you know but for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that
 		you know don't have anything to hide and then there are some things that just aren't <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>'s business you know that they come out at that point so i think a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have trouble with that
 	
 	
 		right that that that uh
 		that's a fine line to draw
 	
 	
 		and i can i can understand that um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		i mean uh that that's really you know do you uh
 		do you worry about you know this or that i mean you know what what what about their rights to privacy well if they're doing something illegal there they have a private you know like especially in in in the case of drinking you know if someone's
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		right
 	
 	
 		is something more than a social <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drinker</ENAMEX> shall we say yet they're not an alcoholic what do you do
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		i mean i i took a lie detector test once and it didn't i didn't mind it but i was just offended by some of the questions i guess i mean there was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> question do you like your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> you know i said yes do you hate your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> no have you ever killed your mother
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and i was just going you know what in the world
 	
 	
 		well those are just yeah those it turns out those are just to get a um probably to get some sort of
 		those are to get some shock value out of you or just to see what happens when you get shocked yeah there's uh um i do some i'm a student <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">graduate student</ENAMEX> in psychology
 	
 	
 		is that what it was i just
 		okay
 	
 	
 		and we sort of you know figure out um
 		i i know a a little bit uh about that kind of stuff and what they try and do there is they want to sort of get base line measures for you you know how is it that when when you see these things and you know and and and they can look at the lines and sort of sort of get an idea
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		hum
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		so it kind of get kind of get something to measure my responses by i guess
 	
 	
 		yeah otherwise they have no idea if you're just sort of jumping around and being fidgety and maybe they say that you would sort of it can be shocking and it they want to see how easy it is shock you
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 		they ask that i was going what in the world are you asking me about here you know it's just
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but i guess i don't know some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> probably have killed their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> i don't know but
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah well i guess so i mean i guess i don't i don't what happens actually actually happens if uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		if you have killed your mother
 	
 	
 		yeah it's like i
 	
 	
 		you get a big a big jump there you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but yeah it's i think it's their way of seeing how how how well you do in a shock situation without worrying abo ut you know stuff like that so
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		hum
 		hm okay i never thought about that and that makes me feel a little better  of course that was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX> and also i don't
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah and i don't think that you killed your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> though i wouldn't worry about that
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i don't think that some thing i mean there are some people
 		i mean because society a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are taking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> there is also <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that are getting off <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> and trying to do better with their lives
 		but they take a lie detector test or a drug test or whatever
 		and the stuff that happened to them you know <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five years ago</TIMEX> comes up and it spoils their chances for just making it a little better you know when they might be actually trying to improve their lives you know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah that's uh you know it it it it could blow things right away for them you know unless they say well look i mean unless they walk it won't
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i'm thinking walk in and say look i did do <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> you know <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year ago</TIMEX> and i'm off them for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> now and this and that and so if you take if i take i'll be happy to take the test but it will show up positive of course i think
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah yeah i would probably do that and i'd probably bring something in showing that i had been to such and such <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> for help or you know whatever the twelve month program or whatever it is that that they do
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah because then i mean then although legally they can't discriminate you i think on the basis but i'm not sure
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but i don't i don't really know i don't know what the laws are pertaining to this my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> probably does but
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		i'm not sure what they are either
 	
 	
 		i don't i don't of this stuff
 	
 	
 		but
 	
 	
 		but yeah it's it's it's it's an interesting topic that they've actually thought about your right in that it doesn't
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah i <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the other day</TIMEX> we had talked about uh
 		capital punishment
 	
 	
 		oh i
 	
 	
 		and i really i really hadn't thought uh thought about it i mean i think about it because i hear about it
 		but i hadn't sit had to sit down and and say well what do i think about it  you know and that's kind of like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> i'm not real sure what i think about it i'm kind of you know in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">in the middle</TIMEX> on that one
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah well these these are tough i i sort of like this it makes you think
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		um-hum um-hum really really
 	
 	
 		so i think that's that's real good
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
