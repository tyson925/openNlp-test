 
     		
 	
 		i don't guess we got our <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> uh credit card oh back in the seventies early seventies uh when i <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> got married was a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Visa</ENAMEX> card uh issued out of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Liberty Bank</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oklahoma City</ENAMEX> because my
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> worked at the uh
 		uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Visa  Bank</ENAMEX> Americard
 		center there so we were still in college and had she not worked there i'm not sure that i would have qualified
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 	
 	
 		they've come in handy over the years
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> and they have become or
 		also a
 		a real bother sometimes
 	
 	
 		oh tell me about it
 	
 	
 		especially you know if you catch yourself short on cash or if you're on vacation it's just easier to put everything on a card
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh i find if you're not careful you wind up uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a month</TIMEX> or so
 		staring those bills in the face and you go i don't remember doing all that stuff and it adds up
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah they add up quick
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so sometimes uh especially traveling with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> you know everything goes on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Express</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and it makes it a whole lot easier for bookkeeping
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh as far as personal life goes i guess i really try to use them as little as possible uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i kind of like having them for uh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gasoline</ENAMEX> purchases
 	
 	
 		yeah we like to keep <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> on hand just for emergencies you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but
 	
 	
 		but other than that uh i i guess over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</TIMEX> tried to avoid the national credit card syndrome of just putting everything on there day after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX> and then then you really get socked to it if you don't watch it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		how how do you
 		look at credit credit cards
 	
 	
 		we just uh quit using them  and they got us in trouble we took a loan and paid them all off
 	
 	
 		that's
 	
 	
 		we keep them uh we keep uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> gas card and uh and uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Visa</ENAMEX> just you know in case there's an emergency or something but other than that we don't use them anymore
 	
 	
 		right
 		well that's kind of the way we were coming it's it's uh i guess for that very reason that that uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		if you're not real conscious of what you're doing
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 		it's just too much by the time you get well if you got a bunch of cards you get a bunch of bills <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every month</TIMEX> and for some strange reason those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> think they need to get paid
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		i know isn't that funny
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and i give them maybe not maybe they're not really concerned about getting paid because they're know if you don't then they're adding on what <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">eighteen nineteen twenty percent</ENAMEX> sometimes it's <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty two</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">percent</NUMEX> interest
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		yeah yeah and then some of them add late fees on it and say they don't get paid and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i guess that's one of the motivations behind the the uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		huh
 	
 	
 		the uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Express</ENAMEX> card with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> there's no with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Express</ENAMEX> card from <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> there's no um
 	
 	
 		huh
 		uh uh
 	
 	
 		late fee there's no uh interest rate you either you either pay the thing off or they come get it
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and it's turned into <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> and they come get you
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		so they've got quite a bit more motivation i think to get paid then
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		then some of the others do
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but that's the one that your cost <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">center manager</ENAMEX> sees every month
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so you're
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		a little bit more careful about what you put on that even though you can use it however you want to
 	
 	
 		
 
 		can you use that one for personal use
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		oh you can
 	
 	
 		you can use it like any other card
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		oh i see huh
 	
 	
 		but it you know you kind of you know that somebody <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every month</TIMEX> and who knows how many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are looking at those uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bills</ENAMEX> that come in and those statements you're not the only one
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so
 		you uh you want to make sure that
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> is that okay is that okay okay that those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> see what it is that you are buying and most of the time it is
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but most of the others i've sent back i mean all you get is card offers i've got <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">card</ENAMEX> offers now uh from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> and uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Visa Gold</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh some other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX> uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Citibank</ENAMEX> i think is always sending the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Visa</ENAMEX> stuff out
 		and i usually just throw them away because i you know
 	
 	
 		oh i do too i don't even open them much i throw them out
 	
 	
 		i don't want another one i don't want to have to mess with it you know you carry around a wallet full of
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		credit cards and uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these days</TIMEX> it's going to all be full
 	
 	
 		a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girlfriend</ENAMEX> of mine found uh uh it was a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Visa</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MasterCard</ENAMEX> she found the ad for one in like a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Good Housekeeping Housekeeping</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eleven</NUMEX> percent
 	
 	
 		oh that's not bad
 	
 	
 		so i said shoot i need one of those
 	
 	
 		yeah no if they don't say no <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> membership on them i'll throw them away um
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX> well that i had my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Visa</ENAMEX> card through this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oklahoma City</ENAMEX> for
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh probably fifteen <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> and then they star ted charging uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> membership fees
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i said adios i'm you know i'm not paying you
 	
 	
 		why do they do that
 	
 	
 		it's just another way to make money as far as i can tell i mean they've been
 	
 	
 		i mean
 		i mean they get enough you know on the interest
 	
 	
 		well sure
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and they i guess they figure they've got enough <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> out there with cards they're going to get cards at uh twenty bucks a pop
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		there's going to be that much more
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh so then <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple years ago</TIMEX> i found uh a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX> here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Plano</ENAMEX> that if you kept a minimum balance in any kind of account whether it was a savings account or what it was you can get a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Visa</ENAMEX> card through them and no <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> membership
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so i went over and just stuck <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">three hundred dollars</NUMEX> in my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX>'s savings account in his name and
 		got my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Visa</ENAMEX> card so as long as they have no <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> membership fee i it would be okay but i can't see paying someone to use their card be charged that eighteen percent interests
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		huh
 		no i can't either
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so yeah i think you're right the best philosophy is have them if you need them but otherwise leave them tucked away somewhere
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah really  gets a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in in trouble
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah it sure does maybe they're counting on that i don't know
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well i guess that's it thanks for talking
 	
 	
 		okay nice talking to you bye-bye
 	
 	
 		bye
