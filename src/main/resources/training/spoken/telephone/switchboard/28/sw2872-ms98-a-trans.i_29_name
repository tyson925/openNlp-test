 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		perhaps uh
 		maybe we were a little unsure because we were looking at something broader
 		you know nationwide worldwide or something maybe we should look city wide
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		you know or school <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> wide or you know what i'm saying narrow the topic a little and see if if we don't uh recognize some trends there
 	
 	
 		oh
 		okay okay
 	
 	
 		um one thing that i definitely have noticed in our area as far as the school system at least uh
 		token wise  i'm not sure that uh really truly uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh we're effectively counting but at at least for a show we're involving more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> in input and
 	
 	
 		more <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> input
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum um like i say this all may be in name only
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		kind of thing at this point but at least it's a step in the right direction i think
 	
 	
 		well do you have school age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> school age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh so you're you're definitely more
 		involved at least in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> school system my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> are grown so
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		well we uh
 		we try to keep abreast of it
 		uh of some of the things that are that are going on and
 		we've uh
 		we've just gone through some <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> elections here in in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Plano</ENAMEX> for our city council
 	
 	
 		for city council do you all have a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mayor</ENAMEX> or
 	
 	
 		yes yes
 	
 	
 		you do yeah we we do in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Houston</ENAMEX> too
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh uh-huh Whitmire</ENAMEX> is is she still the
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah she's still she's still there but it looks like uh she may have some
 		the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">opposition</ENAMEX> or they're they're trying to beat them she's been in for so long so we may hear some interesting things about her before election time comes up
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		this time but she's uh uh
 		okay i don't know is  would a trend does it seem to be we're having more minority type <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people women</ENAMEX> in government
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		as far as in the local like our  our our our our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief of police</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> our our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mayor</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">superintendent superintendent</ENAMEX> of of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> she's just now you know
 		been pushed out
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but i don't know if you would consider that a trend or not
 	
 	
 		oh i definitely think it's a trend uh you know <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this morning</TIMEX> on the way to school we just uh
 		it just so happened that we saw a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">buses</ENAMEX> and
 		i usually don't have all my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bus</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> at once but i'd taken them all to the chiropractor this morning <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> big fell swoop and then we were going on to school but just a tad late long enough for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">buses</ENAMEX> to be going back and
 	
 	
 		you
 		uh
 	
 	
 		the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> said gosh look how many of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bus</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drivers</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> and i said you know that really is a good indication of some of the jobs that have been
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know that trend that has swung you know one profession that you know there are a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> now and i think it's good because
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> sometimes pick up on those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> emotional needs and
 		might you know be aware of those things coming or going from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> where maybe the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> don't always you know they're just there to drive the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bus</ENAMEX> you know and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> are more
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well i saw uh the the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">superintendent</ENAMEX> that we've had was being considered for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">superintendent</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX> area
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and they just she just lost out to someone from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> area like assistants somebody who's an one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assistants</ENAMEX> in your i'm not sure what the name maybe it was another woman
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		must have been from uh DIS
 	
 	
 		maybe so yeah maybe so
 	
 	
 		but i definitely think think that administratively in the schools <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> are
 		are a show of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> now that we did not see even
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five years ago</TIMEX>
 		certainly not you know <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten years ago</TIMEX> up to that point they were allowed to be <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers secretaries nurses</ENAMEX>
 		so forth even your uh heads of uh
 		you know like your food services that kind of thing
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		your your deans you know they weren't women
 		um you know that's
 	
 	
 		lots of school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principals</ENAMEX> seem to be <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> in the at least in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Houston</ENAMEX> area
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		i've noticed over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">over the years</TIMEX> that my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> were in school
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX> more and more
 	
 	
 		fact i don't even remember any
 		uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> that they went to that there there wasn't a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> principal from elementary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> on up
 	
 	
 		on
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh that's excellent excellent you know that they're getting a chance
 	
 	
 		so
 		yeah but but then again you know it would be nice to have more you know the majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX>
 		seem to be <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> it would be nice to have but the problem is the pay scale probably it's because
 		you know <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> go into teaching probably not so much for the money but uh
 		for the satisfaction and that's just what they want to want to do whereas uh i think if you're a college professor
 	
 	
 		the type of uh
 	
 	
 		probably the pay is much better and you tend to see more i think you see more
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		well i don't know it seems like there there are a lot of a lot more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> at least in the the college level so
 	
 	
 		well and that comes once again you know is that you can teach in elementary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> you can even substitute in elementary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> without a
 		uh without a certificate
 	
 	
 		you can teach
 	
 	
 		yes you can substitute teach without a certificate or a degree
 	
 	
 		substitute
 		right
 	
 	
 		and then you know work on that and if you want to work on up but you still can make good money you know
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		part-time part-time money as a substitute whereas you know to teach on college level you have to have a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">PhD</ENAMEX> almost always sometimes you can get by on a fellowship program or something where you might be teaching but
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		do you do you have any idea how much uh uh a substitute <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> would make per day i'm sure they pay them by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the day</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh</ENAMEX> here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Plano</ENAMEX> they pay <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about fifty dollars</NUMEX> a day
 	
 	
 		well i mean that's good part-time money
 	
 	
 		that's good part-time money for but it's not career money
 	
 	
 		yeah but it's not
 		no
 	
 	
 		you know but it uh
 	
 	
 		course it you know
 	
 	
 		you know for a part-time situation
 	
 	
 		just somebody
 	
 	
 		and once you've gotten your foot in the door for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several years</TIMEX> substituting and then take on a degree
 		you know you're pretty well assured of a of a job in the system eventually
 		that you know that you've been subbing in a lot of times you know i think that's uh
 		i think uh one thing that uh
 		that we're seeing you know a trend in uh politics is
 		that our <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> are taking a lot more responsibility for uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> becoming involved in the environment uh
 	
 	
 		yes it's true
 	
 	
 		recycling uh clean up programs refurbishing you know historical and and uh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">park</ENAMEX> land
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um
 		your uh city you know where they they adopt a highway kinds of things those are becoming more and more
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		government uh originated
 		and not just private enterprise
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know generated
 	
 	
 		which i think is something that has to happen in order to
 	
 	
 		to make <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> do it probably
 	
 	
 		to make it happen right
 	
 	
 		which you know i thought <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> would be the last place to ever
 		um
 		get <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to do those things voluntarily and i think their don't mess with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> campaign has been very effective because <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Texans</ENAMEX> don't like to be told what to do they're very proud of their state
 		so they've
 		psychologically they've done a number on us there
 	
 	
 		well <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple weeks ago</TIMEX> i was at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Houston</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">International Festival</ENAMEX> which is you know in the downtown <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">area</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> of mine that was with me uh commented on on how clean
 		uh you know when you have an event like that of course everybody you know there's just food and everything else and of course they have the the you know the places to throw the stuff but you really they were really use they really use it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		because in the past you know it seemed like i can remember <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> just just throw it down they don't care but you're you're finally getting to the point where it's just kind of <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> nature to find some place to to throw it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX>  can you remember driving down the highway i could as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX> you know you just get rid of it you roll the window down and you throw it out but you wouldn't
 	
 	
 		well my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> was always real picky about that kind of thing i think i'd probably have my fingers cut off if i'd ever thrown out a candy wrapper or anything but
 	
 	
 		well you're probably younger than i am because i you know um but i can remember
 		uh
 		probably probably uh in the early seventies uh going out on you know taking our <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> out and stuff like that and looking for places for trash bins and stuff and that was very new at that time you know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		um-hum that that
 	
 	
 		so it's uh yeah it really hasn't been that long i mean it's probably <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty years</TIMEX> or so that you know it really began
 	
 	
 		yes yes
 	
 	
 		so yeah
 	
 	
 		i agree for it to and to be adopted and funded
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> and you think the incredible amount of
 		you know money that we vote for our <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> to spend on these kinds of things so
 		you know it's definitely uh you know you have to consider that a political trend because we're the ones voting for those people
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know to that are in favor of those kinds of programs and make them you know campaign issues
 	
 	
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		how about the representation that you have on the city council is it
 		uh you know we're we're i think we're to vote going to have increased the number so that we will be able to represent uh like the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican Americans</ENAMEX> don't feel like they've had enough representation and stuff like that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well of course <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> is in a great upheaval right now over the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fourteen one and ten four one</NUMEX>
 		you know programs and it's you know going back and forth between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX> to you know
 	
 	
 		what is that i'm
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		have to be plead ignorant here
 	
 	
 		the um
