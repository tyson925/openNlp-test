 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so do you do any of your own repairs or maintenance work
 	
 	
 		well i do a little bit i just do mainly you know change the oil and uh i'll do an occasional tune-up things like that change set of disc brakes
 		but most of the stuff i have done i just don't have time to fool with it or you know it's just out of my technical expertise
 	
 	
 		yeah do you have like an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> or foreign car
 	
 	
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of each
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		a foreign and uh and i have a a truck
 	
 	
 		because i know like i've got a a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Honda</ENAMEX> and and it's just beyond even my my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX>'s and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>'s comprehension a lot of that stuff they grew up with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Americans</ENAMEX>
 		little simpler arrangements on under the hood so so they'll change the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> for me and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um
 		that's about it these days
 	
 	
 		yeah i don't work on anything foreign
 	
 	
 		yeah it's it's
 	
 	
 		well you've got to have a different set of tools for it and everything else too so
 	
 	
 		you have to have metric don't you
 	
 	
 		yeah metric well even even some <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> have that now but uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh they're still a little bit over all simpler you know to work on but uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i feel like if if i can afford to have it done i'm going to have it done
 	
 	
 		well it's it's a lot easier than getting under there and finding out something major
 		has happened that you didn't know about and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Advanced Auto</ENAMEX> closed <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">fifteen minutes ago</TIMEX> and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		getting into that kind of hassle
 	
 	
 		well have you had anything done to yours lately or
 	
 	
 		yeah i had um well i was having problems with the cruise control
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so i had to take it down and have them look at that and they said it was something with the um
 		the way the choke was adjusted
 	
 	
 		yeah automatic choke
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		how much did that cost you to have that fixed
 	
 	
 		well i had the um like the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">sixty thousand mile</NUMEX> tune-up done at the same time
 		so the whole thing was like <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">two hundred dollars</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		not cheap like it used to be
 	
 	
 		no it i mean the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time i found out how much it was going to be i about fell over
 	
 	
 		yeah i've had uh we have a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Volvo</ENAMEX> and uh i had some steering problems
 	
 	
 		but
 	
 	
 		and it ended up being the entire rack and pinion steering assembly
 	
 	
 		holy cow
 	
 	
 		and by the time i got everything done
 		it was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">twelve hundred</NUMEX> bucks
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		
 
 		so something something that small and that minor uh well it's not really minor but something that small can cost that much money
 	
 	
 		was it is it a fairly new car i mean was it
 	
 	
 		well it's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five years old</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		well that's still
 	
 	
 		but
 		but still it doesn't have that many miles it's got uh <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">just over sixty five thousand miles</NUMEX> on it and rack and pinion steerings
 		uh i don't think i've ever heard of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> going out
 	
 	
 		i know i haven't the the little bit i know about <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> i've never heard of anybody having that happen to them
 	
 	
 		the uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> that i talked to that replaced it he said i just he said we've never really had to replace one
 		we've had to go in and do some adjustments but never replace <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> but the actual gear teeth on this one had had broken
 	
 	
 		man
 	
 	
 		so i think it was a defect defect and i tried to get the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Volvo Corporation</ENAMEX> to cover it but they just refused to do it
 	
 	
 		did they
 	
 	
 		so i just rather than get tied up in in a bunch of you know garbage i just went ahead and and got it done and and to heck with it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh and then the the truck i have i have uh
 		i've had just virtually excellent luck with it and other than taking in for just regular warranty work and things like that it's it's been a real good truck
 	
 	
 		well i've the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> i've had i had a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Honda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Civic</ENAMEX>
 		and it was let's see uh
 		i'm trying to think
 		how old it was i got it in
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eighty one</NUMEX> and got rid of it in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eighty eight</NUMEX> so it was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven years old</TIMEX> and had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost a hundred thousand</NUMEX> miles on it
 	
 	
 		they're good cars
 	
 	
 		yeah and i i mean i never had any problem with it and i've got an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Accord</ENAMEX> now and other than you know minor tune-ups like with the the choke and stuff i've never had any problem with it so i've been really lucky
 	
 	
 		i had a i had a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Honda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Accord uh</ENAMEX> it was uh
 		trying to think what year it was uh
 		i think it was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">an eighty eight or eighty seven eighty seven</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		mine's <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an eighty eight</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		it's the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">the</ENAMEX> was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LXI</ENAMEX> with the the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fuel</ENAMEX> injection is that what you have
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		no i've i've got the LX
 	
 	
 		i think it still has <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fuel</ENAMEX> injection there's i think the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DX</ENAMEX> is the one that does not
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		but uh they are probably one of the nicest running <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> i've ever driven
 		they run good and they're and they're peppy
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and this one's you said yours was just now about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixty five thousand</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mine</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an eighty eight</NUMEX> and it's it just turned over seventy thousand
 	
 	
 		yeah i i will i don't i don't think i'd ever buy another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Volvo i</ENAMEX> bought it mainly uh for my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> for safety more than anything and i thought well it'd be an investment we'll be able to keep it for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> or twelve years
 	
 	
 		so
 		yeah
 		sure
 	
 	
 		and uh i i don't think i'd buy another one only because the maintenance costs are very very high
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and that's just a little bit out of my range it's enough just to buy it without uh having the other problems but uh
 	
 	
 		once it
 	
 	
 		i will definitely go back go to uh
 		now go back to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Honda</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mazda</ENAMEX> or something like that next time
 	
 	
 		we've been looking recently just
 		you know mainly window shopping but um we've been thinking more <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> just
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		because we want a bigger car this time
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and we've been looking at um
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crown Victoria</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Grand Marquis</ENAMEX> and we're leaning a little bit towards
 		the uh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grand Marquis</ENAMEX> as far as just looks but my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> have a um <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Continental</ENAMEX> and they've had nothing but nightmares with that car
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		it's been it's been one thing after another going wrong that the local dealer
 		either says there's nothing wrong it's your imagination or says well it's supposed to be that way just get used to it it's been an absolute nightmare for them
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		so it kind of makes me dread going back to an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> manufacturer
 	
 	
 		that's been i think until they get the reliability up
 		i don't you know other than <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trucks</ENAMEX> i've had always had good luck with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trucks</ENAMEX> but with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> i i've not had much luck with uh <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> especially <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Motors</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh you know i look at reliability and and you know like stuff like tires and and belts and stuff like that uh actually
 		you can buy the parts cheaper for foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> if you buy them and put them in yourself
 	
 	
 		sure
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but if you have to have it done of course it ends up costing you the installation fee but
 		i have had if i had to say dollar for dollar spending on foreign and as opposed to to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> i spent far less on the foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		i believe that
 	
 	
 		long term a lot a lot more and then then you add the the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">fuel</ENAMEX> savings on top of it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so my money's on foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> until <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> until the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> can can meet the standards
 	
 	
 		i wish there were bigger foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> really it seems like they kind of
 	
 	
 		well that that's interesting that you say that because if you'll start looking now at some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hondas</ENAMEX> and some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mazdas</ENAMEX> and and a lot of the car <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> now are beginning to scale up you know like the the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lexus</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		really
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		see those <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> if if you'll go look at them they're as big as some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Motors</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i hadn't really even
 	
 	
 		if you if you put them side by side and i i didn't really notice it until someone pointed it out he says well if you'll look and see what's happening
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX>
 		are able to keep the same <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> or keep keep good gas mileage good reliability but they're scaling up whereas the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">now</TIMEX> are scaling down and they can't improve the gas mileage anymore
 		so the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> have have definitely beat us in both sides of the game
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		they they thought you know build them small cheap and you know and and little repair
 		and you know get them hooked and then start slowly adding stuff on
 	
 	
 		moving them up
 	
 	
 		and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> like the reliability but they also like the size and now they're sizing up they've got the reliability and they've got the gas mileage you know
 	
 	
 		and i don't i don't think <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> mind too much taking the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> in for a a tune-up
 		you know just general fifteen <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">thousand mile</NUMEX> maintenance or or even getting the oil changed if they know that they're not going to have any other major problems that they'll have to pay for on top of that
 	
 	
 		that's right and with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> and the warranties you don't know
 	
 	
 		what did they used to say <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> stood for fix or repair daily
 	
 	
 		yeah except i've got a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> truck
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and i know a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that have <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trucks</ENAMEX>
 		and really they're very maintenance free
 	
 	
 		well that's great
 	
 	
 		from i now i i i speaking only from trucks
 	
 	
 		i wonder why they can't extend the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">truck</ENAMEX>'s
 		you know reliability out to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> i mean i don't know
 	
 	
 		i don't know that's surprising surprising because you know everybody i know that has a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> has had nothing but trouble with it but they they have a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">truck</ENAMEX> and they're they're virtually uh flawless
 	
 	
 		that's weird
 	
 	
 		the uh the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the undercarriage</TIMEX> and everything else if you put them next to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chevy</ENAMEX> or or another type of truck
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">truck</ENAMEX> you can't even come close to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		and uh that's why i buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trucks</ENAMEX>
 		mine runs like a top it it i've like i say i've had absolutely nothing wrong with it other than taking it in for normal maintenance
 		and uh and i i put over a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">hundred miles</NUMEX> a day on it
 	
 	
 		man
 	
 	
 		and i've never i've never had trouble with it
 	
 	
 		that's great
 	
 	
 		so i'll buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trucks</ENAMEX> but i'll buy foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i think they need to uh take a look at and see what they can't figure out what the catch is there
 	
 	
 		i know it's it's it's kind of kind of crazy but i don't know but but until they until they meet the standards that you know that i'm used to anyway that you know i'll i'll buy what whatever i get you know that's best for my money
 	
 	
 		yeah and you know like i said i've had i've had great luck with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hondas</ENAMEX> and it's kind of hard to walk away from a good thing when it's you know you're not sure what you're going to get when you change
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		they're they're good <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> i i i will say that you probably made a good choice
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		in that one
 		but how about have you had tires changed on on that car
 	
 	
 		i had the um tires changed at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fifty two thousand</NUMEX> they had they had started to look to look pretty bald
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		did you put the same kind of tires back on it did you
 	
 	
 		no um let's see i had
