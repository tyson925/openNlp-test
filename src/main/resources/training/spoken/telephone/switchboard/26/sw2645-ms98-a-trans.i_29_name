 		uh
 		i saw <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7-Eleven</TIMEX> that was hiring
 	
 	
 		well i'm sure with the new uh awarding contract awarding i i think it went to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lockheed</ENAMEX> didn't it
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		that uh i hear they're hiring all over the place for that
 	
 	
 		yeah uh no <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX>'s coming to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> and and that has some opportunities and uh and
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		now is that actually just to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colorado</ENAMEX> or to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colorado Springs</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colorado</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Springs</ENAMEX> specifically yes
 	
 	
 		how about that
 	
 	
 		and uh and uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCI</ENAMEX>'s coming if if telemarketing is your bag personally i'd rather die a slow painful death but
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		were you in the uh computer operations or in the actual uh manufacturing
 	
 	
 		uh i'm a defense <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX> a government tool control specialist
 	
 	
 		right yeah that's why i was in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DSEG</ENAMEX> down here in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plano</ENAMEX> also
 	
 	
 		are you still employed
 	
 	
 		am i still employed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> no i took a leave of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">of TI</ENAMEX> back in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		actually <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December</TIMEX> was my <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">first month</TIMEX> away from them
 	
 	
 		exempt or <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hourly</TIMEX> oh yes
 	
 	
 		exempt
 		it uh uh fortunately i guess for myself it wasn't uh it was purely by my own choice
 		it wasn't uh there was no incentive for myself to leave but it was just an opportunity arose and decided to take it
 	
 	
 		oh so you didn't even get the severance package
 	
 	
 		
  
 		no i should have taken the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the the</TIMEX> you know uh option when that was there but it was just i missed it by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple months</TIMEX>
 		but you know what can one do i'm just happy to still to have a job
 	
 	
 		so are you happy with what you're doing now
 	
 	

 		yeah i am kind of happy with it it it's getting better all the time i knew it would be different from the very beginning but you know as as you get to know more of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that work there and more of what's going on with the system so i was in the computer operations
 		it's uh you know it all starts to become similar there's you know there's benefits and there's things that weren't as good but as an overall package i'd say i i'm pretty happy so far with the way it's turned out
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		good good well hasn't been a long time  <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> or i i'm
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		significantly shaken by the situation
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but not devastated
 	
 	
 		um-hum well the the one thing i guess at least in your favor is the the fact that that that is more in the support of the manufacturing and there's <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lots</ENAMEX> and lots of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> that have
 		maybe maybe not in the defense the defense area but manufacturing in general
 	
 	
 		tell you the truth i'm i'm i'm not really worried
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well that's great that's good
 	
 	
 		and and i seem rather happy about it most of the time just just to know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		what's
 		possibilities are you know what might happen
 	
 	
 		sure yeah sometimes it's good just to have everything out on the table
 	
 	
 		but
 		still in all
 	
 	
 		it may be a blessing in disguise
 	
 	
 		it feels funny
 	
 	
 		i know a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who are uh surplused and they're just actually what the positions that they've found outside of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> were much much better than the ones that they currently had inside
 	
 	
 		so
 		despite the fact that i should be tying flies or fly fishing or or going for walks in the mountains i can't seem to get into it right now
 	
 	
 		
 
 		exactly
 		uh-huh well i'm sure it's just with the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the the</TIMEX> the way that things are so topsy-turvy right now as soon as you decide decide on a pass
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> situational i i doubt i'll be here in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six months</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well would you like to be there
 	
 	
 		i
 		all things being equal yes
 	
 	
 		uh-huh what
 	
 	
 		but or or even somewhere better but
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		God this is much better than west <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">uh-huh</ENAMEX>  <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">well</ENAMEX> just take the day
 	
 	
 		but then they they tell me hell is much better than west <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		well actually uh the the the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Plano Dallas Houston</ENAMEX> you know <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Austin</ENAMEX> that whole area is is actually quite quite nice
 	
 	
 		i my little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> lives in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Austin</ENAMEX> right now
 	
 	
 		oh that's a beautiful place
 	
 	
 		goes to UT
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		that's just fantastic down there take it more as a this is your opportunity to do whatever you want pick out where you want to live and then once you pick that spot out pick out what you want to do
 	
 	
 		i
 		see that's the problem for the last <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many years</TIMEX> i've more or less let them direct what i want to do and where i want to go
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and just kind of go with the punches
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		and now i feel lost
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah that's a it it takes a bit of a shift doesn't it
 	
 	
 		oh i've had job offers
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but
 		i never found the one that was worth it for me to leave
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well the best thing about it is that you can uh try something if you don't like it shoot move on to something else that's the way i've uh looked at the whole thing here i'll take a chance if i don't like it i'll go someplace else do something different
 	
 	
 		and that
 		oh so had you been with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> long when you changed
 	
 	
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five years</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		well there's a noticeable difference there i've been with them sixteen
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i can imagine you know the longer and longer it goes
 	
 	
 		actually seventeen now and
 		oh yeah momentum is uh driving force in our lives
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but
 		so yeah i'm looking as as a opportunity
 	
 	
 		well that's good you've got a good attitude about it
 	
 	
 		and and i'm looking at it as
 		a change
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i'm looking at it as
 		as
 		an adventure
 	
 	
 		right there you go
 		that's the way to do it
 	
 	
 		and maybe i'll wet a fly line <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> and do some camping if i don't get laid off <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between now</TIMEX> and then
 	
 	
 		there you go that's the thing to do
 		that's much funner than doing any kind of job
 	
 	
 		huh how about we end this
 	
 	
 		that'll work out just fine
 	
 	
 		nice talking to you
 	
 	
 		all right nice talking to you good-bye
 	
 	
 		bye
