 
     		
 	
 		okay
 		do you exercise <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">every night</TIMEX> or not
 	
 	
 		no i do it in spurts
 	
 	
 		do you
 	
 	
 		yes and i've i should do it on a regular basis but uh for some reason i think it's tough to get into a a particular routine
 	
 	
 		yeah i i'm on uh a right now i'm on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of those jags where i i exercise at well i i run <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">every night</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		i just i was surprised i could run i didn't think i could i thought well i maybe a half a block i can run but i have really amazed myself but what i do i walk oh <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about a half a mile</NUMEX> and i walk uphill
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and then i run all the way back down by the time i get down to my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> i've worked up a pretty good momentum and i can just keep right on running until i get home
 		and uh i'm not right now i just got through doing it so i'm a little bit out of breath i'm really not as winded as i would thought thought i was going to be
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh a very appropriate topic then
 	
 	
 		yes sure it was fantastic i think gosh i just got back got in from running and i thought well i'll place this call real quick
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but i have a little <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> i run with so i'm and she's getting old i don't know if i probably not good for her but it's good for me
 	
 	
 		i think it's probably as good for her anyway
 	
 	
 		yeah i think so
 	
 	
 		they're they're natural i do a lot of uh hunting
 	
 	
 		oh do you
 	
 	
 		and have a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bird dog</ENAMEX> and i enjoy watching that dog run more than i do anything
 	
 	
 		yeah aren't they pretty i not
 	
 	
 		they are they're just beautiful and the native instinct that they have is just amazing to watch
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		is it a pointer or
 	
 	
 		it's a setter um-hum
 	
 	
 		setter yeah i think they're the prettiest
 	
 	
 		yeah that's a good combination pet and hunting <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> both
 	
 	
 		i had a a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Greyhound i</ENAMEX> was race i was running with but uh
 	
 	
 		oh my you are ambitious
 	
 	
 		he was i found i just i tried uh
 		i finally had to give her back to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Greyhound Association</ENAMEX> she was just too big for me she she weighed seventy pounds and uh
 		if she would run with me you know and stay with me but if she saw something she wanted if she wanted to get away she could have she would have drug me i mean when i walked with her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> you know would laugh because she drug me when i tried to walk
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and when i tried to run i was afraid she'd really take out running and just have and they can run i think uh <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">forty miles an hour</NUMEX> and uh gosh uh she got away from me a couple of times and
 		so i'd rather run with a little Pekingese <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">any old day</TIMEX>  they're my my more my style
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		are so you just run in your neighborhood
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i'm i'm too chicken to get out any place else

 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		because i i remember <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX> when i tried my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">side</ENAMEX> would hurt real bad and everything

 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i had a neighbor across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> that was going with me but she can't run because she said her ankles hurt or her knees or something and so i uh what i do i'll walk with her up the top hill and let her take my <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> and then i run home
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>

 		i would if i didn't have this radio on my head

 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh vitamin</ENAMEX> B6
