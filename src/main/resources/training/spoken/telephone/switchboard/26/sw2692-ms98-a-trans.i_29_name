 
     		
 	
 		are you a TIer
 	
 	
 		uh yeah i am yeah yeah i've been uh
 	
 	
 		oh good
 		yeah uh she had a hard time getting a few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX> uh i thought well every all these TIers have gone home uh at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one o'clock</TIMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		i uh it is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX> yeah that's for sure well uh i guess i'm trying to think the last thing i did to a car
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i i i do it a lot i have i kind of worked my way through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">college</ENAMEX> as a mechanic as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh wow okay
 	
 	
 		uh
 		so and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> were in it and and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX>'s still in it and i had periods when i didn't do anything but in the last <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten years</TIMEX> i've
 		uh my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> doesn't go to a shop you know it it i just do it all do i uh there's hardly anything that other than putting tires on that i'll do i did take it to a transmission place to put in a new transmission but i change the oil and transmission and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 		sure
 	
 	
 		uh uh i just essentially do it all i don't know uh
 		uh if there's anything specific in fact i could advise <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> uh i happen to be a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M E</ENAMEX> besides but i do it for fun really and to save money and i guess that's diversion uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		right right
 	
 	
 		i i've i've tried a few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> uh you know where you i can recommend it for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to take their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> Like i think <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sears</ENAMEX> is probably the best place because i've heard when i used to go there
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		and when i i just overheard what they did for me very little because i didn't take it that much but what i heard them tell other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> was always right
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know when i sat there i you know i dropped my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> off for tires or something like that
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and so i respect they seem to actually have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mechanics</ENAMEX> there
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		i was pretty impressed with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Western Auto</ENAMEX>
 		but they didn't do a great job of changing my transmission uh oil last time and when when i did it the next time i realized the filter was loose and everything and i didn't like it So i'm just doing it all myself i i
 	
 	
 		really
 		yeah that's that's the aggravating thing yeah i i try to do as much as i can i uh i grew up on farm so i've got that uh you know take care of yourself attitude and uh oh i've done
 	
 	
 		you had to do it yeah right
 	
 	
 		i've done various things i've got an i've got an <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eighty three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T Bird</ENAMEX> and i've i've changed out uh heater core and uh oh timing belts and things like that um
 	
 	
 		oh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um i guess the last thing i took
 		to anybody to have done was on my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>'s car um when we went in for inspection it didn't it didn't quite pass so we had to have uh that's uh that's a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mustang</ENAMEX> with a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">two barrel</NUMEX> carburetor on it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		they had to do some adjustments on that and of course it had never been adjusted so they had to pull it off and pull all the plugs out to get to it and uh
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		well you like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fords</ENAMEX> apparently huh
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i've uh i'm kind of stuck on them right now i guess but  you know that's it's partially because i can work on them that's uh that's that's that's a big part of my decision but uh yeah we ran into some problems with uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		having them to work on that carburetor i mean they get they got everything tuned up right you know but they we got i got it home and uh
 		and they had left the uh oil filter uh cap off and it was rubbing on a belt and it rubbed a notch in that little little things like that that really start to aggravate you that that's a lot of the reason i do my own stuff
 	
 	
 		really
 		my goodness
 		yeah i wonder always wonder when you have little things like that happen why even here at <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> why we don't inspect i'm in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> why we don't inspect areas and and guarantee it so to speak uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		we always fix things and  put things in and walk away we there needs to be a time of inspection and check out and and some thing like that with a car there ought to be someone there
 		that inspects it before it's turned there ought to be an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inspector inspector</ENAMEX> or quality insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> after after an oil change you know just in case uh they didn't put the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> in or whatever i i always wonder about that when when someone does repairs or little things like that uh
 	
 	
 		sure
 		sure that's right
 		sure yeah
 		any anything that gets that that's in uh
 		gets to be an an assembly line type operation you're you're always risking that if there's too many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that get their hands on one little project you know that things they're you get you you miss that overlap sometimes and and they miss things yeah i've i've had a hard time
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		finding anybody i can trust like like you say it
 		my old transmissions things like that i'm obviously i'm not going to i'm not going to tear apart a
 		automatic transmission try rebuild it
 	
 	
 		no no i don't either i don't either yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh it it's it's real stressful to try to find anybody that i think's going to do me right and and uh you know have an idea of what's going on
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		you need to really uh i i do uh a lot of the simple things i i think i do most of the things better than the average <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> you you have <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fords</ENAMEX> and i i uh i have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">Chevys</ENAMEX> which
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		okay
 	
 	
 		i worked my way into having the same engine i don't know how long i'm i like a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">V8</NUMEX> and i'm i'm sold sold on small block <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chevy</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V8s</ENAMEX> and i i bought <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> car new and i almost accidentally
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		got the next car although i was kind of looking for it when i got a used a used <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> with the same engine
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		well then the next the truck i got next i definitely looked for the same engine so i buy filters you know <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three or four</NUMEX> at a time and essentially the engines are different you the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> are different <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> but the same <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chevy</ENAMEX> V8
 	
 	
 		sure sure
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and the part the carburetors is the same almost everything is the same the the course is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> are eighties and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one eighty six</NUMEX> you know so you can learn a lot that way i there's no way i could i could fix every <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> in the world you know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		well yeah that that the biggest you know that's the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> biggest things to me you know i i number one you've got to have the tools around if you don't have the the special tools or
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		well any more the the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">testers</ENAMEX> that you know  i i don't have a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">forty thousand dollar</NUMEX> diagnostic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tester</ENAMEX> sitting in my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garage</ENAMEX> you know so obviously if it starts
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right
 	
 	
 		my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> start missing or something like that that it's almost impossible to track that down any more without a diagnostics but at the tools and the space to do it that that can be a big problem if it's if it's under carriage or something like that but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		then it's experience you know you can you can look through a a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chilton</ENAMEX>'s book or something like and get an idea of how to go about it but
 		you better figure on multiplying that time out about by at least by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five or so</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		just just just by not knowing you know how to get to that that one bolt or that one screw or whatever to get things apart
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that was that was the biggest thing when i did uh the heater core in my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T Bird</ENAMEX>
 		that is got to be the worst location for it and and the only reason i did it i
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i think they're all bad really they're
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah the the only ones i've ever heard good good things about are are the old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lincolns</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cadillacs</ENAMEX> where they had the little door underneath the hood You just open the door and pop it out yeah but but uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		is that right
 	
 	
 		i i had i had taken this in to have it done originally and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		what did they want to charge you for it
 	
 	
 		oh it it was it was tremendous well it was about <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">seven hours</TIMEX> labor so it it was going to run <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about four hundred dollars</NUMEX> or so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and they looked it over and they they
 		they thought they could patch it up a little bit you know and what not so they
 	
 	
 		this is your little water uh heater in there for the uh the heat inside
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah yeah and it was it was leaking inside the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> in the condenser <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> so uh they they did a little patch on it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and it last it held for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about four to six months</TIMEX> and i finally went back in and started looking at it myself and it it's a matter tearing all the dash out and all that kind of stuff but hey it was not
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh it was not a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">seven hour</NUMEX> labor job for me it was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about a week</TIMEX> before i finally through
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		did you get it inside or outside i i took one off my little <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buick</ENAMEX> i had and i pretty much took it loose on the inside but it came out from the you know underneath the hood it came from yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah oh really no this this was the only thing that sticks in inside the engine compartment on this are the two uh hose fittings
 	
 	
 		maybe you're right maybe you're right i it's been a long time since i took <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> out
 	
 	
 		yeah it it's i i've never heard a good story about uh
 	
 	
 		course
 		i broke mine you know so i'm always very careful when i change hoses on it i don't know whether you did yours
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		not to really pull on those i when i take those hoses i cut them off
 	
 	
 		right
 		okay
 	
 	
 		very gingerly because if you you know pull on that and i've always done that as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX> you know just yanked on it and they must have been stronger and heavier <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">copper</ENAMEX> at the time
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		sure
 	
 	
 		but i broke <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> on my on my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buick</ENAMEX> and i always remembered it was my own fault and i thought well i'm going to to going to carefully take those hoses off
 	
 	
 		you bet well that that's what ended up being the real problem on this was the uh it the the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pipe</ENAMEX> wasn't busted
 		but the it wasn't soldered in good enough and it had it had broken loose enough to where
 	
 	
 		oh really yeah
 	
 	
 		if it got hot
 	
 	
 		It it spread out yeah
 	
 	
 		and and not just normal driving didn't do it but if if if it was an especially hot day the pressure would get high enough and it would start blowing the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> out inside
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it was real aggravating but uh i i couldn't
 		even even <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a week</TIMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a week</TIMEX>'s time is is worth a whole lot less than <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">four than four hundred dollars</NUMEX> to me you know than to have somebody else do it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		sometimes if you're a tinkerer you luck out My <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>'s
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">uh Chevy</ENAMEX> uh it was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Caprice</ENAMEX> air conditioning stopped i i just heard it i realized that the air conditioning wasn't cutting in
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i went out there for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five minutes</TIMEX> and i just pushed on the wires And sure enough just pure dumb luck that the connection over by it's not the evaporator the big filter on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> side
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i just pushed that in and i heard it click
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and so sometimes you have dumb luck i i was you know you could have taken something like that and thought well the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">compressor</ENAMEX>'s not working or it would have taken me <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all day</TIMEX> probably if i didn't do that but sometimes you have some dumb luck If you have a little curiosity
 	
 	
 		right
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		and you have enough knowledge to check things out i know i feel bad for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who just when anything goes wrong a fuse you know they just have to take it And i know that's tough if you don't uh at least give it a shot i've got <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls daughters</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i've always said i'd teach them And my my <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> was fairly interested And i really haven't gotten around to i learned because i i just uh learned you know and i feel bad about not at least showing them some of the things And i'm going to do that i i told my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughters</ENAMEX> in college this year
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">This summer</TIMEX> we're definitely going to spend a little more time on the car i said
 		so you can learn the basics you know
 	
 	
 		well yeah and and and not only from a from an economic standpoint just just pure safety you know if you can if she can get yourself out of a bad situation
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		without having to to go to a phone <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">booth</ENAMEX> and stand around and wait it it it can it can save a lot of time and trouble
 	
 	
 		right
 		i have the there's one expression i don't like uh
 		the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> expression you know if it ain't if it ain't broke don't fix it
