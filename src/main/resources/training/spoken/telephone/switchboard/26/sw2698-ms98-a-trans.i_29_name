 		oh yeah well that's all right too
 	
 	
 		yeah i you know
 		yeah so i so i liked the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Forty</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Niners</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX>
 		
 
 		but uh i like watching the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colts</ENAMEX> play because i'm from originally from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indiana</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		oh oh wait a minute wait a minute wait <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a minute</TIMEX> if  the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Colts the Colts the Colts</ENAMEX> i still have trouble adjusting to that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indiana</ENAMEX> Colts
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		the Colts
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yes i guess i guess that sort of dates me but uh uh i i still think of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colts</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baltimore</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i know a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> do but uh

 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah for sure
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>

 		well they did the wrong thing by uh releasing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Landry</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few years ago</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		i yeah i thought they were going to lynch those people
 	
 	
 		i know
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		i i liked  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Landry</ENAMEX> you know i have no respect for the for the new coaching <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> since they ousted him
 	
 	
 		well you know how do you get rid of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX> like that <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">and and and</ENAMEX> and justify it i mean
 	
 	
 		oh not i know not at all
 	
 	
 		that really was kind of sad i got sort of a raw deal on that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		really
 		
 
 	
 	
 		So uh
 	
 	
 		you you you said something you know
 		uh in in college <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> you <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> have some some have you got  anything promising <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> as far as college <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> like like uh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> A and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well
 	
 	
 		or you keech up keep up with collegiate
 	
 	
 		well i have to admit i don't keep up with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> i keep up with uh i'm from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Purdue</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh yeah oh absolutely
 	
 	
 		and
 		and so i keep up with what's going on up there they're going to have a new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coach</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ohio State</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh they it looks looks to be promising for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Purdue</ENAMEX> within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next few years</TIMEX> so we're looking forward to seeing their program turn around
 	
 	
 		uh
 		yeah well <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Purdue</ENAMEX>'s been kind of out of it for a long time
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i i i didn't know <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Purdue i</ENAMEX> didn't even know <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Purdue</ENAMEX> still had a football
 	
 	
 		oh yeah  you don't hear about them much in fact you don't even hear about their <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">basketball</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> much any more but you know
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		that's how it how it goes i guess
 	
 	
 		yeah well it will be interesting to see well especially you know um uh here here in the in the bay area you know this this used to be the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> also of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">of the of</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Raiders</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> here still feel that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Raiders</ENAMEX> are are are are you know in are in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oakland</ENAMEX> but uh
 		i it's it's going to be real interesting to see what happens because uh there there're a lot of changes are happening here in the bay area as far as that they're talking about maybe getting a new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stadium</ENAMEX> and with those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> leaving i mean
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Feagin</ENAMEX> and and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronnie Lotte</ENAMEX> i i i can't imagine a more devastating blow to a team you know the the uh the the top running back and the top defensive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">player</ENAMEX> uh leaving is
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		gee going to be interesting to see what happens

 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">uh Bo</ENAMEX> well i don't know what they're going to do about <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Bo Bo</ENAMEX> is is
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		is pretty much out of it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah i think <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bo</ENAMEX> is you're talking about speaking about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bo Jackson</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		well uh
 		uh uh uh it just doesn't sound like that with what's wrong with him that you know we're going to find out what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bo</ENAMEX>'s made out of
 	
 	
 		oh yeah some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> think they're predicting that he'll make a big comeback
 	
 	
 		well uh i'm sure he wants to but i would be i'd frankly
 		extremely surprised
 	
 	
 		yeah i would be too
 	
 	
 		i really would that kind of you know that that kind of injury is not not something that
 		well i i hope he does you know more power to him i think that'd be just absolutely wonderful so do you i i guess uh uh i i've talked with a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX> from from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> it
