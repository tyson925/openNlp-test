 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so well this is an appropriate topic <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Earth Day</ENAMEX> i thought
 	
 	
 		right
 		um
 	
 	
 		um  well what do you think is uh the pollutants the main pollutants in the air
 	
 	
 		i have trouble with the chemical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> and things like that i just uh i think they put off so much and they're not regulated enough
 	
 	
 		yeah that's me too after um on channel thirteen uh they had some
 		some programs <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day before</TIMEX> and i'm not sure that about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> we didn't really watch it too much <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> but <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> before they had a lot of programs about the environment and
 		you know how we're affecting the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX> and things by what we do as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and and they mentioned <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon dioxide</ENAMEX> a lot and that actually um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		as our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> increases and you know our of course our our <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> you know our number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> increase per the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> that's the problem but also like you said
 		the industry pollution and you know they're regulation they're regulation that's placed on them is
 		i mean it's better than it used to be but it's incredible that they still don't have you know they don't they're not made to regulate the amount of pollutants that they put into the air
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know i i just i can't stand that and i know for a fact
 		that they get away with a lot that you know they're supposed to be regulated because we have a we have a plant i don't know about <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> but we have a plant uh a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pillsbury</ENAMEX> plant
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		in in a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> adjacent to ours and i know <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that work there that of course you wouldn't think <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pillsbury</ENAMEX> would put out certain chemicals
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		but they put out toxic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemicals</ENAMEX> there just in some of the um
 		what they do uh to uh make their dough and stuff to
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clean</ENAMEX> out the flour and stuff like that yeah i mean it's incredible and um
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		they said that they're you know they have a little creek that runs by them and some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that work there have told me that when they have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inspectors</ENAMEX> coming
 		they you know shut down everything and they clean up their act but on a normal basis that they're that they're dumping things
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		that they're not supposed to be dumping and i'm like if they're getting away with it
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		can you imagine that's a that's a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pillsbury</ENAMEX> plant i can't imagine plants
 	
 	
 		i wouldn't have thought that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pillsbury</ENAMEX> could would the i mean or even had <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemicals</ENAMEX> you know well
 	
 	
 		yeah they have <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemicals</ENAMEX> that they use to refine their flours with and stuff you know to to break the flours down and then they they also do testing there and i don't you know when when you consider you know it's probably not radioactive but toxic can be
 	
 	
 		those <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemicals</ENAMEX> would not
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		can be anything that's  uh classified that can damage the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		right yeah
 	
 	
 		so there could be a lot of things that they could put you know that chemicalwise that they use to uh that they are testing with
 	
 	
 		right you know like in
 	
 	
 		that they're dumping
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		in packaging and uh you know just goodness
 	
 	
 		yeah i don't think they do the packaging at this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> but they do they do a lot of research and they do um they do do a lot of the refining up there or i'm not really what's it called when you do flour i'm not
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		uh
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only</NUMEX> thing i can think is bleaching but i mean i i don't know what's how they do the flour
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah but
 	
 	
 		but um we we're on the southwest side of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Houston</ENAMEX> we don't have that much as far as uh any of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> over on this uh the west east <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">side</ENAMEX> does
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		we've got <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Imperial</ENAMEX> sugar but uh
 		and they're you know they're right there on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">creek</ENAMEX> also and uh they've been there for years
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		but i mean you think about it it you know it's probably a lot easier to detect things that go into the ground than it is
 		maybe to just i'm not really sure but i would think it would be easier to detect those things because you could detect them down strean or stream or such or you can you can you know do uh testing on the ground itself at that point
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but when they pollute into the air and you've got you know and you've got movement through the air it's going to move a lot of that off so i don't see
 		you know how they can do some of the tests unless it just hangs there like in places where it's a lot of pollution you know like in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> or or the bigger <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> where it it tends to get stuck there you know that you have a lot more particles in the air
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		right yeah
 	
 	
 		you know per per uh per particles in the surrounding community because it's not moved away
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but um
 	
 	
 		i know that i worry every <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">now</TIMEX> and then we're still on a well water we're not on city water
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i think well what if somebody's dumped something back there in the and no one knows about it and you know it sinked in through the ground and all that
 	
 	
 		yeah well i know out in some i'm not sure
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i can't remember the name of the county it's it's where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stillwater</ENAMEX> is or
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		Sweet no i'm not sure i know it i think it's uh i know we have a piece property there it's called <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dublin</ENAMEX> it's in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dublin Texas</ENAMEX> i'm not really sure what the county it's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen no Stephenville</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh okay okay
 	
 	
 		okay where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stephenville's</ENAMEX> at they've had a lot of problems because they've um introduced a lot of dairies there
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so they have a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cattle</ENAMEX> in the area i mean they've got like per per yard uh per lot
 		you know they've got like a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of cattle
 		because dairies they don't the the it's not like it was a big ranch where they let the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cow</ENAMEX> roam around free they've got to have them there to be able to milk them and they and i read in this article i couldn't believe it where you know like one cow produces like
 	
 	
 		right uh-huh
 	
 	
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a day</TIMEX> produces <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">like a hundred or so</NUMEX> pounds of manure
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		one cow i was like my God and they and this thing says that that you know if <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> think well cow <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">manure</ENAMEX> is good for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fertilizer</ENAMEX> but when you get that much <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">manure</ENAMEX> it says it becomes a real problem because it's not it's not
 		when you know you buy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cow manure</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX> they've added stuff to it and they've added humus and stuff that breaks it down and and this
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and this article said that they've got a real problem that um you've got toxins and and uh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">manure</ENAMEX> that is what it's doing is it's going through uh they don't have a very deep um oh
 		you know they're water
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		they're natural water uh
 		i forget what that's called with you know it's like a spring spring <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> but it's below the surface it's not very far down
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and all this stuff is seeping through to the water and they're like they're afraid that you know within a certain amount of years
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		that it's they're water they're water in that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> will be totally polluted and they won't be able to have any drinking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> because they will have um polluted
 	
 	
 		it will
 	
 	
 		completely polluted so that they're you know there's too many toxins and bacterial growth and i'm like my God you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah and the ground
 		right
 	
 	
 		just from that one you know just from them introducing dairy <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">farms</ENAMEX> in that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">county</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah and the the ground will fil ter some of it but not all of it
 	
 	
 		no not when you figure i didn't realize a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cow one cow</ENAMEX> produces that much <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">manure</ENAMEX> and they were talking like
 	
 	
 		these are well fed
 	
 	
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cows</ENAMEX> you know they were talking <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cows</ENAMEX> in one little tiny area you
 	
 	
 		
 
 		these are
 		good grief these are well fed <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cows</ENAMEX> uh
 	
 	
 		well they are evidently but um i mean even evidently a normal cow produces that much too
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but they're just so spread out on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ranches</ENAMEX> and stuff that it's not you know a problem
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but when they get them in these tiny little areas you know and they've got a real big problem and they they said that that what they were doing was scraping it with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bulldozers</ENAMEX> and stuff and taking it to uh these
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		like ponds that they had to filter it with but the ponds because they've had so much <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rain</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past few years</TIMEX> they just overflow and they overflow into the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the creeks</TIMEX> and stuff in the area
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so that just creates you know there there's and oh it was just disgusting it said the creeks will foam <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people people</ENAMEX> stand outside their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> and their watch the creeks <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foam</ENAMEX> brown and all and i'm just like oh my gosh and the smell is really bad they say
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh now that's bad
 		right i was going to say the air pollution alone there just from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred</NUMEX> pounds of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cow manure</ENAMEX> was going to be bad
 	
 	
 		yeah but i i don't know it really frightens me though as far as the
 		when you think about the you know thinking of just air pollution itself and then and channel thirteen they're really um
 		emphasizing the problem with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid rain</ENAMEX> you know if we if we keep putting that stuff into the air and and you know if we keep creating the problem and not doing anything about it that it's really going to be a problem for um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		just the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">the Earth</ENAMEX> you know what the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX> is receiving back you know because how can you tell where it's going to come down at
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right right and then cutting the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> you know that bothers me
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		as far as you know
 	
 	
 		the rain forest and all
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yes uh
 		we've been wanting to well not me but uh it's been recommended or suggested that we cut a few of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> down here i'm like no you know you know for what's cut down here you know more will be cut down someplace else and
 		it will just take that longer to grow back and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> help so that uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i don't
 	
 	
 		well they do because what is it carbon dioxide they use that where we can't synthesize it and they're synthesizing it for us
 	
 	
 		uh-huh they
 		right right believe me it's just so much better
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so uh yeah i knew i think there's lots that be that could be done to to improve how things are done now
 	
 	
 		yeah i think we just have to i don't know personally you know i suppose you know if you just make sure your <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> is
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		is working properly and you you know they're suppose nowadays they have the emission controls on them but
 		uh i think the only the main thing is just keep on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">legislators</ENAMEX>' your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">legislators</ENAMEX>' back
 		you know as far as
 		seems like they've only just really started as far as the environment saying okay we're really going to get involved it it's really becoming a problem by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year two thousand</TIMEX> there will what what are we going to have what kind of results are we going to have for the environment and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		right
 	
 	
 		and what will we
