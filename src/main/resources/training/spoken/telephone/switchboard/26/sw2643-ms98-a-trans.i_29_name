 
     		
 	
 		how did you all get tied up with this uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> system
 	
 	
 		oh did you already dial one
 	
 	
 		yeah i just dial one
 	
 	
 		we're being recorded already
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		okay uh we're supposed to be discussing our homes
 	
 	
 		yeah but what what uh what did you uh are you with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TIer</ENAMEX> or how did you get tied up with this
 	
 	
 		oh it's a uh long story but uh let's discuss about our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> um  what kind of home do you live in
 	
 	
 		uh i guess a typical home here is without a uh uh basement i guess that's the classical uh
 	
 	
 		raised style
 	
 	
 		yeah uh we have something here we have something here you may not have up there which is a well we we were phasing them out is the wood shingle roof i don't know if you had it when i <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> got here
 	
 	
 		uh-huh my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> live huh
 		where did you got get there from
 	
 	
 		from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Jersey</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		all right
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		i new you didn't have a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> accent
 	
 	
 		right no i i'm my accent's gone i've practiced <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a long time</TIMEX> to get rid of it uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		the the wood shingle roofs are phasing out here they're very they're good for air-conditioning you know they they
 	
 	
 		i hear you
 	
 	
 		it's you it's very shocking when you look inside the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">attic</ENAMEX> and on a dry day
 		and see <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred</NUMEX> little or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of little light wholes you know
 	
 	
 		i would imagine so
 	
 	
 		it it's very strange and then when of course when it rains then it then it then it stretches
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and does a pretty good job but uh the the fire hazard has is
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		uh-huh i would imagine
 	
 	
 		phasing that kind of construction out it it's so
 	
 	
 		so what kind of home do you live in
 	
 	
 		oh it's a rent it's a multistorey
 		uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> uh luckily
 	
 	
 		oh a colonial style <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> story
 	
 	
 		no colonial is not the word had they use here uh that's
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">multistorey</ENAMEX> is what they call them
 	
 	
 		a multilevel it's called multilevel
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		it it it's not it's not really that typical it's a custom home
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh i live in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arlington</ENAMEX> actually this i'm working <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">tonight</TIMEX> actually in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		at <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> here
 	
 	
 		oh you work at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TI</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		so that's how you got hooked up to this
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		you know you know you can converse with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> for a while and get to know them before you punch the one you don't have to get started on the conversation right away
 	
 	
 		oh yeah your right your right
 	
 	
 		well anyway um well uh
 	
 	
 		how many calls have you made uh have you
 	
 	
 		oh i don't know <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several eleven twelve</NUMEX> thirteen i guess
 	
 	
 		oh really everyone everyone's higher than i am
 	
 	
 		well i haven't made the calls mostly i've just uh i answered them i live in a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> story type colonial here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maryland</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah that that i heard i know those words from the east when i was there but that they don't use that word here
 	
 	
 		yeah well most the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> here are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> story because uh they stack them up since the property is so expensive at least in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maryland</ENAMEX> area where i am
 	
 	
 		do you have a basement
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		oh yeah that's typical up there to you know
 	
 	
 		yeah well like i say the land here and depending on where you are and how crowded it is the land bays go up and here a little old <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">measly quarter</TIMEX> of an acre goes from anywhere from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four to five thousand</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred</NUMEX> and some odd thousand depending on where it is
 	
 	
 		oh yeah no the land is much cheaper here
 	
 	
 		and if you're in a fairly decent subdivision which i guess maybe i'm in a fairly middle-class <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subdivision</ENAMEX> then
 		the general trend is to put as much <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> as you can on <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a quarter acre</NUMEX> it took me a long time to get used to it coming from down south up here
 		big big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> on little bitty postage stamp lots
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh that's the general way they uh
 		they build them here so you get <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about a twenty two hundred</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three thousand</NUMEX> square foot home depending on whether you include the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">basement</ENAMEX> or not
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh on <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about a quarter of an acre or less about ten thousand square feet</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lots</ENAMEX> aren't very big here either in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> uh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fort Worth</ENAMEX> area
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh but the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">basement</ENAMEX> there just aren't any <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">basements</ENAMEX> i don't know of anyone ever even thought of putting a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">basement</ENAMEX> in here
 	
 	
 		huh
 		well they use slab <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">foundations</ENAMEX> or do they use block <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">foundations</ENAMEX> or the little
 	
 	
 		uh it used to be a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pier</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">beam</ENAMEX> where they would drill <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">piers</ENAMEX> and and the first you would have a crawl space underneath your <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> but that's phased out in the last <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty five years</TIMEX> where it's all slab
 	
 	
 		crawl space
 		okay slabs are easier and quicker to pour and lay i guess
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and uh they they say that the the reason they don't put pier i think it's cheaper like you say but uh the soil does move a lot here and they say that you just couldn't uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		put a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">basement</ENAMEX> in the soil but i'd think they just to me i don't know really know why it wouldn't work i think you can put a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">basement</ENAMEX> in anywhere it's just not not popular
 	
 	
 		i see what to dig out for it
 	
 	
 		yeah really
 	
 	
 		do you have high water tables
 	
 	
 		no no it's not very high some of the water here
 	
 	
 		so it's just a matter they just don't do it
 	
 	
 		yeah this is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> there the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>'s down <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">two thousand feet</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		well of course down there you probably don't have land as quite as much a premium so you can sprawl a big rancher out
 	
 	
 		yeah i guess it's the style i really don't have an answer here because of the tornado i always thought tornados uh i thought <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> would build a lot of storm cellars you know or shelters you know but even that is not uh popular at all i don't know i don't know of anyone doing that uh
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh i don't even see it in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX> where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> advertise that they have storm cellars or anything they just don't have them period
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		i understand well uh you say you live in a ranch style house yourself
 	
 	
 		yeah it's it's multilevel yeah like my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garage</ENAMEX> i have uh uh a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedroom</ENAMEX> over
 	
 	
 		well now
 		is it like a split level
 	
 	
 		split level yeah
 	
 	
 		in other words you've got some <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedrooms</ENAMEX> above say a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garage area</ENAMEX> and then the living room dining <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> area is halfway between both you go down steps to your <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garage</ENAMEX> and maybe a family <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> down there and you go up the steps to your bedroom
 	
 	
 		right
 		right exactly
 		right
 		right right
 	
 	
 		okay that's what they call a split level up here and a split <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">foyer</ENAMEX> is where all the steps are at the entrance way
 		if you know what i mean
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		that's a split <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">foyer</ENAMEX> type and then uh a colonial is where they stack it on top of each other and you pretty well have most of your living space on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> floor like uh
 		a family <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> or uh you know something like that and the dining <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> area and a living room and maybe a a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen</ENAMEX> with a possible little eat in area or somethi ng like that
 	
 	
 		what's your typical heating up there in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maryland</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">gas</ENAMEX> or
 	
 	
 		well uh you  i've been through <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two or three</NUMEX> different things of them first house i came up here had gas heat with electric stove then the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> i owned had gas heat and gas stove and uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um even gas water heater whereas my previous home it had electric water heater anyway and then the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> i'm in now is all
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh electric it even has a heat pump
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yeah and uh
 	
 	
 		well heat pumps nice up there it would probably work pretty well
 	
 	
 		well heat pumps do work pretty well up here it's taking them <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few years</TIMEX> to get the bugs out of them but uh
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true
 	
 	
 		they they finally seem to work quite well and i would imagine down where you all live heat pumps will work quite well or maybe down there all you need is just air-conditioning that's all
 	
 	
 		well they should yeah because it's warmer in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the winter</TIMEX> or you have less of a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> down here of course it's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a short winter</TIMEX> but it does get down to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">five degrees</NUMEX> uh occasionally
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but uh i don't really know if heat pumps are that popular yet i guess uh i don't i haven't been that close to it in the newer homes
 	
 	
 		well i would imagine all you need is just air-conditioning
 	
 	
 		yeah we we have heat uh some have air-conditioning <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> i i i have an all electric <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX> but uh it's fifty fifty there's a lot of gas <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> here uh because it's so popular
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh that's right you're you're in the oil <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> so i would imagine there's plenty of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> around so that's the way to go for heat
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> i think probably prefer natural gas for for heating
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh i would too because me i like gas heat i love it
 	
 	
 		i don't i'm an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineer</ENAMEX> and i don't like the danger of it i've seen too many <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> here blowup and i think yeah and i just think
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		when i had i had uh a gas uh
 		uh fireplace you know i had and i saw the way it was constructed yeah it went over my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedrooms</ENAMEX> you know over the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garage</ENAMEX> i thought and there's there's just too many fittings in this thing to leak and so i just disconnected i never did hook that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sucker</ENAMEX> up so i just took it out completely
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> logs
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		although <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> love gas here but i i'm ultraconservative on safety and i just don't don't want it
 	
 	
 		uh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		well i don't mind electric heating and and the like it's okay i mean i i like gas heat because it's so nice and warm but when it comes to cooking i cook i just absolute think a gas stove's the best that money can buy
 	
 	
 		yeah well i've heard people
 	
 	
 		you just can't beat cooking on gas
 	
 	
 		yeah i've heard <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> say that i and i
 	
 	
 		that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">flame man</ENAMEX> is hard to beat because you can regulate it and i mean you you want to turn the flame down on the stove you turn it down right now you don't have to wait for a cool down time which you have to rely on with uh conventional stove or or a warm-up time i mean it's instantly there
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		right
 	
 	
 		and that kind of response is quite uh quite effective i think for cooking
 	
 	
 		oh yeah no i i've i've known <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> love it for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> and uh but uh we've done without it for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty years</TIMEX> here and and uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 		well i've done without it too but i sure prefer it my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> does too
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah no i i haven't i haven't really noticed uh i don't miss it you know with our of course i'm against i'm just i'm one of the
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that uh is against uh gas
 	
 	
 		well do your <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> down there have <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">porches</ENAMEX> or are they just pretty much like just a front door and that's it
 	
 	
 		no
 		no there's not much in front there's no sitting out front you know there's no like like in the east when i was young
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		of course it goes way back we used to sit out front i had a porch up front but no there's not a porch
 	
 	
 		yeah aren't they nice
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah oh yeah
 	
 	
 		they're sort of coming back up here in the east
 	
 	
 		i i i wish i had that you know
 	
 	
 		front <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">porches</ENAMEX> are they're not very big but they're kind of coming back
 	
 	
 		right i i think the old ways in a lot of uh ways should come back uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh uh</ENAMEX>-huh but i really love a screened in porch outback <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> i just eat that up
 	
 	
 		but no the
 		yeah no that there it's not popular here either screens in screen in is not that that's so that's uh
 	
 	
 		huh
 		well don't you all have mosquitoes down there
 	
 	
 		not like not like you have up there no
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		it's too dry it's so dry that it's uh
 	
 	
 		that's surprising
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> is super dry
 	
 	
 		hm
 		how far are you <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> from the coast down there where uh

 		and a little bit of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX> an then it goes into super dry <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all summer</TIMEX> then you <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> with a hurricane <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX> but
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		well tell me uh do your <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> down there pretty much have garage disposals and things like that
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah they have everything
 	
 	
 		they do are y'all on septic or y'all have public sewage
 	
 	
 		no <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> there's essentially no septic not in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas Fort Worth</ENAMEX> though you have it in the out lying areas but uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh they use <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one and two</NUMEX> car <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garages</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">just one</NUMEX> car <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garages</ENAMEX> or carports
 	
 	
 		<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two two</TIMEX>
 		no not carports uh it's essentially garages
 	
 	
 		okay so they do go <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garage</ENAMEX> because i lived down south for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a long time</TIMEX> carports were real popular in certain areas where i
 	
 	
 		yeah not <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> uh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fort Worth</ENAMEX> is you know the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> car <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garage</ENAMEX> and certainly all air-conditioned uh
 	
 	
 		used to live
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh uh <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">two thousand square feet</NUMEX> is probably i don't know if that's average or not
 	
 	
 		about how much floor space
 		yeah that sounds about average i think all over the country
 	
 	
 		yeah uh i i think so too there's a lot of swimming <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pools</ENAMEX> here i don't have one uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh really i don't either i hate to clean the rascals i had a i had a pool outback behind my previous house <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of those
