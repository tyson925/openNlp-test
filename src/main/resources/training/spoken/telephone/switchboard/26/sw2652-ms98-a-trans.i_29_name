 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay
 		guess we can go ahead um well i guess you know it's you know since living in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> it's always so hot so in the summertime i just i wear lots of shorts so because i don't work during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the day</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so do you work
 	
 	
 		yes uh-huh yeah i do work um
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and but i work at a manufacturing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> so i wear a lot of blue jeans and T-shirts
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but occasionally i have to get dressed up and wear panty hose and a dress and high heel shoes and i feel really uncomfortable doing that and in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> so uh it's it's a problem for me
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but normally i just wear blue jeans and a T-shirt very very comfortable i like that so much better than having to wear dress clothes
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah yeah and buying suits and stuff yeah because just being at home and i work at home so
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i just have you know i just wear my you know my shorts and stuff like that i don't go out and spend lots of money on uh different you know suits and stuff you know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but when i before i got married you know i was working so i uh
 		
 
 		you know i had more suits and stuff then but
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		worry about all that kind of stuff
 	
 	
 		well i have plenty of suits and dress clothes because i'm like you when i <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> started working um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i have all these suits and blouses and skirts and mix and match and that kind of stuff
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but now that i you know work in the manufacturing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> then it's just it's so much more difficult for me to to actually get dressed up to come in to work like that
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		um but occasionally i have to because uh part of my job is teaching and training and uh so you have to look just a little bit nicer than your normal grab
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		when you're training right yeah
 	
 	
 		than your normal garb but i'm like you too uh i moved from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX> down to here
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh</ENAMEX> moved somewhere i mean
 	
 	
 		and i had mostly polyesters and wools and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> clothes and buying all these <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">cotton</ENAMEX> clothes and then of course you have to iron them all the time that's really that's been a problem for me
 	
 	
 		winter
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah because i came from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wyoming</ENAMEX> and i had wool suits and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wool skirts</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know i've got all these clothes that i never wear because you can't wear them here and um
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 	
 	
 		the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seasons</TIMEX> are just so much different you have so much summer
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh so then when i you know i finally get a chance to go out with my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> it's like a real chore to find something nice to wear
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that's true that's true
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		well i know i was just now um uh putting away a lot of my <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> clothes
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i was going through here and i was thinking i haven't worn this in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three years</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and because it's a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wool skirt</ENAMEX> and there's just not that many opportunities to wear it and i have <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">five or six</NUMEX> wool skirts
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so i was thinking well maybe you know i need to think about getting rid of them but
 		no i folded it up neatly and put it away  maybe next year
 	
 	
 		yeah you hate to get rid of it because you know how much you spent on them
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and it's real hard to get rid of some of that stuff i know
 	
 	
 		i know i agree with you
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		well i know <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> uh well <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this past winter</TIMEX> it wasn't that cold
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the previous winter</TIMEX> we had more uh cold weather where i was able to actually wear your double and triple layerings of uh clothes yeah like you would when you're up north so
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		clothes yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		that's really interesting
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah and i i just don't spend you know right now my clothes come from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Target</ENAMEX> you know
 	
 	
 		yes yes yes and they're all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one hundred</NUMEX> percent cotton and
 	
 	
 		yes and they you take them out of the drier and they're wadded up in a ball
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yes yes i know so i uh i have my ironing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> sitting out all the time i never put mine away
 	
 	
 		oh i'm so glad to meet somebody that that their iron <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> is their permanent fixture in their house
 	
 	
 		
 
 		it is it is
 	
 	
 		you know i have very little furniture but  my ironing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> is part of my decor so
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that's true and and i've been looking at these um uh like in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Home Depot</ENAMEX> where you can go and they've got that ironing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boards</ENAMEX> that will just flip right down off of the um uh
 		what the the the door and uh and then you can have actually have one where you can put it inside of a wall you know to have it permanently attached and that's what i'm thinking i'm going to have to do because <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mine</ENAMEX>'s sitting right out in front of my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedroom</ENAMEX> and it's just
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it's just an eyesore i think with all the
 	
 	
 		well yeah it is it is but it's like uh i just don't want to do it
 	
 	
 		hum-um hum-um  no i've been thinking about putting the ironing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> in the closet
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and and running you know a line in there for my iron so i could do it in there and i wouldn't have to have that eyesore
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		that's an idea oh yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah so i have a big closet
 	
 	
 		yeah i you know if i have if i know i'm having somebody come over to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and there's a possibility they might be going back into my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> i will put it away but
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah
 	
 	
 		i iron our clothes as we go along so you know
 	
 	
 		um-hum i no longer do that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekly</TIMEX> thing because i have so many and i'm like you i <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the night</TIMEX> before or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that day</TIMEX> i will iron whatever it is that we need and that's it because it's too many <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundred</NUMEX> percent cotton
 	
 	
 		right no
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 		uh-huh you can't iron it all and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah and then with my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> they're always getting into you know they can't decide what they want to wear so they change their minds you know i know i mean my oldest is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only four</NUMEX> but she's
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 	
 	
 		changes her mind <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two or three</NUMEX> times before she figures out what she's going to wear so
 	
 	
 		right right oh i know i know
 	
 	
 		and then they never put anything back
 	
 	
 		no no of course not no that uh that would be too simple
 	
 	
 		so
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah that that that's called smart you know they don't we don't do that kind of stuff you know
 	
 	
 		absolutely not
 	
 	
 		that's called too easy on mom
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		our lot in life is to make her life miserable so
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh absolutely absolutely
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		yeah  well that's it's been good talking to you to see somebody hear somebody that does the same thing i do because i tell people what i do and they just go oh how do you do that it's like it's easy you just do it you know
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		that's right that's right you do you do so uh but yeah i uh i know several of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">girlfriends</ENAMEX> though we uh we all keep our ironing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boards</ENAMEX> out and just uh an ever present thing in our household so
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah yeah i don't think i'd know what to do if it wasn't there you know my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> wouldn't know where to hang his dirty clothes
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know
 	
 	
 		there you go things that need to be mended things that have to get ironed um-hum um-hum um-hum that's true
 	
 	
 		yeah he wouldn't know where to put things so
 		yeah so
 	
 	
 		oh well it was nice talking with you
 	
 	
 		oh it was nice talking with you too
 	
 	
 		okay take care uh-huh bye-bye
 	
 	
 		take care bye-bye
