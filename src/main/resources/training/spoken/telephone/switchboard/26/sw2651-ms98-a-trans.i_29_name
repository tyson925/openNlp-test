 		okay
 	
 	
 		uh but all traditional they're they're uh they're some are contemporary contemporary but mostly traditional
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah oh
 	
 	
 		how about your home
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		are you interested in uh
 	
 	
 		it's uh it's a salt <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">box</ENAMEX> that's a it's a it's a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New England</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh gosh
 	
 	
 		type
 		uh i was born and brought up in the area that that i lived in and it was very rural and there was nothing there but uh
 		
 
 		uh farms
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> or orchards one or the other you know there was a lot of apple orchards so when we decided to build we built
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about thirteen years ago</TIMEX> uh we looked for a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> and the things that we were seeing were
 		uh not up to my standards they were still building <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> back then like they have for
 		a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundred and fifty</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> you know the very little insulation in the walls and very little insulation in the ceiling so
 	
 	
 		yes um-hum
 		that doesn't work these days
 	
 	
 		yeah and it was uh
 		it wasn't what we wanted so we did some research and i knew the land there's a lot of ledge up here so you have to be careful
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh their septic systems when there's no uh uh public <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sewer system</ENAMEX>
 		there is water however so we picked out a piece of land that we liked and bought it and then we decided to build so we we did a lot of research like i said and we
 		and we built a typical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New England</ENAMEX> salt <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">box</ENAMEX> in the area and when we built we were the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> there there was like about
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> acres of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">oak</ENAMEX> forest around us
 	
 	
 		oh my
 	
 	
 		and it was absolutely gorgeous uh since then however they've torn it all down and we're surrounded by homes you know that's a that's another long story
 	
 	
 		yes
 		yes
 	
 	
 		but we're the only typical <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New England</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">home</ENAMEX> in the area there's a lot of there's an <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> Tudor right next to us and there's uh there's a colonial our street's on just a short <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> there's only like <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> on it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and there's a uh an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> colonial down on the corner and the rest are raised <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ranches</ENAMEX> and you know the typical uh home
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		but we built ours um  we made uh we did it ourselves uh i sent uh uh
 		some rough plans out to an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX> to have him draw it up and then i subbed out the things that i couldn't do like i had a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crew</ENAMEX> come in and frame it and i did the rest i did the inside the wiring the plumbing and uh you know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		sure
 		my goodness
 	
 	
 		so we built the walls huh
 	
 	
 		you are multitalented
 		you are multitalented
 	
 	
 		uh my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> had built a couple when we were growing up so kind of got used to it and we did a lot of research
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		sure
 		sure well if you were to do it uh again <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> what would you have done differently
 		name things say
 	
 	
 		uh
 		
 
 		we made the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen</ENAMEX> a working <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen</ENAMEX> i think i would've made the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen</ENAMEX> uh a lot bigger because both of us like to cook
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and right now a working <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen</ENAMEX> is very efficient but
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> kind of get in each other's way yeah it's similar to a galley <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen yeah</ENAMEX> and then we have uh a like a little dining <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">area</ENAMEX> off that we have a formal dining room
 	
 	
 		is that like a galley kitchen
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um i've since added onto the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> we've got like uh uh looks like an old rustic uh log cabin on the inside
 		uh it's all natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wood</ENAMEX> the ceiling's pine the walls are pine you know it's uh one of those type kick around rooms
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and we put a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">greenhouse</ENAMEX> on it it was uh designed to be heated by the sun
 	
 	
 		yes how does that work in the winter
 	
 	
 		um it works fine as long as you don't put any <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> in it
 	
 	
 		exactly it burns it up i'm a plant uh former <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> and uh business uh-huh so uh you know
 	
 	
 		yes
 		oh are you
 		oh
 		we raise orchids
 	
 	
 		oh my
 	
 	
 		which is a little bit tough to do up here in the north but it's a solar greenhouse we put up you know like the walls are <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">six inches</NUMEX> thick
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah well do you not have shade cloths and so forth and
 		uh-huh well
 	
 	
 		no no we used uh fiberglass we're faced the the greenhouse faces solar south
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		and it's it's double glazed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiberglass</ENAMEX> with a one inch airspace in between it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so it's kind of opaque we don't use shading on it um  but we do have to uh have air a lot of air movement even in the wintertime it can get uh brutally hot in there
 		so the way it was designed was to uh
 		uh i put a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> foot <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">foundation</ENAMEX> under it and put in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty two</TIMEX> ton of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rock</ENAMEX> with with uh hot air piped through it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all day</TIMEX> long it just heats up and then at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> it just gives it back into the house
 	
 	
 		well great great
 	
 	
 		so it's it's not bad it's it's uh
 		i'd like a little bit warm land i'd like to go up further north and i'd like to instead of having a salt box i'd like to have it all on on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> floor
 	
 	
 		yes
 		well come south and uh you will already you will be watching the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">azaleas bloom</ENAMEX> and go they are just about gone this time of the year
 	
 	
 		that's right  you <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> must yeah because the actually the winter hasn't been really bad
 	
 	
 		we're all
 		no huh-uh everything's green all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">leaves</ENAMEX> are out and all that
 		so it's pret ty
 	
 	
 		so you got your garden planted
 	
 	
 		my spinach
 	
 	
 		yeah sir
 		it's it's probably gotten just a little bit too warm now we have trouble up here with uh uh
 	
 	
 		really
 		well for not <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crops summer crops</ENAMEX> it's uh it's really not time to plant okra not quite the ground isn't warm enough but uh
 		some of those
 	
 	
 		yeah no i uh i put down black plastic
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		to help heat it up you know put it on the radishes and spinach but spinach kind of bolts quick on us so we put it <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Swiss</ENAMEX> chard instead yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah right get that out early um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		so anyhow that's what we've done for our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> we've left it all natural so there's no upkeep you know it's white cedar shingle
 	
 	
 		sure yeah
 	
 	
 		and the trim is stained so i don't have to go out and scrape and paint
 		because i figured when i got old and retire i don't want to be working i don't be a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">slave</ENAMEX> to the home
 	
 	
 		no no you don't want to be on ladders do you
 		you don't want to be on a ladder
 	
 	
 		um right right because that peek is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">twenty eight feet</NUMEX> high and you come off <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twenty eight</NUMEX> feet and it hurts so
