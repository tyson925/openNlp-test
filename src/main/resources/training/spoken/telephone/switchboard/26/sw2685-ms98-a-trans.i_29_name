 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		here we go i guess we're on the air huh yeah well i tell you what this been pretty nice <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> hasn't it
 	
 	
 		yep
 		uh yeah we've been uh real lucky here it was one of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">those days</TIMEX> where you wish you uh you didn't want to have to go back into work
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah i'm well i'm on i'm taking <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">some vacation this week</TIMEX> so it didn't bother me uh i'm a distance runner by hobby and uh i might say it was a little humid running out there tonight i was probably wetter than i have been in some time
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		huh
 	
 	
 		but uh for for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> that likes to be outside as much as i do and run like i do this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> is almost ideal
 		because uh i would say probably i run <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three hundred days</TIMEX> out of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three hundred and sixty five</NUMEX> and there's probably not more than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty of those days</TIMEX> that i can't wear shorts and tee shirt
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i mean i have to wear long sleeves and maybe some long pants and that's fine with me if i can wear shorts and tee shirt i'm perfectly happy
 	
 	
 		yeah i would
 		i remember how the weather was when i was down there i got a sunburn in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February</TIMEX> working on my uh my roof in a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> in Plano
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so i uh i remember how it was yeah it's it's really great um here on the east coast we've you know we usually have the traditional <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX> showers but it has just been so unusually wet here
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		we've had all the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rain</ENAMEX> that they should've had out in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well what what what we like to do is get enough <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rain</ENAMEX> so not to have to water the lawn
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and it's been i've watered once in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX> and not any time in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX> because i figure we figure if we go <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five days</TIMEX> without <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rain</ENAMEX> we need to water and just about every <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fifth day</TIMEX> we're getting rain right now
 	
 	
 		well that's great
 	
 	
 		so everything is pretty and green here and we're not really uh and not having to pay money to water
 		and uh of course of course <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summers summers</TIMEX> uh i i guess uh once you get climatized and i am i mean i kind of look forward to the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">hundred degrees</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> except except for the air conditioning bills i i could i could do without the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three hundred</NUMEX> dollar electric bills
 	
 	
 		yeah i remember those
 		yeah well we've moved into a new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> uh at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of February</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and of course it's a new development and there's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> in the whole <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">thirty houses</ENAMEX> that are here that has grass
 	
 	
 		oh for goodness sake oh i know what that means
 	
 	
 		so everything everything else is mud
 	
 	
 		that means mud in the road yep
 	
 	
 		there's <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mud</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> there's <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mud</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sidewalk</ENAMEX> there's <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mud</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> i mean you just can't get away from it and of course it's been you know ideal weather for grass to grow
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		oh sure
 	
 	
 		and unfortunately they haven't gotten around to put they you know they were waiting until they got i think the other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> on the cul-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">de</ENAMEX>-sac on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> done before they're going to plant all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">grass</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time
 	
 	
 		what what do you do you put in up there do you i mean here we know we know <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> grasses <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint Augustine</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bermuda</ENAMEX> uh what what do you normally put in up there
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		you can put in any number of grasses up here uh a lot <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> like the red fescue they like to mix red fescue in with uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kentucky Blue</ENAMEX> um the uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">favorite</ENAMEX> is uh a zoysia grass uh when i lived in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laura</ENAMEX> which is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about sixty miles</NUMEX> south of where i'm living now
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh that my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX> had it and i was forever trying to get you know decent grass to grow in my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">yard</ENAMEX> and he talked me into trying to some plugs of the zoysia and i just loved it because the zoysia you can uh you can quite literally just plug it around the yard
 		and it just spreads and it chokes out the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">weeds</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">weeds</ENAMEX> can't get in there and so you don't have to weed and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">feed</ENAMEX> and do all that other crazy stuff you just you know the only bad part about it is during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the winter</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">grass</ENAMEX> is brown but i mean you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh that happens here too
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> of course we got uh we had a very mild <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter this year</TIMEX> with very little freeze
 		uh so we didn't have any problem uh uh with the uh uh with the grass greening up quickly you know <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> it was well into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX> before all the bare spots got covered
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> because of the of the severe <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> that we had around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eighty nine</NUMEX> but <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> it uh
 		we did have some cold <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> but not down in the single digits or anything like that so when things started greening up in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX> they greened up and everybody's <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">grass</ENAMEX> is is
 		is perfectly green do your <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> you say you moved into a new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> normally built there with central air conditioning is that part of the uh the standard for a home
 	
 	
 		yes pretty much standard now
 	
 	
 		oh okay i i didn't know whether you were far enough south for that of course i'm i'm from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New England</ENAMEX> my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> are there and it's it's unheard of there i guess anybody that wants air conditioning goes out and puts a window <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> in
 	
 	
 		well the uh the thing about uh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maryland</ENAMEX> is um <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last few years</TIMEX> uh since i've been back and uh it was like that oh it started this way about mid seventies
 		um we started having a very abbreviated Spring
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you would go  from having fifty <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixty</TIMEX> degree days right into the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eighty eighty five</NUMEX> degree days which you know in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> it's not bad because the humidity is real low but here when the temperature is eighty degrees the humidity is eighty
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		no
 		yeah the humidity is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">eighty degrees</NUMEX> along with it
 	
 	
 		and eighty <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">per cent</NUMEX> and and and worse i mean i've seen <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> here when the humidity is like <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ninety three a hundred</NUMEX> per <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">cent</NUMEX> and it's just absolutely the worst feeling in the whole world
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-hum
 		yeah i'm i'm aware of that did you have a very severe winter
 	
 	
 		uh not really we had uh a couple uh real good snow storms uh but they were the kind that came stayed for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of days</TIMEX> and then melted off and that's the best kind to have around here
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		okay
 		yeah yeah we we had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> snow here in fact we haven't had any measurable accumulation now in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six or seven years</TIMEX> uh
 	
 	
 		yeah i remember the uh ice storm back in uh nineteen <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eighty eight</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah that was a nice one too that was an ice storm there and uh uh i remember one year
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i can't tell you the exact year it was probably about uh eighty seventy <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> or eighty that we had such a severe ice storm that it uh knocked tree limbs down on the wires and there were some uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four hundred thousand</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> out of electricity
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		and i know it was after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seventy eight</TIMEX> because we built our home here in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seventy eight</TIMEX> and it was a new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">development</ENAMEX> that didn't have any trees yet so we had electricity and we had fifteen <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> camped out on our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX> in sleeping bags
 	
 	
 		jeez
 	
 	
 		and and unfortunately when it thawed then most everybody's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> got filled with water too  and uh but we we were fortunate <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that year</TIMEX> and even at that this development was built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seventy eight</TIMEX> and even now all all the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utilities</ENAMEX> run under ground
 	
 	
 		oh God
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so there's still no big <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> in the development but the uh uh all all the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utilities</ENAMEX> so we we wouldn't have to look forward to that but we had a uh we had a mild <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> as i say the previous year
 		we had <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three or four days</TIMEX> uh it it wasn't much it was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">only about a week</TIMEX> and i think it was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the week</TIMEX> just prior to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> when the temperature got down into the single digits
 		and as a result a lot of the the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> and uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">grass</ENAMEX> and shrubbery was killed uh was killed out and at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this time last year</TIMEX> nothing looked very good but it it does right now uh at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this time last year</TIMEX>
 		we were under water most of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> was under water uh if you remember uh uh uh downtown <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> you could go down and look up in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Reunion Tower</ENAMEX> and look over toward the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trinity River</ENAMEX> and it looked like lakes not a river
 	
 	
 		yes
 		yeah i remember that
 	
 	
 		and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh Lake Texoma</ENAMEX> was up uh <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">twenty feet</NUMEX> over flood level
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		uh at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at this time last  year</TIMEX> it was it was uh it was pretty bad but uh i'm i'm hoping you know you you don't want anything to flood but you want to get normal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rain</ENAMEX> and uh we're probably some where near normal right now
 	
 	
 		yeah i noticed uh <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">tonight</TIMEX> when i was out driving around that the uh the one of the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">reservoirs</ENAMEX> in the county i live in is uh fuller that i've ever seen it i mean it's it's up over its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX> but it's not that far over its banks
 	
 	
 		how long have you been back in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maryland</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">uh</ENAMEX> moved back here in uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eighty nine</NUMEX>
 		yes so i spent <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two uh</TIMEX> just <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about two years</TIMEX> exactly in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eighty nine</NUMEX> okay
 		yeah and where did you say you lived in Plano
 	
 	
 		uh yeah i lived in Plano
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">um</ENAMEX> worked at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spring Creek</ENAMEX> for a while and was on the moon job and then when my clearance came through for APD i worked for DSEG uh worked at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North Billings</ENAMEX> for a while and then down at <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Love Field</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 		oh okay okay that's a nice <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spring Creek</ENAMEX> isn't it that's the that's the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Taj Mahal</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> facilities
 	
 	
 		oh God
 		i tell you it spoils you rotten to work there you
 		you work there and they send you any place else it's like you've been demoted
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well well we're in the i don't know if you're familiar with the center complex
 		uh in in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> it's across <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LBJ</ENAMEX> from the main <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> site it's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> glass <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> and that for someone that's been at <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty two years</TIMEX> this is kind of unTI like too
 	
 	
 		right
 		i had a uh a uh an employee that i hired there Lita Mytek
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lita Mytek</ENAMEX> i mean she uh she worked over in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Center Three i</ENAMEX> think it was and uh you know she said she liked it over there
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i'm in i'm in center <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> the big thing that i think other than the fact that we've all got double the size <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> we've ever had anywhere else and it's so quiet that you can hear a pin drop to me the big advantage and i didn't realize it when we came over here is the covered parking
 		it is amazing in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the middle of the summer</TIMEX> when it's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred and ten</NUMEX> out to go out and be able to get into your <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> and touch the steering wheel
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		which we could never do parked outside of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SC Building</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">South Building</ENAMEX> or various other places that i've i worked and and you notice the finish on your <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> lasts <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">longer</TIMEX> when you wash it it stays clean longer
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">uh it is</ENAMEX> is uh uh to me to me that's that's probably one of the biggest advantages that we've got over there plus i'm in center <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> and the credit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">union</ENAMEX> is down on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> floor
 		and it seems that i'm always always there i've got a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> away from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">college</ENAMEX> away at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">college</ENAMEX> that's always out of money so it's easy i can get down to the credit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">union</ENAMEX> quite often and uh are you looking forward to a hot <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> there now
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um i'd i'd prefer it not to be that hot
 		uh the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the days</TIMEX> usually aren't aren't that bad um it's just when the humidity gets up i mean it's like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX> we had a day it was i think it was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">eighty degrees</NUMEX> but the humidity for some strange reason was only nineteen <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">per cent</NUMEX> and that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh that that's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> like
 	
 	
 		yeah that was a rarity for here and God it was just beautiful
 	
 	
 		that's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> like
 		did you ever get out to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Midland</ENAMEX> while you were here
 	
 	
 		no i never did
