 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		well this is going to be very boring boring because i don't
 	
 	
 		hi
 		you don't at all
 	
 	
 		no and uh unfortunately it shows i uh
 		i'm supposed to i'm way overweight
 		but uh i've had a problem with uh high blood pressure which of course is directly connected to it and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX>'s trying to get my blood pressure under control
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		before i start in any exercising
 	
 	
 		or too much of it yeah yeah you need
 	
 	
 		so anyway i did join the uh
 		uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Texans</ENAMEX>
 		up at uh
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">uh Springcreek</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i've been up there a few times
 		but didn't accomplish too much because i just run down too quick
 	
 	
 		yeah i haven't been up there um but i understand they've got a nice <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pool</ENAMEX> and that's my favorite form of exercise is swimming
 	
 	
 		uh that would have to be mine i hate exercising it's so boring
 	
 	
 		really
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh i would much prefer to like walk through the woods
 	
 	
 		oh yeah most of my my forms of exercise come in the form of a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five year old</TIMEX> and a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two year</TIMEX> old
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh running after them or going biking with them or just exploring you know on a little exploration exploration hike you know through the neighborhood it's amazing you know how many earthworms you can find and
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and to a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five year old</TIMEX> they're they never get old you know an earthworm every single time she finds <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> it's uh it's a brand new exciting activity for her
 	
 	
 		isn't it amazing
 	
 	
 		um-hum it really is
 	
 	
 		well we um
 		back when my my i have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sons</ENAMEX> they're all grown <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">now and</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of them are married with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> of their own but
 		when they were just uh pre <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teenagers</ENAMEX> we um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		we decided the only way we could afford vacations is to go camping
 	
 	
 		oh yeah isn't it great
 	
 	
 		and we thoroughly enjoyed it i mean we went whole hog we had the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tents</ENAMEX> and everything else and and pretty much roughed it
 		sleeping on the ground and all
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh i like to think that my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sons</ENAMEX> learned a lot about uh the outdoors uh uh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> being self-sustaining
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh uh i would have no doubt what so ever that any one of them could be dropped in the middle of no where and they'd they'd exist
 		exist somehow
 	
 	
 		well that's neat my uh my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> was uh was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy scout</ENAMEX> and he uh actually went very far in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy scouts</ENAMEX> and he was in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Order of the Arrow</ENAMEX> and he absolutely
 		um you know the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">earth</ENAMEX> is is part of him
 		and he is part of it and i think that's a real important thing and we we enjoy going camping we haven't yet had them sleeping on the ground primarily because
 		to them uh or to the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five year old the two year old</TIMEX> would freak out about it but she wouldn't quite get totally unnerved but the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five year old</TIMEX> still has a fear of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">spiders</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i'm afraid that if she woke up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> with her we would have to pack up and come home  so we've primarily done our camping by cabin up at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Turner Falls</ENAMEX> up in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oklahoma</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh wow well okay that is understandable
 		oh yes i'm very familiar with it very beautiful place
 	
 	
 		isn't that a beautiful place
 	
 	
 		i've been up there several times
 	
 	
 		well it was up there actually that she got her fear of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">spiders</ENAMEX> because we sat and watched a tarantula for a long time we we you know we'd never seen one
 	
 	
 		oh what a shame
 	
 	
 		or she had never seen one we my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> and i had but she we'd never seen one as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> and so we just sat and watched it for the longest time it was you know removed from us by probably <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">six feet</NUMEX>
 		so we weren't concerned about it and we just sat and watched it and we explained you know how it did well that <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> she had a nightmare and she has been terrified of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">spiders</ENAMEX> since
 		but we still go up there and we still have a great time
 	
 	
 		well good i'm glad to hear that about the only thing uh i might suggest is
 		uh do the same thing again introduce her to a to a spider at a reasonable distance where she isn't frightened
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh and that that that the the nightmare i'm sure was just a a freak
 		i'll bet it wouldn't happen again
 	
 	
 		i think not yeah i think it was you know being in a new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">place</ENAMEX> being kind of out of out of sorts and everything all combined but
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		we uh that's you you know that's our favorite form of exercise is is life and we do our own yard you know we uh we we enjoy the activities that provide exercise
 		both of us would love to exercise on a routine basis but our life doesn't um really have that much time in it so we just enjoy what we can along with our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> you know
 	
 	
 		well that you couldn't pick a better way of doing it
 		with your family
 	
 	
 		well
 		yeah we have a
 	
 	
 		and and you're you're certainly all getting an education while you're
 		doing this exercise
 	
 	
 		that's kind of how we feel about it we can't you know there's
 		there's there's things that uh the only thing that is forever is the earth well  we hope it's forever yeah and uh and you know therefore
 	
 	
 		as far as we're concerned
 	
 	
 		it you know the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> can learn things in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> about everything that is temporary but as far as really knowing the earth there's no other way to really learn it but to experience it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and we really have a great time with it i'm sure that's the way that you felt with your boys
 	
 	
 		oh definitely definitely it was a learning experience uh
 		now we i guess we camped just about every public campground in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX>'s absolutely wonderful for that i understand i've i've never lived there
 	
 	
 		oh yes yes yell they used to be but now they're trying to really
 		put it to the the the uh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> i think they're doing a very stupid thing
 	
 	
 		oh with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Walt Disney World</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		well they charge extra now they there was a time here <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few years ago</TIMEX> when they put an extra tax on all the campgrounds and the uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">motels</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hotels</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		so they are are uh you know really putting it to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> got a little fed up with it and they suddenly and suddenly the the foundling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fathers</ENAMEX> of uh of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> found out that they were losing beaucoup bucks
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> were going elsewhere for uh their vacations
 	
 	
 		by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>
 		they were trying to turn it too much into a business
 	
 	
 		exactly so they got rid of that tax in a hurry
 	
 	
 		oh that's good we've uh not been brave enough yet to brave that trip with these with the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>  i mean you know in the car
 	
 	
 		uh yeah i can appreciate that
 	
 	
 		it's it's uh it's you know getting up to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Turner Falls</ENAMEX> or uh up to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lake Murray</ENAMEX> is about as far as we've really tried to go in a car we have gone down and uh
 		uh gone down to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">New Braunfels uh San</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">well</ENAMEX> we were headed down to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sea World</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Antonio</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh we stopped along the way and enjoyed ourselves along the way but um you know that's that's pretty much as far as we've tried with little ones
 	
 	
 		well the the trick is to stop frequently and let the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> get out and run
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		now uh i'm alone now myself and and i
 		i have graduated from sleeping on the ground to uh going in a motor home
 	
 	
 		oh um-hum
 	
 	
 		well the fact i live in it and there's just my <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> and i now my <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> is a wonderful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traveler</ENAMEX> but i do have to stop for her quite frequently
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and it works out fine i mean i stop i'm never in a hurry to get anywhere
 	
 	
 		and no reason to be
 	
 	
 		like
 		it takes me <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two days</TIMEX> to get to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Memphis</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and that's that's not terribly far
 	
 	
 		no it's uh it's <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about an eight or nine hour</NUMEX> drive really
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh i make it in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two days</TIMEX> because i i don't push it
 	
 	
 		well there's so many neat places along the way i mean you've got <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arkansas</ENAMEX> you know and
 	
 	
 		oh definitely oh absolutely incidentally oh i can't remember the name of that place there's a beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> up there
 		and they do have a uh uh oh sort of a hotel a lodge a lodge that's what it is
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and it's just off the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">interstate</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> would love it because they have <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">playgrounds</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and all and they have uh several nature trails
 	
 	
 		it's just off the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">interstate</ENAMEX> that goes through <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hot Springs</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh it's just below <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hot Springs</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um okay
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		well that wouldn't even be a very far drive
 	
 	
 		it's lake something
 	
 	
 		i'm not i i ought to look into it uh because we were kind of
 		entertaining entertaining the thought of taking a uh you know like just a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five or six day</TIMEX> trip in the not too distant future to kind of kick off the summer
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i
 	
 	
 		well the next time you go across the state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">line</ENAMEX> or when you come back in be sure and stop at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		welcome bureaus
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and ask them for their literature on the the uh state national <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and you'll you'll get a collection from them the you wouldn't believe there were so many <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX> in the state
 	
 	
 		i probably wouldn't and i've lived here all of my life
 	
 	
 		well it it there there are so many for instance have you ever been out to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tyler State Park</ENAMEX>
