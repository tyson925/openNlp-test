 
     		
 	
 		so uh i don't know what you mean by camping but i mean tent kind of camping i guess that's what i normally do that's what
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah well do you
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah nothing like <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">RVs</ENAMEX> or anything like that
 	
 	
 		because uh  my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> and i in like back in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eighty three</NUMEX> we went camping uh camping down the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appalachian Trail</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh really the whole length or uh
 	
 	
 		no no uh it was just for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three days</TIMEX> we must have done like uh <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">sixty miles</NUMEX> or something
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		um-hum was it very crowded out there or
 	
 	
 		no no not at all but uh you had uh you know there was one part like we were waiting to get some water right and we were looking at where we could get some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> and it said you know it was like
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		we can either try to get here <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">tonight</TIMEX> or just sleep it and try to get there <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> and we said okay let's just sleep in and try to get there <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and so when we got there  the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> that we were supposed to drink wasn't potable like well you couldn't drink it
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and so what we had to do is we had to get on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">trail</ENAMEX> or on the road
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and start walking down the road and then we found this little hut <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a couple of miles</NUMEX> down that had you know that sold stuff
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so we just stopped there uh you know had some breakfast got some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> and kept on walking
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		and then uh my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> who went to pick us up we had a barbecue and it was it was cool it was like you know you see a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">deer</ENAMEX> up there
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh like one time i opened up the the tent and there was a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">deer drinking</ENAMEX> out of a stream
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		and so it was it was cool you know and and it was just uh very tiring though
 	
 	
 		yeah the last the last big camping trip i was on was uh probably <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few years</TIMEX> after that but it was in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pagosa Springs</ENAMEX> area in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colorado</ENAMEX> a bunch of us uh from here went up there and uh
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		and i got hit by the same thing because we thought we were going to be real mountain <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and uh we got up there and we had the little <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pills</ENAMEX> you're supposed to put in the water and make sure that it's potable
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		and of course we're up you know up above you know <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fourteen</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">thousand feet</NUMEX> or whatever and we said well well how dirty could the water be right you never never think about <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> or amoeba or anything like that
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		you think well nobody's using the bathroom farther up stream so it's got to be all right so we were doing things like uh
 		you know we all had our little collapsible cups and we were going up to where the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> was coming over rocks and all that and we'd just kind of stick our cups in there and drink and then we were there for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five or six days</TIMEX> and and and it was neat you know we saw <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">deer</ENAMEX> and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		had to put our uh food up in the in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> and all that i was the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">unlucky guy</ENAMEX> that got up <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">every morning</TIMEX> and said well i guess might as well putz around here while everyone else is sleeping so i was usually the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> who had to get it out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> and all that
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		yeah i was uh i told my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> you know it was like listen <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> you know that i sleep a lot of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> right
 	
 	
 		
  
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and so he goes yeah i do okay so he goes you know at least i sleep you know maybe <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten hours</TIMEX> so if we go to bed at you know <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> or something right
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		so he goes well if you go to bed at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> then you'll wake up like <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		and then i go no no maybe i sleep <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">more than ten hours</TIMEX> you know and
 	
 	
 		that's that's right you don't want to be the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> one up and have to put the fire on and have to take take care of everything while everyone else is sacked out
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and then if they wake up and you haven't done everything it's like why haven't you done that but uh well we were drinking you know back to that uh water thing and of course i got sick
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		about the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the day</TIMEX> i'm i'm uproariously sick and i'm in the tent sweating it out
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> i was with they were like well this you're a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wimp</ENAMEX> you know because we've been drinking out of the water and we're okay so they went out fly fishing and they're having a great time
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and and just all the way back to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> i'm just uproariously sick and uh we get back here and of course <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first day</TIMEX> back at work i go to work and where are these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and they were off both off a week sick because they were just it's just like it took them a little longer to hit it hit and it hit them and they were just like calling into work going oh i'm miserable i'm i'm just
 	
 	
 		
 
 		it hit them wham
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i can't keep anything down i'm and i just cramps and i'm just going hey tell me about it right
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh but uh that was probably the last big <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camp</ENAMEX> that's probably the last big camping trip i've i've gone on i haven't gone in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few years</TIMEX> on anything real big
 	
 	
 		what uh do you work for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh no no but i know somebody who does and that's how i got into this so but uh
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		but in fact it's funny that's this was the topic because i was just reading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Outside Magazine</ENAMEX> here <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this morning</TIMEX> and uh and that some big issue on the only way to camp about about canoe camping
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh and i've i've done a lot of canoeing but never have camped out over <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> and and they makes a lot make a lot of good points about at least with a canoe you don't have to carry everything
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you can throw big tents and food and and stoves and everything in and all you have to do is just you don't even have to if you go downstream you hardly even have to paddle and it's uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well it all depends on what the rapids are like
 	
 	
 		well that's true too as long as you're not going to going to hit any white <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> or you know if you're just doing a nice calm river it's uh it's it uh you don't have to put very much effort into it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> i guess as i get older that'll get more and more appetizing
 	
 	
 		
 
 		and then all you'll have will be road camping trips you know let's just go out to the mountains with the car <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">honey</ENAMEX> and uh
 	
 	
 		the truck and
 		that's that's right
 		and uh and if we're lucky we'll talk somebody into taking the car downstream and we'll just throw the canoe in there and uh and uh tell you what we'll just we'll just float downstream and uh that's that's
 	
 	
 		yeah really
 		
  
 		no paddling no paddling we'll just grab the rudder and you you work the rudder yeah
 	
 	
 		that's about as tough as nope that's
 		just keep us off a rock and we'll just let the let the stream take us down river and all that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh but uh well you over there in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Carolina North Carolina</ENAMEX> you probably get a lot of chance to you've got a lot of rivers and a lot of uh white white <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> over there i think uh-huh
 	
 	
 		yeah but since
 		but i'm a you know i'm a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> and so
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i also don't have any transportation
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and so the the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that actually do camp do camp i don't i don't really get along with them
 		you know they're like i don't know if i could stand to being you know <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two days</TIMEX> in the woods with them you know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah yeah that's probably true because uh that's
 	
 	
 		and so because you have to know who you're going with to get along
 	
 	
 		that's true you can't even uh because i know uh even i and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> would probably uh have a hard time sitting in sitting out in the woods for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of days</TIMEX>
 		and uh you've really got to be careful who you go out there with and that they're out they're out fo r what they're doing and you're out for what you want to do and then you all get get to do what you want to do i guess while you're out there but uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		oh well
 	
 	
 		well well all right bye bye
 	
 	
 		it was nice talking to you
 		bye bye
