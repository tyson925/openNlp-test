 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		okay uh the question was about uh physical fitness and staying in shape and exercise well uh i i don't do it as much as i should i try to walk
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> i would i did it <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX> but i've kind of in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ninety one</NUMEX> i've kind of gone down hill
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and so i'm not doing it as much as i need to but i i can tell you when i do do it on a regular basis i feel so much better and so much healthier
 	
 	
 		i agree
 	
 	
 		but it's just to get motivated to do it and once i get started and and i i i can i do it <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">every night</TIMEX> it's just to get uh motivated motivated again and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		what happened <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about couple of weeks ago</TIMEX> i started again and um
 		i was walking and it got kind of dark and i was by myself and there was this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fellow</ENAMEX> in this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">truck</ENAMEX> that kept circling the block
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		ooh
 	
 	
 		and so i i kind of got frightened and i kind of use that as an excuse All i have to do is start <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX>  but i haven't walked since so
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right
 		it's always easy to find an excuse not to exercise i know what you mean
 	
 	
 		
 
 		it sure is it sure is it sure is how about you do you exercise on a regular basis
 	
 	
 		um well i try to um i started at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the beginning of this year</TIMEX> i decided all right i'm going to start exercising again i'm going to be real good and i went through the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> fitness <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> and registered for the uh aerobics <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX> there
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and they run for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two months</TIMEX> at a time and you have to you do have to pay to take them and i took i signed up for one that was <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three nights</TIMEX> a week <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an hour and a half</TIMEX> so that was <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">four and a half hours</TIMEX> a week
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and it cost <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixty</TIMEX> dollars and i thought okay that's not cheap that'll encourage me to always go since i spent that much money and i had a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> of mine going so i was real good i only missed it <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about three</NUMEX> times
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and then oh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX> came around and i signed up again and i got uh caught up with a class i was taking at <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> and then i was having to work some real <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">late hours</TIMEX> to get caught with my work after i got out of class and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		then i went to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colorado Springs</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next week</TIMEX> to do some training at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> up there and so that was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks</TIMEX> i had missed and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> i tell you what i've been terrible ever since then
 	
 	
 		yeah it's once you get out of that habit you just don't you don't get back into it because i teach <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> a bunch of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> had an aerobics <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> we went in together and hired a private <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">instructor</ENAMEX> and she came to our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> twice a week
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i i was i would go faithfully and then i missed once then i went back again <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a couple</NUMEX> times and missed another time and then kept missing and never went back again i think if you you just have to stick with it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		oh yeah i think i've been <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> maybe <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the month of April</TIMEX> and this session is about to run out now i signed up for a different one now that's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">only two nights a week</TIMEX> because i am getting kind of
 		into a real a busy schedule as far as teaching a lot of training classes and some of them require me to go out of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> and and uh that just kind of throws my whole schedule off when am doing that so
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i've lately yeah there's been <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nights</TIMEX> that i could have gone and i've found excuses uh  things like i i had the flu <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX> but i'm fine <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</TIMEX> i could have gone <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> i could have gone <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">tonight</TIMEX> and i didn't so i'm kind of
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		kind of finding excuses and now it's kind of like well this is the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX> i'll just start fresh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next week</TIMEX> but i better do better do it and i think another thing is that my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> that was taking with me <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first two months</TIMEX>
 		wasn't <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the second two months</TIMEX> she started taking tennis lessons and so i haven't had that extra motivation of of us forcing each other or not forcing each other but encouraging each other to go so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		sure yeah that makes a difference when you have somebody to go with and to do the same the same thing like it's misery loves <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> i don't really love exercise i mean some i the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX> across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> she goes belongs to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">President's</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh it's not <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX>'s any more i don't know what the name of it is anymore but uh she loves it i mean she it's just it's an automatic high for her she just enjoys it so much and i don't
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah i'm the same way
 	
 	
 		i'm i feel good after i do it but i hate it when i'm doing it you know i just i don't enjoy it at all and she just loves it so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it even when she doesn't go to the health <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">club</ENAMEX> she runs you know and it's a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> thing for her so it you know and it's so hard for me i envy her i wish i could be that way but i don't
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		i do too
 	
 	
 		i don't and i have an older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> that loves running too and she runs all the time
 		but at to me it's <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">every minute</TIMEX>'s agony and i in fact i don't run i hate to run like when i walk i'll take along a radio or something and that helps you know pass the time
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		right yeah walking is kind of boring i do have a few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> that live in my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment complex</ENAMEX> in this neighborhood and we try to
 		we used to try to get together and i think now that the weather's getting nicer we're going to start doing it again and occasionally go walking there's a real nice residential area right behind our apartment <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and it's not as boring if you get several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and you can kind of talk and
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		and it it makes it pass pretty quickly and the aerobics isn't too boring i kind of enjoy it when i'm doing it
 		um it's it's a lot more fun than some other things i could do i guess but uh i do i do have to make myself go and of course while i'm doing it i feel pretty good and after i get finished i feel great
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		oh it's great afterwards yeah
 	
 	
 		i mean i can go in there i can be like a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> when i'm tired it's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the week</TIMEX> and i just want to go home and i'll make myself go and i'll have headache and everything and i get out i don't have a headache any more i feel great and i'm just
 		it's amazing how much better i feel and then just in general i sleep a lot better and i just feel much better i mean i've been kind of dragging the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last few weeks</TIMEX> and i know if i would just get around to exercising
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah that's right
 		exactly it does it gives you energy
 	
 	
 		i'd feel feel better but my dragginess is my excuse for not exercising well i'm too tired or i have a headache or well i just got over the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">flu</ENAMEX> and i'm still kind of draggy so i better not go
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 		it's kind of a vicious circle isn't it yeah i find too that i have more energy when i exercise and i and uh you know it's silly not to but i don't know
 	
 	
 		yeah it really is
 	
 	
 		it's just a put off i don't know why i don't do more and i and i know that it's good for my health i know you know from everything that you read and you see on television now exercise is so important to good health
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		so you know you not only you know you're not only doing something to keep yourself fit but you're probably prolonging your life so there's no reason that we shouldn't do it but i don't know
 	
 	
 		right
 		it's just hard to make yourself go and i i think one thing i don't like about aerobics is that after i'm finished it's kind of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">late at night</TIMEX> and i've been sweaty and and it you know i don't really feel like going in the grocery <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX> all sweaty or running errands so it kind of kills the
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the evening</TIMEX> for doing errands so i think a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday Thursday</TIMEX> might be a little bit better of course i feel like once i've done it if i'm sweaty i might as well do an extra <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">more minutes</TIMEX> because you've already kind of shot <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">your</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> but
 	
 	
 		that's
 		yeah
 		right
 	
 	
 		but um so i'm kind of glad they have a longer class on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday Thursday</TIMEX> now that i can just kill <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two nights</TIMEX> and and uh get a reasonable amount of workout in so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		does it cost the same for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">just two nights</TIMEX> or
 	
 	
 		no it's less expensive this one was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">only forty five dollars</NUMEX> but i'm glad it's not too totally cheap because if it was too c heap i would talk myself out of going more probably
 	
 	
 		well that's good too
 		sure yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		since it's more expensive i think okay you spent that much money you'd better go
 	
 	
 		that's right that's right well do you have a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> right at the where you work
 	
 	
 		so hopefully
 		yeah yeah it's right there and it's they have a really nice <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> they've got <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different aerobics <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> they have the mirrors of course
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		sometimes you don't like to see the mirrors on the wall you don't like to see how you work but i guess sometimes it kind of motivates you to really get going but
 	
 	
 		no
 		yeah
 		and then they hire private <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">instructors</ENAMEX> they have oh that's great
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		and they have ceiling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fans</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> and it's it's a pretty nice setup um and of course it's real convenient because it is right there at work i think if i had to come home and then go somewhere i'd never make it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and just the fact that i can just go straight from my desk over to the the recreation <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> and do it helps a lot
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah i can see that would be uh easy they make it as easy as they possibly can for you
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		well um do a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> take advantage of it
 	
 	
 		quite a few do they have probably ooh i'd say fifteen different fifteen to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twenty</NUMEX> different aerobics <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX> each session that are running and they have them <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">anywhere from six</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX> uh they have some during
 		during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">lunch hour</TIMEX> that are shorter and i guess <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> can take advantage of that for me i wouldn't have time to do <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an hour hour</TIMEX> of aerobics and then take a shower and get get dressed again but there's a lot more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> that do that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> and um
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		they have them you know in the in the evenings they even have some <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">late night</TIMEX> ones for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that work <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">second</TIMEX> shift and things like that so they have big variety they even have some uh
 		aerobic uh water aerobics when the weather gets nice out in the pool i've never done that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> before but
 	
 	
 		oh you have a pool there too oh how nice
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		they've got an <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">olympic pool and and basketball</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX> and sand volleyball they've got the full weight <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> and
 		uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">locker rooms</ENAMEX> with uh a jacuzzi and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sauna</ENAMEX> and the shower <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hair dryers</ENAMEX> and all the you know everything you'd need just about
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		it's a real it is a real nice <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> it's also got a full inside inside basketball <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> and i think they're working on building a jogging track and some other things but it's it is very nice
 	
 	
 		that's great
 	
 	
 		i just don't take as much advantage of it as i should i mean i'm just now finally starting to do the aerobics thing but
 	
 	
 		now to use
 		well does it cost money like to use the to exercise in the weight <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> or to uh to take to go swimming do you have to pay for that too
 	
 	
 		yeah well you can get a fitness <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">membership</ENAMEX> that allows you to use the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> and it's <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about eight dollars</NUMEX> a month
 	
 	
 		oh that's not bad huh-uh
 	
 	
 		no not at all  pretty cheap
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		so and then the aerobics cost extra even if you have the fitness membership but
 		i think the aerobics <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX> are even pretty reasonably priced from what i've heard
 	
 	
 		i think so too yeah yeah
 		well and and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of all ages take advantage of the aerobics
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of all ages take advantage of the aerobics
 	
 	
 		oh yeah in fact uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T TIer</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> can can come in on these things
