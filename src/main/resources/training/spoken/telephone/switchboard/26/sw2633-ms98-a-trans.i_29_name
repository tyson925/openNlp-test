 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		do you have uh personal experience involving child care services
 	
 	
 		well about the only thing i know is uh one of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">um friends</ENAMEX> at work uh has um one little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> and she's about to have a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> and i hear some of her um
 		tales about trying to get uh child care now she doesn't like to use some of the places like <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">um Kinder Care La Petite Academy</ENAMEX> she likes to just find <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> you know who take <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> into their home
 	
 	
 		right
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh you know sometimes they have found somebody by word of mouth other times she has to go through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX> and see what she can find
 		there are some um like um oh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chamber of Commerce</ENAMEX> you can kind of call there are some places like that that will give you some referrals at least
 		but she just kind of goes and uh meets <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that she sees advertise and and interviews with them and ask them their
 	
 	
 		i have a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> at work yeah who whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> does that she takes in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> and i think they're regulated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> as to how many they can take in at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ways</ENAMEX>
 		oh
 		ah
 	
 	
 		so i'm not sure how anybody checks up on that but um i think there's a maximum number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> that they can take care of at any one time
 	
 	
 		yeah there's been a few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that have kind of used the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> kind of like word of mouth <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> had them and
 		then um you know other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> had followed and had the same <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> as their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> grows like some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> only want little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> you know and when they get to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years old</TIMEX>
 		they don't want you know a whole lot of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years old</TIMEX> because they're a little more active so they you know a lot <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> seem to have used like the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> as their their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> uh grow but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i really keep thinking that T I ought to come up with something like through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texins</ENAMEX> to have you know some kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> there at work because it really is uh a lot of extra pressure on our working parents
 	
 	
 		do you think it ought to be subsidized by the company
 	
 	
 		no i think it should be done through <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Texans</ENAMEX> i mean i understand that
 	
 	
 		something you can sign up for and pay
 	
 	
 		that that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> wouldn't want to have liability for that and i can understand that i work in the legal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> i don't want anymore lawsuits than what we got
 	
 	
 		sure
 		right no i don't think that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> should be subsidizing services like that
 	
 	
 		but but you know i think they could work out something with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Texans</ENAMEX> something that would be close to work
 		because i think that would help ease things too if you've got your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> somewhere close because i see these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> you know dashing out the door
 		um have to be out by a certain time because they have to go pick up their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> if they don't pick up the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> by a certain time then they run extra money you know  to uh have late charges
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		and uh you know <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Texins</ENAMEX> is is not uh well i don't think it's
 		really directly supported by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> i think it has it's own kind of funding but something like that that you know you would have to be a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> or a Texins kind of um does it
 	
 	
 		yeah i think that would take care of any questions about competency for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> running the show
 		uh if say if you were in in a situation having to locate a uh child care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">center</ENAMEX> how old you go about determining whether somebody was competent or not take care of your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>
 		i think that's a big question
 	
 	
 		well how would i do that
 	
 	
 		yeah you um pretty much by word of mouth uh somebody recommends somebody else but if you didn't know anybody uh how how lengthy an interview would you conduct with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> taking care of your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> to determine whether they're fit to uh handle it
 	
 	
 		well uh again i know from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> who um you know is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> ever mine at work
 		she and i i've talked to her after she's interviewed some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> just really sound i mean bizarre i mean you can't imagine that these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are putting in for um you know minding other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> um like if you could go to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and
 		it seems to be in a disarray and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> really isn't even dressed and it's <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> and and you ask her about you know previous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and she won't talk about it
 	
 	
 		yeah uh-huh
 	
 	
 		kind of go okay um
 		others if they have some way of handling like i kind of wonder about these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> who take in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> there are times that you're going to have to do you know for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> they're going to have to do some personal things themselves i mean
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every single day</TIMEX> they may have you know every once in a while they may have some kind of um personal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> appointment or got to get the car fixed or something like that how do they do that
 		so you ask them do you have a fall back you know for those times are you going to put me in a bind or do you have somebody else who can take care of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> or do those things for you on the times that you need to you know have personal time off and do those items
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and ask them you know who else uh have they you know <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> sat for in the past and can you talk to them look at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> and ask them what kind of things they do to you know during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> that kind of thing i guess
 	
 	
 		yeah there there are some services that uh
 		that are very expensive uh for uh typically subsidized by uh large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> for some of their uh uh important <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		where if they can't get there regular uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sitter</ENAMEX> or a child care service to take there <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> if they reserve slots with these other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">um companies</ENAMEX> um very expensive rates but they can drop their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX> off uh at uh one of these places for
 		so it i don't know what it cost but it's extremely expensive and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> uh have to uh reserve <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> number of slots uh per year they can't send anymore it's it's pretty much for for their
 	
 	
 		hm
 		hm
 	
 	
 		for their uh uh some some of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> do that a lot um i've heard about this type of service in uh places like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York City</ENAMEX> where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are uh real busy but if uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		if they can't find the regular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sitter</ENAMEX> they they if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> has uh slots available in this service uh these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> can drop their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> off there
 	
 	
 		hm oh do you know one time i um we just got married <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of years ago</TIMEX> and there was <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that were coming you know into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> with uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
 		and i wanted you know babysitters for uh the service and and available to them if they didn't want to bring their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> or you know get away and stuff and i just called in the from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yellow Pages</ENAMEX> you know a babysitter outfits that are
 		um again must have some kind of licensing or whatnot and uh just had them i mean
 		what i did was i had a babysitter during the service you know and and um anybody who had <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> could just you know take the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> to the nursery and i had somebody there everybody i knew was going to be at the wedding so i knew i had to find somebody i didn't know to do that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">um</ENAMEX> and it worked out okay i didn't know that there were services that you just called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yellow Pages</ENAMEX> and uh there's babysitters are us or something  and you say please i need one you know oh yeah no problem we'll send you out one
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">great</ENAMEX>
 		uh-huh do you have any idea what uh what the regular uh uh services cost like <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">La Petite or Kinder Care</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh i
 		thought i checked into it one time just pre planning
 		and it can run like a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">hundred dollars</NUMEX> a week i think my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> who now has a uh uh a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two and a half year old</TIMEX> she spends <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about fifty</NUMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixty</TIMEX> dollars per week for him so i think it's anywhere from like fifty to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred</NUMEX> depending on the place you take
 	
 	
 		i guess you have to weigh the financial benefit of having somebody else take care of your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> if uh the working <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> can uh make uh more than enough to handle that expense i guess it's worthwhile
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah it gets to be kind of expensive and i think you know some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> do uh weigh that um
 		we've had some that have had their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and not come back so it just depends i think uh well we have one now who um is is part time she works <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">half</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> well actually we have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">paralegal</ENAMEX> and one secretary
 		and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> each have very young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and now they are part timing it is kind of like a test to see how this will work to have these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> work part time
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh depending on the responsibilities that we're giving them and to see how that will workout because they all want to you know still have a little income to help out financially but they want to spend time with their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> so they're part timers
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and it for the one that's working with me it's working uh very well i don't have any problem with that i have one that's um helping me out at um for the litigation we're doing
 		and she's there uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three days a week</TIMEX> and this that seems to be fine i can handle that very well with her being there only <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> time
 	
 	
 		uh-huh i know some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> who are very career minded as soon as they have their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> they're back at work <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next week</TIMEX>  but
 	
 	
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next week</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah pretty much so but other other than that i know some also who's claim is that after they have their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> or started having <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> they're going to quit their job and uh dedicate their time to raising the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> right
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		according in in putting it in their words
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and staying at home so i don't know i guess each way has it's advantages
 	
 	
 		yeah well it's whatever they feel comfortable with you know basically whatever they feel best and there's probably some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> who
 		may not do their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> any good being there all the time because you know they they they can't uh quite see themselves you know dedicated that much
 		maybe they want to work a little bit whatever it is maybe they should think about do you really want a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> or not
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah good question
 	
 	
 		and maybe again you know their their you know their ideas change once the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> is there they go oh well you know now i like this a lot more than i thought i would
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cathlene</ENAMEX> the part timer she says you know she just doesn't she she's always one of these workaholic kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and she just really can't sit still enough
 		to just be home with the baby she has to have you know something else she's always been one who's put in
 		you know like the fifty to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixty</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hour</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">work week</TIMEX> and after she had the baby she was coming back in to check her <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> and to check her in box you know like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten days later</TIMEX> she was back in and we were like Cathlene you got <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two months</TIMEX> off you know you don't have to be back in there she's just
 		always back in there and she's a she she just finds it very hard to um you know tone that down even though she's a part timer she still will put in time on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
