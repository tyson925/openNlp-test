 
     		
 	
 		okay now uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> i live in uh they started a recycling program
 		uh in the certain small part of town a little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> neighborhoods neighborhoods
 		and they said that they were disappointed in the response that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> they tried to promote it and everything but i don't think the city necessarily supported what the they were doing uh
 	
 	
 		is this like roadside collection
 	
 	
 		yeah i don't think they really uh encouraged it i don't think they really uh made it well-known how to do it uh that's my perception
 		but
 	
 	
 		well now down here we've got you know collection bins in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX> and things but there's no
 		you know there's absolutely no
 	
 	
 		yeah there used to be uh a big uh trash bin several trash bins in front of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wal-Mart</ENAMEX> in town here that uh you could put plastic jugs on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> side and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX> on another and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glass</ENAMEX> on the third
 		but uh
 		that has been taken away it's not there anymore i mean that thing was always full because <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> really brought stuff to it all the time and uh then they took it away for no real reason that i can understand or i ever heard about
 		and it's not there anymore and the only place to take things to recycle them is like clear off on the other side of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> and who's going to do that very few people
 	
 	
 		that's right
 		well i've seen you know i've seen examples of uh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> where they
 		they take the other other approach you know you you have to do it or you're fined
 	
 	
 		is that right
 	
 	
 		and you know i'm actually all for that i don't i'm probably not the best
 		best <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> for recycling but i'll be damned if you know if they they didn't uh
 		charge me <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an extra ten</NUMEX> bucks for garbage collection <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every month</TIMEX> i'd be sure and recycle
 	
 	
 		yeah how how how do they monitor that though i wonder
 	
 	
 		i mean it's not that much trouble
 		it's just different different <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> that pass the laws that say you have to have to recycle
 		you have to you have to you know on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Mondays</TIMEX> they pick up <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glass</ENAMEX> and on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesdays</TIMEX> it's
 		you know <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plastics</ENAMEX> or whatever and if if you don't uh
 		if your garbage is just out there in a bag and it's not sorted you know they mark you down and
 		fine you for it shit it's kind of like
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		it's the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principal</ENAMEX> when there's a drought they fine you for using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> you know they just
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you don't do what they say and you
 		not that i promote over <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> or anything but you know the the world's in a bad enough state
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know i
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> being the way they are you kind of need some incentive
 	
 	
 		yeah it would definitely help you know even if they were to uh uh pay like for recycling <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aluminum</ENAMEX> or
 		uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX> or whatever i mean they used to be that if you well like grocery <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> you buy uh pop and and you had a deposit on the bottle you bring the bottle back you get <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a nickel</NUMEX> per bottle back or whatever you know that encourages you not to throw it away you'd take it back and and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right
 	
 	
 		and get your money back or at least exchange it for another bottle that's full you know
 	
 	
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		um i haven't seen that done for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a long time</TIMEX> either
 	
 	
 		yeah no deposit no return
 	
 	
 		yeah everything's no deposit no return or else it's all plastic jugs that you just pitch you know uh
 	
 	
 		i was listening to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karen DeNard</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the other night</TIMEX>
 		on the way <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> from school you know she's got that talk show and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		KRA
 		and they were talking about you know a lot of the plastic bottles
 		you can't just throw all <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plastics</ENAMEX> together
 	
 	
 		is that right
 	
 	
 		and they were talking about you know you need legislation to uh identify what kind of plastic it this is
 		what can be recycled as what
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		because you know say shampoo bottles i think was the example they gave there's no they don't even give you any indication of what kind of plastic that is
 		you just can't throw that in with your
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> liter <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Coke</ENAMEX> bottles or whatever
 	
 	
 		i wasn't aware of that i thought they were more or less all the same
 	
 	
 		yeah so did i that's that's it was news to me too i thought it was kind of interesting though
 	
 	
 		
 
 		there needs to be legislation that they should all be the same plastic
 	
 	
 		yeah they yeah that or you know things need might be identified and there needs to be a means a convenient means for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to to recycle i know for me now i've got to drive
 		<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a few miles</NUMEX> down the road to do it if i want to do it and a lot of times it's the difference between doing it or not doing it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know is
 		whether you can like take it out the back like stick it out in the back
 		back <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">alley</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> to pick up when they do or
 		having to throw it in the back of your car
 	
 	
 		or at least have you know a a bunch of collection bins around the city you know if they had one
 		for every <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five thousand</NUMEX> people
 		or or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two thousand</NUMEX> people
 		uh you know just scattered throughout the city you know who who wouldn't mind just you know why going down that way anyway just throw things in the back of your <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		and take them down and throw it in there i mean i think that would be great i i'd support that entirely
 		you know as a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> we produce way too much garbage it's it's it's phenomenal
 	
 	
 		yeah way too much well i know just as an individual you know i know how many times i haul out a bag of trash and it's like incredible if you multiply that times everybody
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		you know on my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">block</ENAMEX> in this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> it's crazy
 	
 	
 		where i work there they have uh uh recycled paper
 		thing so you just you have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> trash cans in your office one one is for the regular
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		non recyclable trash and is for paper yeah and you know i think it's great i use it all the time
 	
 	
 		yeah you're <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> right
 		yeah so am i
 	
 	
 		you know and i read that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> now save like what <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fifteen thousand</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> or whatever because of that and i thought that's great
 	
 	
 		yeah it is
 	
 	
 		you know
 	
 	
 		i guess there's the other side of the issue that uh there need to be <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> for processing all this stuff and a market for recyclable goods
 	
 	
 		uh yeah
 	
 	
 		and that was something they brought up on the show i listened to was uh
 		you know there's all kinds of you know recycled paper but you know nobody's wanting to use it
 	
 	
 		is that right
 	
 	
 		you know how many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are using how many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> do you know that use recycled paper in the office
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know you can you can buy your your <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moore</ENAMEX>'s computer forms for your computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> or whatever you can buy it with <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">regular</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> or recycled and
 		i'll guarantee you in my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> i haven't seen recycled paper yet
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so at the same time we're we're doing all this effort to throw it a way and recycle it we ought to be working on the other end and
 		and paying the extra dime on on a dollar for that recycled stuff
 	
 	
 		i've always wondered why they haven't taken some of these recycled <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plastics</ENAMEX> and made them into like uh plastic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boards</ENAMEX> to build a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> with instead of making it out of wood lumber make it out of out of plastic boards
 	
 	
 		well i think they actually do some of that but again it's the cost the cost of processing that it just
 	
 	
 		is that right
 	
 	
 		it intimidates <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> you know it's easier to buy something that's
 		you know the the the cost of building is already
 	
 	
 		once again the bottom line counts
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		for it it's easy to say but for a lot of people
 		to do you know if you were building a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and you were going to spend you know fifty <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousand</NUMEX> versus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twenty thousand</NUMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mat erials</ENAMEX> because your
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you're going to you're going to pay for uh technology that's not mature yet
 	
 	
 		yeah that that's a problem
 	
 	
 		what are you going to do you know you're going to spend <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty thousand</TIMEX> and
 	
 	
 		and then right it off
 	
 	
 		and
 		yeah you mean you're going to do what you can
 	
 	
 		that's right
 		well
 	
 	
 		but uh
 	
 	
 		that's about all i have to say <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">tonight</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		i was surprised i thought this thing was shut down but i
 	
 	
 		what's that
 	
 	
 		i thought this whole switchboard thing was shut down i was surprised to get the call
 	
 	
 		yeah so did i but i thought i'd try <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> more time and sure enough it's okay
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">great</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		well thanks for talking and
 	
 	
 		all right all right bye
 	
 	
 		see you later bye
