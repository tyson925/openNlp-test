 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX> and he gave to all his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> so my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX>'s even talked to and i've talked to several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Carolina</ENAMEX> i was just curious
 	
 	
 		that's yes yes that's true i've talked uh-huh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX> and and all over yeah
 	
 	
 		have you too
 		yeah i talked to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> and i asked him about it and he said oh he says i think i'm the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> that actually uh gave it to all my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> so that's why so many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are from this college uh go ahead you you first
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh okay um well the subject we're supposed to be talking about let's see is uh food
 	
 	
 		food
 	
 	
 		what type of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> do do you <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cook</ENAMEX> and what would you uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cook</ENAMEX> in uh uh let's see if you were giving a dinner <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> and the only reason why i may know a little bit about this is that i'm planning on having a barbecue pretty soon and to me that's the type of thing that i like to
 	
 	
 		oh great
 	
 	
 		give in um uh cooking for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and uh if he's cooking outside where it's cooler and uh you don't have to do all that much work you know you just uh slap on some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> and slap on some barbecue <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sauce</ENAMEX>  and away you go
 	
 	
 		yeah we have them too and i i'm trying to think which is the best uh that i prefer uh my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		doesn't like to have all that work on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the very day</TIMEX> that you're doing it uh and we haven't catered out very much uh we would i always worry about the barbecue in that you have to be the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> always gets that chore and you have to make it perfect uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i've made shish kabob which i like it's fairly easy and fast
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh where i guess i'm thinking of the easy thing to do
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		for for having uh
 		uh a dinner
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i do cook but not i'm mostly the easy cooker you know the breakfasts and and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steaks</ENAMEX> uh although i would like to experiment with uh
 	
 	
 		yes
 		
 
 	
 	
 		the meals my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> made you know so to speak and i haven't gotten around to that yet uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		what kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meals</ENAMEX> did she make that you liked
 	
 	
 		well she was <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Polish</ENAMEX> and uh
 		she would make very economical  meals we were very poor different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ham</ENAMEX> and things that uh she would throw things together
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and galunkies and all that and uh i would like to try that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX> and she would make
 		spaghetti with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pork chops</ENAMEX> and and special meat balls and everything and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> of course thinks i'm crazy which i may be too but uh
 	
 	
 		huh
 		no
 		sounds interesting uh-huh yeah that's great
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		but dinner <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> are a lot of work uh
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah but uh that's that's why i like the the outdoor stuff a a lot better <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> can entertain themselves i think a great deal
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		more uh when you have a barbecue especially when you have hot <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hamburgers</ENAMEX> and uh you know nothing really fancy like your your shish kebabs where you have to do a whole bunch of work
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah well that that shish kabob is uh
 		just because it only takes <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a few minutes</TIMEX> to cook you know you get it ready you have to do a lot of work beforehand i agree and buy special stuff but uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so far as getting out there and and putting it on it only takes a little <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a few minutes</TIMEX> uh but anyway i'm i'm thinking of the easy way rather than my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guests</ENAMEX> i guess but uh
 	
 	
 		right
 		
 
 		yeah yeah well i i think you do do a lot of work even if <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> do bring over things you still do uh all the uh housework and get everything everything prepared and utensils and just just everything
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh but you know my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> used to make an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Armenian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice dish</ENAMEX> i'm thinking about uh special dishes and uh yeah it was made out of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX> and consume soup uh and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacon</ENAMEX> and onions
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh yeah</ENAMEX>
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and then you'd simmer it like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all day</TIMEX> long
 	
 	
 		right you'd get the odor of it yeah
 	
 	
 		oh it would because
 		yeah and it was just it was just wonderful that's that's something that i would really like to uh to try and find the recipe for but we used to have that at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thanksgiving</TIMEX> time
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yes
 	
 	
 		because you can you can put it on top of the stove and do this and and there's so much <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">broth</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">juice</ENAMEX> in there that it has to uh soak up into the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all day</TIMEX> long in order for it to uh uh to come out fluffy and and nice
 	
 	
 		oh great
 	
 	
 		and that was you know when you were talking about the the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Polish</ENAMEX> dishes uh some goulashes and things like that that's uh that's what i thought about was that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Armenian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice dish</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh yes we probably ought to try this but it probably will never taste as good as we remembered i guess it gets better and better as we remember it back as we get older you know but we probably should try it uh to do that
 	
 	
 		that's true
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		the recipes are really interesting you know we're probably going to lose them we'll probably forget all about them you know since we're trying to make everything so simple here i am talk about trying to make everything easy you know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		right right
 	
 	
 		i uh you talked about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thanksgiving</TIMEX> there are interesting meals at different times uh something see my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>'s from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> so uh remember we were first married and we were living in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Jersey</ENAMEX> and uh we were going over to my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> for
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> you know to have a meal and we were on the way over we were just married that very year and she said oh i'm looking forward to a nice <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">turkey i said turkey</ENAMEX> i said we don't have <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">turkey</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX>  i said we only have <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">turkey</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thanksgiving</TIMEX> i said we're going to have a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ham</ENAMEX> she said what
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 		oh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh yeah</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i said yeah i said no <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">turkey</ENAMEX> is only for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thanksgiving</TIMEX> and because she had turkey a lot you know and uh that was surprising in the in the east uh we always had <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ham</ENAMEX> you know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		right right
 	
 	
 		and and and that's one thing also that's another recipe i guess we could talk about
 		now the hams just kind of you know go take it out of a can or or uh a package sliced uh the cans were cooked for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours and hours</TIMEX> and and were just wonderful you know i i'd like to try that too
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah you know what i found was at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam</ENAMEX>'s uh wholesale uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> and uh what they have is this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">honey baked ham</ENAMEX> that have you seen have you had any of those
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh yeah i saw them that's good
 		no i i uh i i've i know about  but i think goes
 	
 	
 		if if you ever get a chance to buy one of those i think it was uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty</TIMEX> dollars for uh i don't remember how many pounds it was but you cook it in the bag that they send it in and all the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">juices</ENAMEX> and everything are all sealed in and i tell you what if
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		it's never failed to come out tender and juicy and just and just delicious because i normally don't like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ham</ENAMEX> because it's so salty
 	
 	
 		oh i haven't heard of that yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but with this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">honey bake</ENAMEX> that they have that that's the only one i have been able to find there at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">warehouse</ENAMEX> it is absolutely delicious and it slices great um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i'll have to ask her about that
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> because we have a delivery <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> that comes around that sells i can't think of his name of it uh
 		i don't know i see a can here or a box here <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Gourmet Choice</ENAMEX> uh he delivers uh what is the name of this thing
 		i got a box where is it distributed marsh  it doesn't say
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gourmet Choices</ENAMEX>  but he but it's a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> that has uh you know a truck that comes around and and they recently had hams they have <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steaks</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh actually pierogies and all that stuff that uh
 		i i never i wish i could tell you the name of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> but i don't know what it is but uh they recently had a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ham</ENAMEX> that was supposed to be it was boneless and we tried it it was real nice and it was fully cooked and everything we had it for breakfast a long time it was really great
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		wow you know that sounds like it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but that's that's the only <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ham</ENAMEX> i have found that i thoroughly thoroughly enjoy
 	
 	
 		i would like to try the old recipe though of cooking it and and i keep saying this uh
 		to to do the different things that we did but i would like to put <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> in the oven you know the old fashioned way and put it in there for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours and hours</TIMEX> and see if because i don't think in in my married life which is uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty six years</TIMEX> now
 		we've never done that you know and i remember that when i was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX> uh to have the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ham</ENAMEX> cooking uh rather than that we just <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ham</ENAMEX> is just something you have for breakfast occasionally you know and that's it you know
 	
 	
 		wow
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		right
 		
 
 	
 	
 		in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the old days</TIMEX> we had hams were the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meal</ENAMEX> and i don't i don't think we really have it as a main meal
 	
 	
 		right
 		that's true i i don't think so anymore not with more becoming more conscious of uh fat and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> and and all those good things
 	
 	
 		right yeah that's an interesting point how how have you changed your your meals now have you into that uh looking at those things
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh yeah well my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> actually started it and uh getting
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> that's unusual
 	
 	
 		well it it's true i think my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> are very unusual because uh we grew up in the south where uh you have all the um
 		you know <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">biscuits</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gravy</ENAMEX> and oh fried foods galore and then gradually they started switching over to um plain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX> um
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		no <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gravy</ENAMEX> it's just it really is they uh they're actually they actually uh uh led us through it versus um
 	
 	
 		that's amazing
 	
 	
 		us teaching them you know the uh the finer points but my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> has really high <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> so it was one of the reasons which started them off and they started doing this like in the early or in about the middle seventies uh yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well that's amazing they'd go that they have started usually it's the younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> doing it yeah
 	
 	
 		it's true it's true i agree with you so it's really neat
 	
 	
 		i uh my my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> is the only grandparent left and uh she has high cholesterol of course i have i have too but not like hers
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i always get after her about <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX> and everything else and she just will i mean she's going to eat the same way she ate you know her whole life and she just tells more or less tells me to shut up you know
 	
 	
 		that's right
 		right
 	
 	
 		and uh i like to i'm trying to do something about my <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> in the same way uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh it's it's not the  i listen to uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry Newarth</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the weekend</TIMEX> he's a fitness <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX> and uh he talks about you know the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chicken</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX> and everything else and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh throwing away <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peanut butter</ENAMEX> and all the things things not to eat you know ever i think the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peanut butter</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mayonnaise</ENAMEX> he would throw away forever and then he's got me into making <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX> without the yolk
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">wow um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know try that sometime my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> says she can't stand it but uh when i make scrambled <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX> now talking about a recipe
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i say if i have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX> not not for me but if i'm making <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX> uh even for my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> and i i'll take out all the yolks but one
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		and it's fine you you don't miss it uh in fact when i when i make <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX> for myself
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		if i if i fry them throw them in there i will
 		almost hard fry them
 		so i can take not eat the yolk at all
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and you don't really miss it you get the flavor of the yolk
 		but uh you don't eat it at all you know you don't or hardly you get like uh a bite at at the the most
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and so uh for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> i mean i'm trying that and it has worked my cholesterol gone down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twenty</NUMEX> points uh although

 		i haven't gotten on the which whether was it <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">butter</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> not cholesterol <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">margarine</ENAMEX> and all that i don't know know whether any of that is true you know whether the margarines are butter
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
