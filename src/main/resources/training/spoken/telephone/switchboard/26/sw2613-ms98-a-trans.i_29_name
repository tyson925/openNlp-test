 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so what do you think about it
 	
 	
 		well
 		uh i've noticed some changes over the past uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty years</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		um for the worst i would assume
 	
 	
 		that
 		that it's gotten worse
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i can remember uh back in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early sixties</TIMEX> when i <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> started flying a light <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX>
 		it was quite common for me to take off from uh local <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX> here and see the uh <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Appalachian mountains</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chesapeake Bay</ENAMEX> at the same time
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and in the you know fifteen <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years later</TIMEX> it was a rare occasion that i could see both at the same time
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		you're probably lucky to see the end of the runway by now
 	
 	
 		yeah i know uh lot of times when i was coming back home i would uh file instrument flight plan just to get into the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> area
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		but i counted on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Carolina</ENAMEX> having some good weather for me
 	
 	
 		well i'll tell you i don't know i i don't know whether i i i count the stink as part of air pollution and it stinks down here
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well down there you get uh uh some more aromatic aromas like the uh the smell of the pine forest and uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		it depends on where you are now if you're over
 	
 	
 		then you get down wind of a paper <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mill</ENAMEX> once in a while
 	
 	
 		yeah if you if you're over by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Asheville</ENAMEX> you're pretty good because you're up there in the mountains and you've got some nice <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ozone</ENAMEX> and all that
 		over here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Raleigh</ENAMEX> it's kind of flat and stagnant and
 		just yucky
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		it's fine over on the coast because you've got the you've got the breezes off the off the water there
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh seems like it's just dull and uninspiring here
 	
 	
 		well i'm not sure that we're going to be able to uh solve much of the problem
 	
 	
 		no i don't know they're they keep doing things and it doesn't seem to be doing any good
 		i was i was really amazed because i never would have expected you know this problem somewhere like in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Atlanta</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i drove through <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Atlanta</ENAMEX> uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">couple of weeks ago</TIMEX> and it was unseasonably warm
 		and you could see the smog just sitting on top of the city
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and when i drove through i it it was terrible i i had to keep the windows up
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it was just so thick and uh
 		heavy
 		uh i couldn't believe it i because i mean i used to live in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Atlanta</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX> and it was always fairly clean i mean you you always you didn't have problem with stagnant air like like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LA</ENAMEX> does
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> it was really bad that day
 		and it
 	
 	
 		well one of the reactions i have is that uh they put so much emphasis on the private automobile
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> as being a major source of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pollution</ENAMEX> and they've uh ignored the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trucks</ENAMEX> entirely
 	
 	
 		yeah right
 	
 	
 		so i i get to going down the expressway in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX> and uh i don't see very many <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> smoking
 	
 	
 		but you see all these all these <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trucks</ENAMEX> belching out this black smoke
 	
 	
 		but
 		then i i get surrounded by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty</TIMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">forty trucks</ENAMEX> and they're just laying out a pall of black smoke
 	
 	
 		yeah i know it's
 		i i i i don't understand where the priority is it's uh like in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Atlanta</ENAMEX> they have um they have mandatory catalytic converter inspections
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		there's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only three</NUMEX> places in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Georgia</ENAMEX> that requires that
 		and uh even with that it hasn't done any good
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i mean obviously it's gotten a lot worse
 		but you know just like you say you go through there and you watch all these <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trucks</ENAMEX> and they're just coughing out all kinds of stuff some of them spitting it out so thick you can't even see past it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know i don't know
 	
 	
 		yeah i know along route <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixty six</TIMEX> the uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who have <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residences</ENAMEX> there
 		uh they can't paint their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> without cleaning them first
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah because of the stuff settles on it
 	
 	
 		uh
 		if they're within a block of a major expressway the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> get coated with oil
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		
 
 		i don't know things like you know well like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid rain</ENAMEX> and all these sulphur dioxides being dumped out there
 		i i'm more worried about that than i am just about anything else
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		because uh
 		uh it's it's all i mean it's just like it's just like a big avalanche you know you start putting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulphur dioxide</ENAMEX> in the atmosphere and you end up with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid rain acid rain</ENAMEX> kills
 		the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees trees</ENAMEX> don't scrub the air and there you are
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and then of course you've got all these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX> cutting down on the rain forest as quick as they can
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm not sure that we're not seeing some of the effects of that already
 	
 	
 		i wonder too you know they keep talking about ozone depletion and all this
 		it it seems funny that it's coming around at the time when we're losing the most most of the forests
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		because i i i think that a lot of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pollutants</ENAMEX> and stuff are being taken out of the air
 		uh
 		you know by the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> and all that good stuff and here we are losing it and now the now it doesn't have any where to go
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but ozone
 	
 	
 		well we've sort of been seeing a little climatic shift here on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Coast</ENAMEX> or at least it seems that way that uh the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winters</TIMEX> have been milder for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last five years</TIMEX> and uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah well it's like our <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> here i mean it was the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> that wasn't you know we were having having hot days in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and got in
 	
 	
 		yeah <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first the first winter</TIMEX> i moved out here i had a big snow plow on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">tractor</ENAMEX> and i had to use it we had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fourteen</NUMEX> inch uh snows
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i haven't used it since
 	
 	
 		yeah you might you might as well sell it for scrap or something because you probably never will use it
 		it's a shame too because i miss all the cold weather i i enjoy winter
 	
 	
 		and at the same time i i see some colder <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winters</TIMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Midwest</ENAMEX> i think they've gotten more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">snow</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past five years</TIMEX> than we're having here on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Coast</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah well it was an interesting day <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the other day</TIMEX> uh i think it was um yeah it was last not not <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this past Friday</TIMEX> but <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday a week</TIMEX> ago
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		we had i don't know i think you had some bad weather up there too we had tornadoes and everything down here
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um that was the most historic weather day in recorded history for severe weather in the country
 	
 	
 		oh i didn't know that
 	
 	
 		on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that one day</TIMEX> i mean you know of course you always have severe weather somewhere
 		but there was more of it on that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX> than ever recorded before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">over four hundred</TIMEX> reports of tornadoes hail and heavy winds
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		amazing
 		it's a little bit scary
 	
 	
 		well it may have been uh the fact we had this early <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX> warm spell
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that did that because i know that the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the preceding the preceding day Thursday</TIMEX> i got my first sunburn for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the season</TIMEX> out on uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ocean City Beach</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um
 		i read an article <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple weeks ago</TIMEX> they were talking about uh talking again about the ozone layer they said that the uh
 		the ozone deteriorate is greater than they had originally thought over some of the major metropolitan areas that's a little bit scary to think about
 		because that's certainly not going to improve things around there
 	
 	
 		yes
 		i didn't notice that uh know that they'd discovered any thinness or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX> metro metro areas i'd only heard about the uh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North and South Pole</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well that's that's yeah that had that had been the thing that had always i mean i i i have always thought about the ozone layer as sort of like a layer and it would move around i didn't know that the hole just stayed there
 		you know i guess i i don't i'm not that much of a meteorologist
 		but uh yeah i was a little surprised at that too because up to that point all i'd heard about was the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> over the pole
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i said well i'm not too awfully concerned about that if it's going to start melting the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">ice cap</ENAMEX> it's not going to be for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a long time</TIMEX> yet
 		but opening opening up over major metropolitan areas now that's uh that's
 	
 	
 		yeah that that doesn't uh fit my picture of uh of uh meteorology i can understand the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Poles</ENAMEX> because they're uh a permanent high pressure area
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh you know there isn't that much uh circulation
 		but uh the temperate <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">zone</ENAMEX> is uh a constant moving uh wind system
 	
 	
 		yeah course the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ozone</ENAMEX> is up there so
 	
 	
 		and it's i'm surprised that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ozone</ENAMEX> doesn't have it's own wind pattern
 	
 	
 		yeah i i mean didn't i don't even know i don't even know if the ozone layer does move i mean apparently it doesn't but
 		of course it it might be just a couple of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientists</ENAMEX> trying to get their name in the paper sort of like cold fusion
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		cold fusion right
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		the same thought flashed in my mind
 	
 	
 		yeah i'll tell you i i was real excited when i first heard that i said hot dog they finally did it you know
 	
 	
 		yeah i uh
 		i may have put out an exclamation here at home when i heard that news
 	
 	
 		um i too
 	
 	
 		and uh everybody wanted to know why i was so excited and i tried to explain to them
 	
 	
 		i mean i'm
 		yeah i mean i'm an old science fiction buff from way back when i was a little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> and this is the kind of stuff that science fiction was made out of
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and it's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the days</TIMEX> that i keep looking for that aren't going to happen in my lifetime
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but
 		you know we're supposed to have moon <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> by now
 		but uh yeah cold fusion would have been great
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		could have gone might have started making a little inroads on air pollution with that
 	
 	
 		i think so
 	
 	
 		but who knows
 	
 	
 		except we might have uh bad case of paladium poisoning now
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah there's there's always a drawback to everything i mean
 		i don't know
 		well
 	
 	
 		i know there was uh a pipeline going in up in uh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">southern Pennsylvania</ENAMEX>
 		and there was a group
 		in uh Bucks <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">county</ENAMEX> that was fighting it
 		and uh one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> that was leading the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> said well they say they're going to pump <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">uh oil</ENAMEX> through there but before long they'll be pumping radioactivity through it
 	
 	
 		okay
