 
     		
 	
 		okay the i guess the latest one that we've seen is uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Awakening</ENAMEX> with uh yeah that's with uh uh
 	
 	
 		Awakening
 		i haven't heard of that one
 	
 	
 		oh the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> that plays <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark uh Robin Williams</ENAMEX> and he played a terrific part in that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		huh
 	
 	
 		but uh that's one of the better ones we've seen in in the last oh i guess <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last six months</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah we just saw uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Flatliners</ENAMEX> last night that was really good
 	
 	
 		Flatliners i want i never did get to see that
 	
 	
 		oh that's a good movie
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		this uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Awakening i</ENAMEX> think is is something along the same lines
 	
 	
 		it's got some
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's uh about a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> uh and it's a true story
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh there was a bunch of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that were uh they first of all they they  thought they had <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Parkinson Parkinson's disease</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		they would tremble first start trembling real bad but then they would just go almost go into a coma
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		they they could tell that they were responding that they could hear you
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but it was just a blank stare you got and they were just almost frozen
 		in in in a position
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		and they tried some uh
 		tried some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> and then all of a sudden that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one summer</TIMEX> uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> that they gave them brought them out of their coma and that's where they got the word awakening
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but then they lapsed back into the coma
 		but uh
 		and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert DeNiro</ENAMEX> played the uh played i guess uh the co-lead part he was one of the ones that were in a coma
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		when did this movie come out
 	
 	
 		oh it's been out i guess now for
 		or a month and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a half</NUMEX> or something like that
 	
 	
 		huh i haven't heard about that one
 	
 	
 		but if you get a chance see that i also want to see uh that uh <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Sleeping With The Enemy or Silence of the Lambs</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh that's a great a movie yeah we went to see that
 	
 	
 		i've heard that that's good
 	
 	
 		oh that's awesome
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah if you don't  you don't mind the the gross parts of it
 	
 	
 		yeah well i heard it's not really that that uh gross it's not like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday the 13th</TIMEX> or something like that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh yeah
 		just the subtle kind of stuff though
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		it uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Flatliners</ENAMEX> is a real good movie too i recommend renting that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's got some uh interesting things about it because you know you know what the plot is basically that they kill themselves and come back
 	
 	
 		yeah but they they're trying to experience uh life after death
 	
 	
 		yeah then when they come back all sorts of strange things start happening to them
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		we don't see as many movies as we used to
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>

 		oh yeah i liked that one that was good
 	
 	
 		uh
 		but it
 		uh it's not typical <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robin Williams</ENAMEX> i you know i expected some comedy or something like that but he he's a good dramatic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actor actor</ENAMEX> when he wants to be
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		um yep
 		so what other movies have you rented recently

 		uh-huh  yeah  as always
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		well
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		i was trying to think of something else i i do miss uh i'm i'm fifty <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven years old</TIMEX> and you don't sound like you're that old
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		no
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twenty two</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		but uh i remember when i was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid kid</ENAMEX> and you'd go to the movies and you got to see a movie and usually a double feature
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you got to see a newsreel
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and usually a serial like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Flash Gordon</ENAMEX> or or uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zorro</ENAMEX> or something like that line
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and then a cartoon
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> cartoon sometimes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> cartoons
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and you could spend almost all <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> at the movie just watching movies and
 		other stuff but now it it's the movie and the previews and that's about it
 	
 	
 		and the ads
 	
 	
 		and the ads
 	
 	
 		throw a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coke</ENAMEX> ad in there
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		but a lot of times we would go to the movies just to see the cartoons and the serial
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		because you always wondered
 		how can the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> get out of this
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and then the next yeah cliffhangers and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next week</TIMEX> you'd find out how he got out of it
 	
 	
 		cliffhanger
 		and into something else
 	
 	
 		yeah
