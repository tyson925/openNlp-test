 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about two years</TIMEX> now how long will it be before you're ready to buy another one
 	
 	
 		oh probably <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">another year another year or so</TIMEX> i'm i'm working in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Waco</ENAMEX> and so i probably won't buy another one until i get another job
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 		i see well
 	
 	
 		so but this one i mean i like this one a lot um if i were to get a new car i it may be a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> a another uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nissan</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah that's you uh you like driving that uh that particular brand of foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> huh yeah yeah we we drive uh <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> right now our our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> drives a uh
 	
 	
 		something
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toyota</ENAMEX> but we both drive my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> drives a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cadillac</ENAMEX> and i drive a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chevrolet</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		right
 		i've always heard that the foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> are are the you know foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toyota</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> they have good mileage it's better and they last and last my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> has a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toyota</ENAMEX> and she's she's going on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about a hundred and fifty thousand</NUMEX> miles
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		on it and it's still trucking so i  she's sticking with it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um i think i probably want uh a kind of a sportier car the one i have now is gray and i like black
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and probably like tinted windows and a nice stereo system tape player i don't have a tape <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">player</ENAMEX> in mine which is really killing me
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh yeah yeah that that makes a makes it a little different i i i would i thought it would make a difference when i got my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> it has a tape <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">player</ENAMEX> in it but i don't use it a lot
 	
 	
 		uh yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but i do listen to the radio all the time i like having that stereo radio with the it's got the equalizer in it
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 		right the problem with that in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Waco</ENAMEX> is there's not many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stations</ENAMEX> and so you pretty much depend on tapes  and CDs etcetera and so on because there's not a whole lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stations</ENAMEX> to listen to um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		do you do a lot of driving or just just
 	
 	
 		what
 		pretty much yeah i not in my own personal <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> i drive a lot in my uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> car
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um my personal <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> i usually just drive to work and back or to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mall</ENAMEX> or something but not a whole lot i do drive back and forth to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> a lot in that car
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		well our
 	
 	
 		and that's probably wearing it down quite a bit
 	
 	
 		i guess we could say my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> is the family <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> and we don't you know she drives it to and from work it's about it's you know what the most of its driving is my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> is my business car and i drive quite a bit you know in my for my business role
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		right
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		if you were to get another kind of car what would it be
 	
 	
 		well i probably will stick with an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> car <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> made <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> i i like the size you know the little bit larger car
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh we do tend to travel a bit and it's we just enjoy the you know the ride better for for longer trips
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 	
 	
 		and uh so
 	
 	
 		i do tend to like riding in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> i've just never had one so i i can't really compare
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		so yeah i've had i haven't had a a foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> myself you know for my own personal personal use in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a long time</TIMEX> i had a little <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Volkswagen</ENAMEX> Beetle <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time
 	
 	
 		right
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		the big problem with a foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> he drove or he always forever and ever he's had <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Audis</ENAMEX> and those <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> and they're so expensive to get fixed
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 		right yeah
 	
 	
 		and that that's a big
 		big uh minus sign  for the foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i have some uh i have some business acquaintances that drive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jaguars</ENAMEX> and uh you know i really like the looks of those but
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		right
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> and i rode in one of them uh not too long ago and it it has a pretty good ride at least riding in the backseat was pretty good you know so
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh so it you know its when i when i move up a little bit in uh in price range that you know that's what i've kind of got my eye on is you know is maybe looking at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of those but
 	
 	
 		yes
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 		i think i've got my eye on a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Maxima</ENAMEX> when my price range  is in reach
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so
 		what do you think about the about all the new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vans</ENAMEX> that are out
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well i i'm not uh really not too interested in a van myself i have seen you know seen them running around town
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh i'm not too crazy about the looks of them and they look like some of them look like they might be dangerous you're so so you'd be sitting right up on the front with a lot of glass
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		right up uh-huh
 		but it it it would seem to me as if i was sitting in a bullet
 	
 	
 		that
 		right
 	
 	
 		of some sort and i'm right in the front you know it's
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah but then you know there's a i think one of them does have a a little more of a front end on it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but then uh then some of them i like the looks of that better you know to have have a little more <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicle</ENAMEX> in front of you between you and the oncoming traffic seems to me it'd be a little safer
 	
 	
 		right
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		right
 		uh
 		i don't know i think i'll probably be hanging on to my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> for a while i guess here
 	
 	
 		yeah so
 		
 
 	
 	
 		move up as i move up
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah have you how how about uh how do the tires last on that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> have you had to put tires on i
 	
 	
 		so
 		i haven't had to put any tires on it and they're they're still they still have tread on them and everything i probably will have to change them here soon but
 	
 	
 		yeah i think that's
 		yeah i think that is one of the things that you find on the foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> is that you know that some of the things that might cost you a little more but they last longer you know tires brakes and things like that might
 	
 	
 		right right
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		might last a little
 	
 	
 		yeah this car i haven't had any problem at all except for uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of weeks ago</TIMEX> the it completely like shut down and it really shouldn't have done this because it's it's relatively new car
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and it completely shut down it wouldn't it just started going it went in drive and just kept driving i would put it in rear it kept going straight so i just drove it to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> place and they said that it looked like i'd bumped something underneath the car
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		and i knew i hadn't bumped anything but i had taken it to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sears</ENAMEX> for an oil change <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of days</TIMEX> before and i'm thinking they did took a screw out or bumped something or something and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah they might have let it let the  the uh lift down with something underneath it
 	
 	
 		exactly that's what i was thinking because i know i haven't done anything to it and so i really haven't had any other problems except for that which i don't think would have been a problem
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah so
 	
 	
 		had i taken it somewhere else or something
 	
 	
 		well it sounds like you you you it sounds like you've got your plans all made though anyway to stick
 	
 	
 		but yeah i haven't had any problems at all
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		stick with that car
 	
 	
 		yes yep
 	
 	
 		well it's been uh been interesting interesting talking to you and uh well okay thanks uh-huh bye-bye
 	
 	
 		oh yeah it's been good talking to you too okay thank you bye-bye
