 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		um do you have a favorite credit card that you use
 	
 	
 		um i probably use my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Discover</ENAMEX> card more than anything else
 	
 	
 		because any particular reason
 	
 	
 		uh no i really don't use too many credit cards i'm not fond of them i don't like using them
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but i've just gotten to the point where i'd rather carry that instead of cash
 	
 	
 		yeah i know what you mean
 	
 	
 		but but the thing is i always carry it with my checkbook so if i have i just pay for it with my check instead of
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i think i've only ever used my credit card maybe <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three or four</NUMEX> times
 	
 	
 		oh really wow
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		well i use um a credit card that's given out by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US Air</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		well not given out i mean there's an annual fee um and the neat thing about the credit card is for every dollar that you charge you get one frequent flyer mile
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and um  my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> and i tend to charge a lot
 		and even things that we wouldn't normally charge now we charge because we've racked up seriously close in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past couple of years</TIMEX> close to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">five or six thousand dollars</NUMEX> just by charging
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		wow
 	
 	
 		and um it's really great because you can get some good discounts um on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US Air</ENAMEX> you know using frequent flyer mileage and all that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">um</ENAMEX> and the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> fee isn't bad i think it's maybe <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty five</TIMEX> dollars a year
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">um</ENAMEX> and here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rochester</ENAMEX> maybe in in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> also but you can charge your groceries
 	
 	
 		yeah uh-huh yeah
 	
 	
 		can you do that there
 		which is great
 	
 	
 		with only only certain certain cards they accept though they don't accept all kinds of cards like they only accept the major cards
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh do do they accept <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Discover</ENAMEX> or no
 	
 	
 		um i don't know they do accept the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Discover</ENAMEX> but i know they would accept like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Visa</ENAMEX> Master Card
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		well i love it and now um actually our our mortgage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> is starting i think <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June</TIMEX> first or something is going to start allowing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to charge their mortgage
 	
 	
 		oh my
 	
 	
 		and that's going to be great
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">um</ENAMEX> and in the beginning we were having a problem because we would charge everything and then get this enormous bill
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and just be totally wiped out because one thing i hate is paying interest
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i refuse to pay interest if i'm going to do that i'm not going to use a credit card
 	
 	
 		exactly
 		exactly
 	
 	
 		so what i do now is i i work it like a checkbook and every time i charge something i write it rout i write it out
 		so i'm not fooling myself into thinking i have that money
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know i write it out and then it's it's as if i paid in cash
 	
 	
 		exactly yeah
 	
 	
 		so you're somebody that will pay off your bills right away
 	
 	
 		uh yes yes definitely that see that if if i don't have the money in my checking account i will not charge it even if i have the charge
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i have to have that money before i'll charge it
 	
 	
 		um-hum yep i know what you mean
 	
 	
 		i refuse well i'm a college <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> and i'm a finance major
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so  and um i don't i oh my gosh i probably i have a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Discover</ENAMEX> card
 	
 	
 		well that makes sense
 	
 	
 		i have an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX> card but i don't use it because i don't even know where it is i put it away like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years ago</TIMEX> because i thought if i don't see it i won't use it which is really good because then
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right
 	
 	
 		i you know a lot of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> have like outrageous phone bills but i don't have it because i don't use mine
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and um i know i have <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Montgomery Ward</ENAMEX>'s i have a um a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">J C Penney</ENAMEX>'s i have a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kaufman</ENAMEX>'s you know i have a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Fashion Bug i</ENAMEX> have a whole bunch of them
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i just used my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">J C</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Penney</ENAMEX> card and it's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year old</TIMEX> and that was the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time i've ever used it
 	
 	
 		really well
 	
 	
 		yeah i just i don't think to use them all the time and if i do use one i would rather use my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Discover</ENAMEX> card one
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and they're getting to the point now too at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the year</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		all the money that you've you've charged on they'll pay you i think it's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> percent back
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		a discount yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		so you know i even got a couple dollars back
 	
 	
 		seem
 		um-hum it's definitely worth if you pay off your bills in full then credit cards are a real good idea
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		because you don't have to carry a whole lot of cash and you get the interest you know if you charge at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the beginning of the month</TIMEX> then you're getting a month's worth of interest
 	
 	
 		exactly
 	
 	
 		in your account
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um but the second you let it go even <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one month</TIMEX> um they had made an error on our statement where they never posted the payment yet i had the canceled check i had everything
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and um i mean for that amount it was like a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> dollar interest charge
 	
 	
 		oh my gosh
 	
 	
 		that's like another purchase for me it buying something
 	
 	
 		yeah me too  that would definitely be for me too um-hum
 	
 	
 		yeah but um you know one thing one of the reasons because i have some of those cards that you mentioned and i think about it and a lot of reason i have those cards because <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">J C</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Penney</ENAMEX> offered you know a free gift if you buy it
 	
 	
 		uh that's why i have it
 	
 	
 		yeah or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">five dollars</NUMEX> off this purchase if you you know sign up and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh as long as it because i don't <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">J C Penney</ENAMEX> doesn't cost you anything i don't think
 	
 	
 		no huh-uh no
 	
 	
 		right and so as long as it doesn't cost you anything then
 	
 	
 		that that yeah and being a college <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> i get um
 		applications for them all the time i think once a week i have an application and the first thing i check for is if there's an annual fee if there's an annual fee i ditch it because i don't use them that often so it wouldn't even pay me to get it even if it was you know
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Discover</ENAMEX> card i have no <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> fee and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mom</ENAMEX> like i started using <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mine</ENAMEX> and i told my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mom</ENAMEX> about it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and now she buys everything with her <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Discover Discover</ENAMEX> card and she works it the way you do with your card she writes it down like she would a check and then you know that way she's getting the interest on it too because at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the year</TIMEX> they give her back her interest
 	
 	
 		um-hum oh yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		oh right
 	
 	
 		and i think she got back like fifty some dollars last year
 	
 	
 		uh wow that is great
 	
 	
 		so i mean she might spend <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three thousand</NUMEX> but if you get <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> of it back you know that's still <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> dollars less
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 		right and that's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> dollars that you didn't pay any money to have it in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> place
 	
 	
 		exactly and she you know my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mom</ENAMEX>'s like that too she pays it off as soon as the bill comes
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		one thing i still don't understand about credit cards is
 		is how you can borrow money off a credit card i still haven't quite figured that out
 	
 	
 		i haven't tried it i don't trust it
 	
 	
 		i know i don't trust it either and um i know you can do it with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Visa</ENAMEX> card but it just seems like too simple and i know that there's some hidden
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		there's so there's so much fine print that i don't understand that i won't even try it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah i just rely on my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mac</ENAMEX> card
 	
 	
 		on your what
 	
 	
 		my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mac</ENAMEX> card just take it out of the bank
 	
 	
 		oh just yeah the machine
 		one thing that um that does scare me a little bit about my credit card is when i am giving it over the phone
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		or you know if i i i tend to buy a lot of things from TV like not not the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shopper</ENAMEX>'s thing but sometimes they'll be something good that they're selling a record or something like that and um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and after i do it i think God who did i give my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">number</ENAMEX> to
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and um you know what are they going to do with it how can i trust them or whatever
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but um the credit card <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> i did have a charge on there once that i had no receipt for i had no recollection i didn't even know the the store
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and they took it right off no questions i just said this isn't my charge if you can prove that it is then great if you can't then um you know just take it off
 	
 	
 		okay
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah they're usually i think they're usually pretty good about that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh i mean they they probably realized it was their mistake if if they really thought that it was not their mistake i think they would probably send you something proving that you actually did have it so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh yeah
 		yeah they would pursue it definitely
 	
 	
 		yeah uh-huh i i'm i'm starting to use my credit card more like i said i'm a college <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past two semesters</TIMEX> i bought my books with it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		so and i run <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between two and three hundred dollars</NUMEX> a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">semester</TIMEX> with books
 	
 	
 		um-hum um yeah
 	
 	
 		so that's <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">approximately between five and six hundred dollars</NUMEX> that i put on it and i just keep thinking oh good i'm going to get that back i'm going to get a little bit back  uh-huh
 	
 	
 		right
 		right yeah that's true before you could at least deduct if you did pay any interest you could at least deduct that from your taxes
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but now you can't do it and i know <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that have racked up
 		they they keep getting their limit extended because they keep exceeding it
 	
 	
 		i
 		i can't see that
 	
 	
 		and then and all they can do is is pay the minimum balance or not that you know
 	
 	
 		and when they do that all they're doing is paying the interest on it they're not even paying the principal
 	
 	
 		exactly oh
 		nope they're not even touching it
 	
 	
 		i i uh when when i get to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> like that i wish i think the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> should just say uh we're not giving you any more until you pay this off
 	
 	
 		i know
 	
 	
 		it don't i realize that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> wants you to use it you know and extend it all the time they're making more money off you
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but i think they should have the the consumer the most interest you know
 	
 	
 		yeah it's true though because then all they end up doing is spending more of their time making collection calls
 	
 	
 		it's like they're addicted to using their credit card or something
 	
 	
 		oh yeah some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are they really are i mean if they have if they know they have more more on their limit
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		that i i might i think my brother-in-law is like that actually but um he if he has a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">hundred dollars</NUMEX> left until he reaches his limit he'll spend it
 	
 	
 		oh my God
 	
 	
 		he can't because to him it's like money to him it's like a a loan almost in a sense and he can't bear to
 	
 	
 		i can't i can't do that
 	
 	
 		no i can't either
 	
 	
 		i have like i said i have to i have to know that i have that money before i'll spend it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so i i i don't
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i don't know  of course my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mom</ENAMEX> lives very she was she had twelve <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> and of course she she watched her money all the time and i that was one good thing i did get off of her
 	
 	
 		i know
 		oh my God
 	
 	
 		uh i don't mind spending my money as long as it's a necessity
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and if it's something i really really want but just to go out and start buying i'm not like that and that's something i got off of her and i'm
 	
 	
 		yeah
