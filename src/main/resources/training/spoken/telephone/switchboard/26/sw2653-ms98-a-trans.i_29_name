 
     		
 	
 		so i own uh a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCAT</ENAMEX> at my home
 	
 	
 		uh-huh i could never justify owning a personal computer at at home
 		uh i mean that's quite an expense to look
 		for uh well well well who is this what do you do use yours at home for
 	
 	
 		well that's actually a good question my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> works out of the home uh our home she has an office and it sits actually sits in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> and she uses it to compose and print out letters
 	
 	
 		okay well now
 	
 	
 		so that's a a very regular use of it that she has
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and then in addition to that i tinker around with it i'm a computer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientist</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and so i write programs to do little things i'm actually working on a data base at home just just to keep track of things nothing special and also
 		i'm interested in writing some programs that will you know kind of like remind me of things uh like remind me that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wednesdays</ENAMEX> is trash day and the like
 		although
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		well
 		excuse me
 		i uh
 		uh well i'm i'm a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">technician</ENAMEX> electronics tech and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> sent me to their uh computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> down in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Austin</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">hum-um</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so uh i learned to repair one but you know i never really learned to operate one
 	
 	
 		oh that's a key thing well actually there's that's a there's really <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> issues to that that there's so many packages software packages available <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> that just require no programming
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		so that you you in other words when someone built that software package they had to use the programming but if they were careful they could uh make the use of it totally without understanding how the computer works
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but i think you you you really hit the nail on the head for the average <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> is exactly what he can use it for and if your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> isn't working out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> and sending out letters or if you don't
 		want to build a data base to keep track of the nuts and bolts in your <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garage</ENAMEX> or whatever there your issue is then there really is
 	
 	
 		well uh space is a handicap with me i live in a motor home
 	
 	
 		oh i see wow
 	
 	
 		and i'm preparing for retirement
 	
 	
 		i see well congratulations on that
 	
 	
 		hey i'm not too far from it <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">another year</TIMEX> and a half
 	
 	
 		yeah well actually uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> other thing i might ought to mention is that they are actually getting quite cheap that
 	
 	
 		yes definitely the just like the computers
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh remember how they started out running <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">four hundred dollars</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		right oh the calculators you mean
 	
 	
 		now
 		i mean calculators calculators i beg your pardon yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah uh-huh
 		yeah they sure do
 		yeah i actually was thinking about upgrading mine very recently and kind of look at the whole spectrum you can actually buy a whole a whole brand new computer with a not not a uh necessarily a slow one or or inadequate <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> but a pretty good one
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">six hundred dollars</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		you're kidding including a printer
 	
 	
 		no hm that
 		well actually actually i wasn't including a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">printer</ENAMEX> but you you can buy a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">printer</ENAMEX> now for a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">hundred dollars</NUMEX> so make it <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">seven hundred</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundred</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		wholly smoke uh a respectable one
 	
 	
 		yes uh-huh um-hum
 	
 	
 		well see of not being particularly interested i don't keep track of prices on them but i'm i'm that does amaze amaze me
 	
 	
 		yeah the prices have plummeted you can buy the computer the guts just the guts with the power supply the box and the mother <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> of a a type of computer called an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8088</TIMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about two hundred dollars</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		hum
 	
 	
 		and then the keyboard is another fifty the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">monitor</ENAMEX> with the card that drives it is another <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundred</NUMEX> and then the disk drive is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> fifty and
 	
 	
 		well what what is a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a</NUMEX> a good brand a for inexpensive
 	
 	
 		well that's the that's the deal is you're not buying brands now you're buying these knock offs so there's uh probably the way to do it if you really wanted to buy one there's there's a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Computer Shopper</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">huh huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it's a it's a big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> i mean it's it's <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">twelve inches</NUMEX> across uh narrow the narrow side and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">and fifteen fifteen seventeen inches the</NUMEX> tall side and it's probably <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">an inch</NUMEX> thick <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a thousand</NUMEX> pages but the book is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> is full
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		of these mail order computer mail order <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> and they're all competing with each so you just flip through there until you find a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8088</TIMEX> computer
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		that's that's called that's the original PC so it's be called a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> PC i'm sorry an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> PC compatible
 		and you'll find all these things and you'll find the monitors for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">forty dollars</NUMEX> and the card that drives the monitor that goes in the back of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board board</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty five</TIMEX> dollars which is amazing to me
 		and just you mix and match and then you do it by mail order
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		but there's no real brands there's probably a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half a dozen</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> around the world that are making those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> boards the main computer the circuit board
 	
 	
 		i see how do you go about getting one of those uh catalogs
 	
 	
 		they're available in you know the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">B Daltons</ENAMEX> that that type of thing
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you'll notice it in that it's it's a it's a very it's although it's a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> it's large and like i said it's <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about an inch</NUMEX> thick
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		well getting back to the PC's i'll tell you i uh <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of all i don't like a machine that's smarter than me
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and secondly i learned did learn this much about computers they're they're they are pretty stupid because they add <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one and one</NUMEX> up and come up with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		in binary
 	
 	
 		that's right
 		that's great
 	
 	
 		well anyway that's one of my favorite jokes about that
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> equals <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah that's great
 	
 	
 		course you it's it's kind of an inside joke you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 		you can only tell that to somebody who understands binary
 	
 	
 		i understand that's great that's a good joke
 	
 	
 		so what do you uh uh work with uh computers uh at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TI</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		well what i did for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> and then i was was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientist</ENAMEX> over in central research <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">labs</ENAMEX> and just recently i've changed my job to actually do some of the marketing
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so i now i i type that one but i don't use it anymore
 	
 	
 		um-hum well i just recently started using one uh connection with my work
 	
 	
 		i don't
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yes
 	
 	
 		uh i keep track of an inventory here and of course now that is where a computer is is very handy
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yes i agree
 	
 	
 		and
 		well
 		i it's my responsibility to see that equipment is sent off to be calibrated
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		uh see i'm with the QRA lab
 	
 	
 		oh i see that's fascinating
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">qualification</ENAMEX> and evaluation so naturally our equipment has to be in in top condition and is constantly calibrated and they're dated
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so i have to keep up with them uh and it's very handy doing it on the computer
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i just run a printout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every week</TIMEX> and and it puts me right up-to-date what i'm what i have to do what i have to ship what i should be expecting to be returned
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so uh it it is handy
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and i must admit that up until i did start using one uh it was
 		i had very little interest in computers
 	
 	
 		yes
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but they are amazing
 	
 	
 		yeah they certainly are so let's see so i guess with respect to the question
 		yeah i i guess we've we've kind of covered it
 	
 	
 		well
 		i think we did
 	
 	
 		great nice little conversation with you <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack</ENAMEX> good <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">good day</TIMEX> thank you good same to you
 	
 	
 		yeah <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike</ENAMEX> you take care now good luck to you
