 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		start
 	
 	
 		what kind of recycling programs do you have in Rowlett
 	
 	
 		um the well right now they've got a kind of a central location off of the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">highway</ENAMEX> and they've got some great big bins there for newspaper
 		um plastic
 		um i think <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> bins for glass white green and whatever whatever other combination there is and and i think they've got a comp uh some kind of container for aluminum
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plano</ENAMEX>'s doing real good on that they have uh they start off putting out great big huge garbage cans
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		which we're supposed to put all our <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week</TIMEX>'s garbage into it and of course it doesn't fit right now but now we start in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX> breaking it down and they're picking it all up
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um
 	
 	
 		so they're going to by and we have to separate our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX> and our <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glass</ENAMEX> and then uh they have <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX> for like um
 		oh everything you picked up from your <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">yard</ENAMEX> and we put that in disposable bags and they pick that up on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		um
 	
 	
 		so it's really great i i'm really going head you know completely for it i think it's marvelous
 	
 	
 		well that's good well <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rowlett</ENAMEX> had sent sent out a survey not too long ago um in terms in how many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> were interested in having a a pick up
 		i guess on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the days</TIMEX> they do trash or something like that And apparently a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> responded to it favorably favorably because they're going to do it i don't know how how soon they're going to do it or
 		how organized it's going to be but they're they're supposed to initiate that some sometime in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next couple of months</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		well does your uh where you work do they also have aluminum cans <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pickups</ENAMEX> and things like that
 	
 	
 		um i've never noticed that we don't have a a whole lot because we're in a hospital setting so most of the things we have are through our cafeteria um
 	
 	
 		well down in the cafeteria do they have any place where you can put your you know pop cans and things like that
 	
 	
 		um no there's there's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> pop machine and it's not accessible to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cafeteria</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">now</TIMEX> so uh mainly what they serve in there is juice and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 		so you don't have much choice there
 	
 	
 		no  not not really
 	
 	
 		well i work at uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JC Penny</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX> they brought they have a sign up that says for one full week
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you bring in your old wire hangers
 		and they are going to recycle them
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		so it's getting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> clean out their closets and such and then like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the week before</TIMEX> that they said go through your cupboards and any <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> that is still good bring it in and they brought it down to the shelters
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and they have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one two</NUMEX> they have
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> i think that i know of for cans for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have pop and they put them right near where they have the time cards and it works great and they have one in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> where the  snack machines are too
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 		that's good
 	
 	
 		so they're really going at it and i think it's marvelous because
 	
 	
 		yeah i i guess <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rowlett</ENAMEX>'s done a lot for the size town it is
 		and i think they're trying to to make some changes i i noticed at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> or someplace <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this past uh month month</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a half ago</TIMEX> they were having a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX> um talk about
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		and i think they're trying to to make some changes i i noticed at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> or someplace <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this past uh month month</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a half ago</TIMEX> they were having a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speaker</ENAMEX> um talk about doing lawn work and how how important it is to to cut your lawn without a bag
 		just kind of mulch it rather than bag it up because of all all the the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">grass</ENAMEX> that's being bagged and being hauled away by the garbage <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trucks</ENAMEX> and stuff
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and it's uh i guess a lot more ecological ecological to just mow the grass
 		and let it work it's way back into the soil
 	
 	
 		well did you watch the program <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the other night</TIMEX> on um was it <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Save America</ENAMEX> it was good
 	
 	
 		i saw part of that
 	
 	
 		the only thing i guess thought um that i haven't been trying is when i you know go to take a shower to save the water and to put it on my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> which i had never thought about before
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but i've already gone to oh i started <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX> i guess not <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX> but yeah i would say <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five years ago</TIMEX> turning off my fountain i mean my water faucet in the sink when i brush my teeth
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but i didn't realize that was the biggest waste of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> that was surprising to me
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um
 	
 	
 		i missed that question totally i mean really bad i'm trying to think i didn't miss too many i can't remember what my score was but i did exceeding well i was surprised
 		but i didn't realize that our garbage isn't being decomposed that was a shocker to me
 	
 	
 		yeah well there are a lot of things that aren't i'm that's uh one of the things i wonder about uh one of the questions was do you think more should be done or something else i i wonder about some of the products products that they don't take like some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plastics</ENAMEX> and things that they don't take
 		uh why why they couldn't do more recycling with those
 	
 	
 		well i was in uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bizmart</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the other day</TIMEX> and what i don't understand is there is recycled paper in there and it cost more than regular paper
 		than regular paper
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		and it was only i think uh <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">forty cents</NUMEX> more you know fifty <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">cents</NUMEX> more but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it upseted me to realize that hey the recycling that they're going through the expense of recycling but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> aren't buying it so the cost of it is higher
 	
 	
 		true yeah i noticed that about things like i seen i seen a lot of adds recently for organic fertilizers
 		and lawn <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">additives</ENAMEX> and that type of thing but the cost is is like double or sometimes triple what the regular things you <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fertilizers</ENAMEX> and things you buy so in in terms of that it's you know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		for the environment it its there is good reason to do it the cost is kind of prohibited
 	
 	
 		now see that's recycling
 		you know <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> that do at least go into it i'd like to see subsidy by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> or something or taxwise or something heavily enough to where they could get their prices lower than regular
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> would use this stuff reuse over again
 	
 	
 		yeah it's a good idea
 	
 	
 		it's like when he was saying uh which one was recyclable which was reusable and the recycle ones are better to use but lots of times you don't even see the signs on the bottles
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah true
 	
 	
 		and if we're going to really do something they ought to put that stuff out bigger for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to see it
 		i had to put my bifocals on to see it
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		that's hard when you're in a grocery <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX> and you're short anyway  you have to get enough nerve to ask somebody to take something off the top shelf you haven't got enough nerve to say well put it back it's not recyclable
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i i'd heard something stranger talk about bottles <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the other day</TIMEX> on uh
 		on the radio station i think it's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K L T Y</ENAMEX> they were talking about the i think it's in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> they're using oh recyclable milk jugs plastic milk jugs
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		as a a reinforcement for <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX> for road repairs
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		and apparently they they don't break down very easily and
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		they don't expand or or contract when the weather changes and  this is kind of an unusual use for
 		that type of thing
 	
 	
 		well you know they're along that same line they said they were using um
 		what is oh i know it was toilets smashing the m up because they're that stuff there is great for in road work
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		huh
 	
 	
 		and i thought well that's good and then i saw recycling on tires between uh well hoses were being used
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh uh soaker hoses made out of old tires what else something else was made out of old tires i was trying to remember what it was
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		oh i can't think of it now
 		but i was i was trying to get my uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> you know to see different things that we could come up with for recycling purposes
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and just anything to you know recycle rather than keep throwing it away but my biggest problem is i take the bags out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX> buy the bags to bring them back and then i forget to bring them in the store
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i'm forever going back out to my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> to pick up my bags to bring them and take my garbage back out i wish they'd really push this recycling bit because i never realized i really didn't realize how much stuff i actually throw away
 	
 	
 		well i think the the more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are aware of it the the more they'll do i think that's just the biggest problem is keeping it in in front of the public so they understand how serious the problem is and how important it is to do that
 	
 	
 		you know what i'd like to see a little more i don't have any little tiny <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> but if they get the little tiny <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> saving it now
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five years</TIMEX> when they get bigger it'll work a little bit more too
 	
 	
 		true
 	
 	
 		because it's we've all got to do it right now i just
 		i really amazed to find out that what is it eighty <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">per cent</NUMEX> are filled now in in garbage fills in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five years</TIMEX> we're supposed to be at max
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i don't think i can keep my own garbage
 		i mean i might not have that much
 		but i would
