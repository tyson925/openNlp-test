 
     		
 	
 		okay you've do you have a uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</TIMEX> budget
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		well um
 		we we do but not an official one i mean basically we know we have i i think i'm a little crazy in that we keep so many different savings accounts
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		we'll have our checking account that's just the the money that we use and spend
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and then we have a savings account which is money where we work our credit cards in such a way that we charge everything and then we write it out like it was a check
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so we're never we pay off our bills in full we're not paying any interest but it's not a big surprise if we get a large bill because we have it all written out already
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and then we have another checking account another savings account which is like for heavy duty savings you know that's just taken out of our paychecks every week
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and then we have a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a fourth</NUMEX> sort of CD type arrangement um where you know it's in a CD and we can't get to it
 		so i guess our budget is just what's in our checkbook we don't say we have x amount for entertainment x amount for gas it's just we know <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">some weeks</TIMEX> we might be able to go out for dinner <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> times <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">some weeks one time some weeks</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times
 		um so there's nothing really that we have written down for a budget
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but i'm a saver i would rather if i had <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty extra</TIMEX> dollars i would rather save it than spend it and that's my philosophy and um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		sometimes i i you know i think that that's not necessarily the best way to live but i i always think that you're going to need it for a rainy day you know how about you
 	
 	
 		right
 		well we're very very similar we i have worked
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		for a goal of saving <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three months</TIMEX>' salary
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		and and we put that uh in a account
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and we just leave it there that's our emergency account if the car breaks down i mean we can take money out of that but you know then our goal after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next month</TIMEX> is to rebuild it <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">up to three months</TIMEX>' salary
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		right
 	
 	
 		now we've only we've recently done that so now we have extra money
 		we don't have to slap in that account so we're looking into mutual funds or uh just uh common stock you know anything like that that we can get a higher return on our money
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh see we do have the checking account we have <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carla</ENAMEX> works for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> so she has a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CODA</ENAMEX> plan you know where she puts in if they put in a dollar she she puts in a dollar you know <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> pays fifty cents
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh that's great
 	
 	
 		it's sort of like a matching fund then she gets like <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">eight percent</NUMEX> interest on top of that so that's been uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		pretty juicy for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last couple of years</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah that's wonderful
 	
 	
 		and
 	
 	
 		one nice thing that my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> does um and i know this is going on all over the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> but
 		they allow you to put into um a certain fund
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		whatever you think some of your major medical expenses are going to be for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> such as any prescriptions um if you wear glasses or contacts any expenses you might have for that
 		any dental expenses you anticipate if you have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> day care that sort of thing um outside of a major medical hospitalization problem anything that that might be medically related
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and so you claim that amount at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the beginning of the year</TIMEX> let's say you determine that's <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">five hundred dollars</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		they'll withhold <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">five hundred dollars</NUMEX> from your paycheck um broken up into fifty <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks</TIMEX> so whatever that is divided by fifty two
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and what what in in a sense happens is you end up paying those bills in pretax dollars
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		do you have something like that
 	
 	
 		no well they may have we just haven't taken advantage of it
 	
 	
 		it's really wonderful in our case we don't have that many medical expenses thank God and so i only claim <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">two hundred dollars</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so i my salary in a sense was lowered by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">two hundred dollars</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and they break that up into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> dollars and eighty <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">five cents</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a week</TIMEX> that's taken out automatically and then if i go and get my teeth cleaned for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> dollars
 		i pay the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> dollars and then i send it in to the it's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blue Choice</ENAMEX> i send it in to them and then they send me a check back for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> dollars but the nice thing is that that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> dollars i wasn't taxed on
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		initially because it it almost looked like i never made that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> dollars and it's really wonderful if i this is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first year</TIMEX> we did it and uh next year
 		i i'm just going to claim a lot more if you don't spend it all then you do lose it but i feel we could have benefitted from even <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">two hundred dollars</NUMEX> more from it
 	
 	
 		huh so
 	
 	
 		but uh it's a nice little savings account and then they they tell you if you'd like you can put the money that you save by not paying taxes into a savings account and they'll do like what you mentioned about matching it and that sort of thing
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but um
 	
 	
 		so if you don't use it in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one year</TIMEX> you lose the hum
 	
 	
 		yes if you don't lose it so if you decided to claim or or put aside <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">five hundred dollars</NUMEX> and you only spent <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> fifty
 		they let you know <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each quarter</TIMEX> and they'll let you know you have <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">three hundred dollars</NUMEX> left <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">two hundred dollars</NUMEX> left but if it gets to be <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the year</TIMEX> and you haven't spent that fifty then you do lose it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well it's time to go get your teeth cleaned again
 	
 	
 		yeah right  or just buy a new set of glasses or  or whatever
 	
 	
 		oh yeah that's that's true too
 	
 	
 		but i i don't know how <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> can really live on a budget our i mean a budget that's really written out
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um you know this amount of dollars because you your life just fluctuates so much and i mean <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each week</TIMEX> is so different <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">some weeks</TIMEX> you're just going to go over that and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">some weeks</TIMEX> you're going to go under and so to me it's just easier to
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well there again we both have the natural tendency to save and like so if we have the extra money we're going to slap it away as opposed to someone else who goes out and blows it
 	
 	
 		i don't know
 		yeah that's true that's true
 		right
 		that's true yeah a very good point
 	
 	
 		so for those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that are in debt like you said you pay your credit card off at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the month</TIMEX> and so do we because i hate interest
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right oh i hate it too
 	
 	
 		so i mean but some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> don't care about interest
 	
 	
 		well you you know some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> look at their their credit card limit as a loan in a sense and they um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know if their limit is twenty <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">five hundred dollars</NUMEX> if they have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred</NUMEX> left they'll spend that because they think they have it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and then will just end up paying interest for the rest of their lives practically
 	
 	
 		right it's a vicious circle
 	
 	
 		yeah it really is
 	
 	
 		yeah credit cards are good if you use them correctly
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but they can be very dangerous if you don't
 	
 	
 		oh they sure can that's for sure
 	
 	
 		especially yeah that interest is terrible
 	
 	
 		i know
 		and you know they send these applications out to college <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> and college <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX> gets an application that says y ou've been approved for this amount of credit
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		automatic approval
 		and they get them and then these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> start charging and
 		and they get themselves into some deep trouble before they even start making money they're already in debt you know let alone loans and stuff
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		
 
 		no kidding
 	
 	
 		but
 	
 	
 		but
 		yeah that sounds like you uh now what are you doing you've got your big <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">master</ENAMEX> savings account that you're going to use to retire on or something or
 	
 	
 		well it'll be a long time before that's something we can retire on but um
 		it's yeah it's just uh something that's automatically taken out of our paychecks <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each week</TIMEX> and uh it goes for an emergency we had a disastrous storm here <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about seven weeks ago</TIMEX> and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rochester</ENAMEX> was in a state of emergency for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three weeks</TIMEX> and everyone lost their power and we had to pay over <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">five hundred dollars</NUMEX> to have a tree removed
 	
 	
 		oh man
 	
 	
 		and it wasn't covered by insurance so that's something where you you don't plan on it's not something that you can you know you're not saving for a trip or whatever it's boom here it is
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and you just have to pay for it so it's an emergency fund but when we got married we you know obviously got some money and that that's what's put in the CD
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and to me i i try and forget that we even have that because i don't want to think about that um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but it would be nice to just not always think about saving like have a have a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty</TIMEX> dollar bill and think oh maybe we'll just go out and buy something with this and it'll come
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah yeah we i just did that my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>'s birthday was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> and yeah so
 	
 	
 		ah really
 	
 	
 		i'm very tight you know with my cash and we haven't really we don't go to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">malls</ENAMEX> and shop because they're too expensive and you know we'll buy things here and there but she had we haven't really went shopping for her
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		oh yeah it'll
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and you know but she's been really good and she hasn't really said much and i go well look you know <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> we're going to go out and get something so we went out and blew <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about a hundred</NUMEX> bucks but you know for us that's a that's huge for me you know but you know some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> do it every weekend
 	
 	
 		oh isn't it great
 		oh i know you mean um-hum
 		oh it's incredible
 	
 	
 		but
 	
 	
 		we really do
 		i i i like discount <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> i have no problem with buying an a no name brand of something
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um i'm not into labels and that sort of thing
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		our fire our smoke detector's going off  making <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> fries
 	
 	
 		uh oh you're not cooking are you
 	
 	
 		um my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>'s making <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fries</ENAMEX>  or burning <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> fries one or the other but um
 	
 	
 		that's funny
 	
 	
 		i feel fortunate that my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> instilled in me you know a sense to save and and you know watch where your money goes
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i that's very valuable yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		well that's good
