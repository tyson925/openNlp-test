 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah i like having <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat cats</ENAMEX> around or <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pets</ENAMEX> around in general i i favor <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs over cats</ENAMEX> actually but
 	
 	
 		oh see i'm not uh i'm not a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> at all
 	
 	
 		oh i'm i'm a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> i had i guess it depends on what you had when he were a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX> right
 	
 	
 		yeah probably i was allergic to <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> when i was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX> in fact i may still be um we
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		but not cats
 	
 	
 		not um i wonder sometimes  um but we um we house sat for a um my um my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boss</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple weeks ago</TIMEX> and um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh he has a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> and everything we were you know we were sitting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> and everything and uh i felt like just miserable <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all weekend</TIMEX> and it really didn't dawn on me until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> it was like hey maybe you're still allergic to the dog it was like oh that could be it
 	
 	
 		well the thing i don't like about <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> sometimes is that the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> will just reek
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> and constantly
 	
 	
 		well
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> are real high maintenances you got to take them for walks and you've got to pay a lot you know you need to pay attention to <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> and everything but it's not quite the same thing um and um
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true
 	
 	
 		um you know it's
 		it's just nice that <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> you know <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> yeah you don't have to let them outside you know our <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> are indoor <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> so you know they're not you worry you're not worried about them running all around the neighborhood and you know they you know they they make their mess in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> pan which is
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">limited</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah it's you know it's a pain to clean but you know we used to i mean they got great stuff out now for cleaning <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX>' pans they didn't
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		well when i was you know when i was growing up i had a clean the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> pan all the time and i hated it because i had to carry everything upstairs and you know and use this thing to you know scoop the take the stuff out and put it in the toilet and everything it was really terrible but now they have like this you get these liners
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		that is garbage bags you know and you and you you know the
 	
 	
 		oh that sounds so easy what i did
 	
 	
 		yeah the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> do it in there you pull it and take it out and throw it away and that's it
 	
 	
 		yeah i <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX> sat some cats
 		for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> of mine which she was finishing up her thesis and what we used to do was just put um newspaper on the bottom and then put <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat litter</ENAMEX> and then i would just take the whole thing to the garbage can and dump the whole thing
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		same idea
 	
 	
 		then i would do it you know <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">everyday or two days</TIMEX> so i would clean that pan very very rarely and so it wasn't so bad well she had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> and just as easy it just never started smelling i would put just a little bit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> litter there
 	
 	
 		everyday oh okay i see
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		because if i put a lot one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> would had been all of her <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> that she ever had were adopted is that true yeah she's even got she's got <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> dog now and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> and her
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		dog there is is basically a reject somebody had bought him and wanted him it was her ex <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boyfriend</ENAMEX> and you know just was not mature enough to keep the dog didn't realize how much work it was and now she's stuck with it and she's just so kindhearted that she just takes all the animals
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but i think that for me well my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> just has completely nixed the idea of having a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> or a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> because that's all there is to it so you know
 	
 	
 		
 
 		so you don't have anything right now
 	
 	
 		no we don't have anything right now
 	
 	
 		oh except the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid huh</ENAMEX> that's
 	
 	
 		oh right  now we have a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX> but he was no completely against having a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> he said they're much
 		they're as much work as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX> and they're harder to get rid of for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the weekend</TIMEX>
 		and
 	
 	
 		uh i don't i don't know because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> pretty much um yeah you know we can leave them for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a weekend</TIMEX> as long as we put plenty of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> out
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and um uh it's not a big deal really i mean they're they're happier when we're around but you know they they're pretty much okay by themselves um and i don't you know we couldn't do that with a dog
 	
 	
 		that's uh yeah  really true but like the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> of mine have cats they have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> of them
 		and if they go away they have they hire a pet <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sitter</ENAMEX> to come in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twice a day</TIMEX> and pet them and things like that and their <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> you know their so use to the attention that if they don't get it they get really upset
 		and you know they sort of cause trouble around the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and things like that
 	
 	
 		well that's
 		that's um
 		pampering the the pet a little
 	
 	
 		yeah i i tried to have um figured  having <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pets</ENAMEX> so i tried to have a goldfish
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and um i killed that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> within a very short amount of time
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but they're not that much fun you know you can't take them for a walk you can't you know they they don't they can't fetch you know they can't they can't do anything so i've never
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i think we had fish  when i was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX> but i don't
 	
 	
 		my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> had fish when i was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX> i remember that and one of his <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> jumped out of the um
 		gosh what do you call it fish tank
 		and fried itself  on the radiator behind the dresser i'll never forget that because i remember my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> he came home and he counted the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> and one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> was missing and they couldn't find it anyplace they couldn't figure out what had happened and then they found it fried on the radiator behind
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		well it was not that gross i didn't see it but um  he got them trying to remember we had a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> for a while
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and i don't know if we got rid of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> because my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> was allergic to it my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> had asthma and some <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">allergies</ENAMEX> which i think he's outgrown now but because of that we didn't have very many <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pets</ENAMEX> afterwards and then he had fish
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and you they're like you say they're not the most exciting pet to have
 	
 	
 		no it's like i just i don't know i i just never understood why what the attraction i mean they're you know they're pretty and everything but i've just never seen the attraction of having fish
 		it's not as much fun
 	
 	
 		well a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> of mine had um an eel
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and then he had a um i forget what type of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> it was it was one of these <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> that i it would eat it ate a big other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> and things like that there would be sort of moby <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> in a tank
 	
 	
 		oh now we really get sick
 	
 	
 		yeah and it
 		i i couldn't see having fish like that i could see sort of having maybe some of the tropical <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> that are really really pretty but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		like i remember a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> of mine at work telling me that at his frat in college that they had a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tank</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">piranha</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh you know used to drop <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> in it's like this is not these aren't pets  you know this is gross
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah no that would be what did they do everyone come around and watch them i mean i guess that's fine if you have a mouse problem at your frat <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and you just destroyed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yep
 		yeah well
 	
 	
 		but
 	
 	
 		yeah well a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> will do the same trick
 	
 	
 		let's see i had a pet <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX>  for a while
 		and it was a live <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> and
 		um this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> just offered it to me while i was in in graduate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> and she was actually a very fun pet
 	
 	
 		i had a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> in college
 		i had a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> in college who had a um had a pet <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> for a while um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i forget how she got it but it was um it was the same kind of a deal i think she got it i think she was a psych major and she got it from the psych department
 	
 	
 		yeah <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mine</ENAMEX> had been a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a a</TIMEX>
 		how did this work a male <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> had been bought and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in the lab <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX> called in my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> and said you know this <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> is acting really strange i think he's sick and she said i don't think he's sick i think she's pregnant
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and they had misclassified the sex of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">the uh rat</ENAMEX> there and so um she asked me if i want to one of those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">babies</ENAMEX> and i took the baby and i got her when she was you know just this tiniest little thing like half the size of a mouse
 	
 	
 		oops
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and then she grew to be you know i had pictures of her when she would sit on my hand and then she grew to be pretty big you know like a pound or something i don't know how much and i had her for over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</TIMEX> and she was very affectionate she would you know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		crawl on me and she would sit like on my neck or my shoulder while i was working and things like that yeah much more than you would think
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh yeah i mean you know if you get them young and everything before they go kind of nuts so yeah <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> are not my favorite <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> in the world but i could see getting <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> from birth and everything
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and
 		yeah i sort of weird for me to have had one too but there it was a convenient little pet to have because it stayed in it's <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cage</ENAMEX> and you know it was easy easy to take care of and but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i i i have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> with hamsters and gerbils and they they tell me the same thing i just again it gets into these aren't much fun  you know what i guess they can be i
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		actually it was more fun than you would think
 		yeah  starting from the
 		beginning but um yeah we live also live in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> now actually in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manhattan</ENAMEX> and so it's
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		almost impossible
 		it's not fair to a pet to have a pet here or certainly certainly not a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> i mean <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> do
 	
 	
 		right
 		oh people
 	
 	
 		but it just not
 	
 	
 		i don't oh plus i mean their's a pooper scooper on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> so yeah
 	
 	
 		oh yeah you see all these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> yeah these stately <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and well dressed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> out walking their <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> with their plastic bag or their piece of paper for them it's really kind of funny
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i was living in northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jersey</ENAMEX> when that law came through remember hearing all about it we were wondering if they uh they had any special law for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Central Park</ENAMEX> of course not
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		right no they don't actually they do they have um the bags behind them but i think they're actually supposed to
 		they keep them yeah keep them clean but oh gosh i can't even walk by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central Park</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		hit the bags
 	
 	
 		yeah when summertime just the smell is so bad
