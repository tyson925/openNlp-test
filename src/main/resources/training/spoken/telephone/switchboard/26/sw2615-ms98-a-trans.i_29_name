 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i don't know what the the last thing i've done as far as car repairs go is is change oil and filter an and that kind of stuff i haven't gotten really involved in anything
 		uh extensive in car repairs in oh oh probably <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year or so</TIMEX> i think the last thing i did of any significance was change the water pump on an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oldsmobile</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah i had a similar thing that i've worked on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> ever since i was uh a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX>  and that was some time ago but i've gotten to the point where uh the newer <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> are getting so complicated to work on that uh
 		oh most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> i buy i try to buy as simple a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> as possible so you know changing the oil changing the spark plugs and most of them now you know you don't go through the ignition stuff anymore because that's all solid state or
 	
 	
 		yeah i know what you mean
 		yeah
 		they're fuel injected and so there's
 	
 	
 		or fuel injected so there goes the carburetor and if the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fuel</ENAMEX> injection system breaks down there's no way in the world you're going to work on that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		no there's no way somebody once said uh i had a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> that said <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fuel</ENAMEX> injection on the side of it and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> asked me what that meant and i said that means that i can't work on it you know they've gotten so complicated or so high tech that uh
 	
 	
 		oh yeah yeah basically that's it
 	
 	
 		the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> average <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> can't really go out in the in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garage</ENAMEX> and do a whole lot of repairs uh
 	
 	
 		yeah i've got uh an <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eighty four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chevy</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">van</ENAMEX> that's uh a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">one ton</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">van</ENAMEX> with a camper conversion on it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's got the the the good old <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> fifty standard engine in it regular gas engine and that engine i understand i can i can actually work on that engine
 	
 	
 		absolutely
 		yeah i used to have uh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chevy</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">van</ENAMEX> it was a short van that had the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the three fifty</TIMEX> in it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-hum
 	
 	
 		and basically it it was a motor and you didn't have all the other junk around it and you could get to it to work on it
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah
 		i had to change the water pump in that here <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about a year ago</TIMEX> and it was really fairly easy take the grill out and the radiator out and you can just stand there and work on it
 	
 	
 		yeah the hardest part about uh water pump changes is getting all the junk off before you can get too it
 	
 	
 		well that's true  you're right you know by the time you've finally got down to it i was hoping i could remember where all those other things went
 	
 	
 		well that's kind of the way i was i tried to remember as i took stuff off where it went and i don't think i had too many nuts and bolts left over when i got it all put back together
 	
 	
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few years ago</TIMEX> i had an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oldsmobile</ENAMEX> diesel and uh the uh it after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about a hundred thousand</NUMEX> miles the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">injector</ENAMEX> pump went out on it and uh i bought it when we were living in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lubbock</ENAMEX> when i came back here i brought the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> back here and uh
 		i don't know diesels got pretty unpopular and you couldn't sell the thing i mean though for what you could get for one you might as well drive it over a cliff and uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">injector</ENAMEX> pump went bad so i
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		found an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outfit</ENAMEX> down here to rebuild it and uh i reinstalled that and that was probably one of the most miserable things i had gotten into in a long time
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i don't think i'd know where to start with a diesel
 	
 	
 		uh well if you know diesels don't require <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mechanics</ENAMEX> they require plumbers
 	
 	
 		well that's true
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		i think the only closest thing i've come to to a diesel is i've worked for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">tractor</ENAMEX> repair <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX> uh when i was in high school and uh we used to overhaul farm tractors basically
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and they were nearly all all diesel but as far as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> i've never never been involved with them
 	
 	
 		well the injector nozzle and stuff in you know the big diesel farm <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">tractors</ENAMEX> you know what are about the size of your
 		thumb and the yeah you can get to them and the ones in in the diesel <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> were little tiny things and just almost impossible to do anything with
 	
 	
 		well yeah yeah and you can you can get to them
 		well i
 	
 	
 		i've had a lot of good service out of that car but uh uh i finally gave it to my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> and he drove it literally into the ground you know  he was out at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tech</ENAMEX> and he he finished it off
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i'm
 		i guess you're right the the diesel has almost fallen into unpopular status i don't know exactly why <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the reasons is i i'm beginning to wonder is where do you get <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> at i sure i don't know if it's still
 		uh limited like it was i don't notice it probably because i don't huh
 	
 	
 		what the availability
 		you mean the diesel availability
 	
 	
 		yeah i don't i don't notice but maybe because i'm not looking for it yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah well i'd bought uh a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GMC</ENAMEX> diesel pickup
 		and uh loved that thing you know i really liked it but it turns out a pickup wasn't what i really
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		needed and it was the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">van</ENAMEX> that i needed then to buying the you know traded it in on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chevy</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">van</ENAMEX> but uh sure enjoyed it
 	
 	
 		but you you got the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the three fifty</TIMEX> in the van
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> fifty regular gas engine
 	
 	
 		yeah that's what i like because they've got plenty of power and uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		if you treat them right they're not the gas guzzlers i think that they've got the reputation to be i'm convinced that uh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Detroit</ENAMEX> or whoever it is made a major mistake <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX> when they stopped putting the small V eights in and went to the fours and some of the sixes
 	
 	
 		yeah well
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i'm convinced that the small V <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> like the the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mustang</ENAMEX>'s original <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two eighty nine</NUMEX> or some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chevy</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two eighty</NUMEX> threes
 		were good little V <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> engines that were not gas guzzlers but they had enough power to pull all this weight And the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> cylinders just don't have it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i think that little the little <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chevy</ENAMEX> V <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> when it started out in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixty</TIMEX> in fifty <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> i think was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two sixty five</NUMEX> something like that little
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know not a hold lot more than the than the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> cylinder that i think was like about for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about two thirty five</TIMEX> or something but uh
 		they kept boring that block out to where you could a get a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four hundred</NUMEX> small block <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four hundred</NUMEX> that was uh the same block you know just just kept boring it out and boring it out and stroking it a little bit more yeah
 	
 	
 		i think those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> those little <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V</ENAMEX> eights could have been made to be pretty powerful little engines if they would have gone with it but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well that was uh that was a short stroke engine it could really wind up
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two little</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> i've got now
 		bought a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitsubishi Mirage</ENAMEX> here <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple years ago</TIMEX> and and it was normally carbureted and it's fairly easy to work with because there's not just a whole lot in it to go wrong and you know changing the plugs and stuff
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah that's kind of like
 		the the first well my <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> was a fifty <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mustang</ENAMEX> and uh over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</TIMEX> uh all i had a uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dodge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pickup</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several years ago</TIMEX> and uh i can't remember the size of the engine it was a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">O</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> or something like that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh i remember working on those <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> you'd open the hood and there was basically nothing in there but an engine and a few things Now you open the hood and it's scary like you say it takes a plumber to figure out where all this stuff goes yeah
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 		the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> of ours over here he's got uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixty five or sixty six Mustang</TIMEX> with the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> cylinder
 		and uh i was look under the hood of that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the other day</TIMEX> and like you say you can see the road it's amazing
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well if you had to you could climb up in there and do what you needed to
 	
 	
 		you could yeah you could stand in there if you really wanted to i guess
 	
 	
 		my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX>'s got a new um i guess it's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an eighty nine</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ninety</NUMEX> uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> something or other it's one those transverse mounted V sixes front wheel drive
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh he was showing it to me and we're looking under the hood and everything's nice and clean and you know you can see the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> spark plugs there in the front And i said well where are the other three
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and he had never really thou ght about it And he says well hopefully i won't have to change them before i trade it off Yeah it's going to be a problem getting back there because it was shoved right up against the fire wall
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so they just about complicated the things so much that shade tree <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mechanics</ENAMEX> can't do much with them uh-huh
 	
 	
 		yeah well when they went to the started with the newer engines you know when they started putting all that pollution control stuff on the older engines is where they started getting into so much you know trouble because the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> fifty with all the
 		you know like <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">well</ENAMEX> actually i guess here <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">within a couple of years ago</TIMEX> anyway was the last i've paid any attention to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">it the three O five</ENAMEX> was that that V <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> that they put in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the three quarter</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">and half ton</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">van</ENAMEX> and it had all the air pump and uh
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh i don't know all that all that stuff and all the antismog stuff and uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> that was uh really a mess back under there under the in that van
 	
 	
 		yeah the antismog pumps
 		and all that stuff loads the motor down
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so it's trying to push the weight plus
 		have all this drain on it from all sorts of
 		belts and things
 		but that's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> good thing i've got a uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight ninety</NUMEX> uh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chevy</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Blazer</ENAMEX> now and it's got <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> uh belt on it a serpentine belt
 	
 	
 		oh it's that one that's about uh what <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">an inch and a half</NUMEX> wide got a bunch of groves in it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i haven't had to replace the thing yet it looks like it would be uh better than having i've got an an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Olds Tornado</ENAMEX> that i think's got <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> belts on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sucker</ENAMEX> And i had to get all those off you know when i was replace that uh water pump and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i had to struggle with that for a while to figure which belt goes where
 	
 	
 		yeah it's kind of like the inside dual on a truck you know when one of them breaks it's not the outside one it's it's the it's usually that power steering belt or something that's way back in there  everything's got to come off
 	
 	
 		oh man
 		you bet everything else's got to come off first well it's a pleasure meeting you
 	
 	
 		yeah and we'll uh how many times have you done this now is this
 	
 	
 		uh i've got uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> stickers here from <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> so i guess i've done probably uh i'd say <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> of them
 	
 	
 		yeah i hadn't uh hadn't not gotten any calls here in the last uh this is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> one in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a week or so</TIMEX> and
 	
 	
 		yeah i haven't gotten any calls in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks</TIMEX> so i don't know if if it's tapering off or what i had a difficult time <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past couple of times</TIMEX> of getting uh answers so it sounds it's taken them <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">ten fifteen minutes</TIMEX> at a time so
 	
 	
 		if it's
 		winding down or what
 		finding a taker
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> or either not or maybe they're burned out or they're through with it anyway let you go thanks for talking
 	
 	
 		yeah well
 		okay all righty bye-bye
