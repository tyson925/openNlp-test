 
     		
 	
 		well i guess uh the topic uh being favorite TV shows i uh i guess i could start by saying i'm just looking forward to uh watching the astronomers on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh yes that
 	
 	
 		and uh unfortunately they're having a  like but they're having the uh a uh not telethon but a uh auction on on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> here and
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 		i'd noticed that in the in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TV Guide</ENAMEX> and i'd totally forgotten all about that
 	
 	
 		um-hum and
 	
 	
 		and it looks like it would be an a good series
 	
 	
 		well the first uh episode started out pretty slow but after that it uh obviously has been preempted by the auction <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last week or so</TIMEX> so it uh i guess i'll never know
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but uh and you
 	
 	
 		oh i i have a very wide range of uh uh different shows that i like uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh it's i mean i mean even the what is it <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Funniest Videos</ENAMEX> there's just there's something about that i don't i don't know if it's the simplicity of it or just the total stupidity of it  that is good
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		
 
 		yeah well it's it is enjoyable i'll give you that it's funny
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and uh uh i i don't i don't get to watch TV that often or sit back and enjoy it i have a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nine month</TIMEX> old so that occupies a lot of the time
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		i would imagine about the only time i usually preempt for i think like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> we usually uh watch a lot of TV because that's when <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Murphy Brown and uh and Designing Women</ENAMEX> a lot of those shows are on we tend to watch always catch those
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah those are good i like uh <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">In the Heat of the Night</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and
 		In the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Heat of the Night</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		that's uh that is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carroll O'Connor</ENAMEX> yeah
 	
 	
 		uh yeah right uh that that's had some good episodes to it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and then plus and then of course you have to have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> soap opera
 	
 	
 		well okay
 	
 	
 		uh right i i i mean at least <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Knot</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Landing</ENAMEX> or something on that order
 	
 	
 		yeah well i guess i guess now that they've uh got rid of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> which we uh we tend to watch religiously here at uh at at least we're getting ready for the big final episode
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right right i've been uh i tend to i try to catch that every <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">now and then</TIMEX> and i mean you still catch up with it you know <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every couple of weeks</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah i
 		it's it's funny how they're uh now that the show's over they're kind of trying to complete all of these uh stories
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		in a very short period of time so it's like you turn on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about eighty seven</NUMEX> things happen in an episode now
 	
 	
 		right yeah i been trying to catch it <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last few weeks</TIMEX> so i can see how it ends
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		um-hum i guess uh the only rumor i've heard that they had in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX> so far is that uh the last episode is supposed to be like uh it's a wonderful life for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JR</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh no
 	
 	
 		so it's uh what what would life had been like if he would had not been born there something like that so uh it's
 	
 	
 		
 
 		should be interesting right lots of tongue in cheek
 	
 	
 		it's going to be funny i bet
 		something something tells me <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry Hagman</ENAMEX>'s going to milk this role that uh all it's worth
 	
 	
 		right he's uh uh with him producing it it it he hasn't done a bad job
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		no no not at all not at all that's uh that's true
 		but
 	
 	
 		we uh sort of get a kick out of the Simpsons
 	
 	
 		oh do you i i very rarely unfortunately it it comes on a little early here and i sometimes i'm usually at work but they moved it to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thursdays</ENAMEX> and i guess that's what uh
 		but uh yeah the the few times that i've been able to see it it's uh at first i didn't think so
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and when i <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> saw it i i haven't been able to see it very often but when i <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> saw it i said well well this looks like it's it's going to you know go over like a lead balloon it uh doesn't look like it's going to be good at all
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but the few times i've seen it i guess it's something that grows on you
 	
 	
 		it it definitely grows on you and you think that it's
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so far fetched you know with the normal family life that uh but
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every now</TIMEX> and then they'll surprise you and have a moral to it and they do the right thing
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		the the big thing i always hear about is i guess at the beginning they always open it a little differently where they all run to the sofa
 	
 	
 		yeah right and uh the things that uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bart</ENAMEX> will write on the uh chalk <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> at school
 	
 	
 		yeah that's it and then sometimes you know the it's like one episode i guess the sofa wasn't even there and they all just stood there and looked at each other and and stuff like that so so i hear a lot about that
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and uh it's almost it's almost up there with uh <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Saturday Night Live</ENAMEX> i guess is the big now with that is the the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> with uh
 		you know like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve uh Steve Meister</ENAMEX> and and it's like wherever i go anymore i've uh i get got a chance not only to to visit a few <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> and all that around here and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's like you walk into a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lobbies</ENAMEX> of those places it's like you know <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ralph Ralph Meister Ralphster</ENAMEX> and uh it's uh
 	
 	
 		right we do that a lot at work
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">yep</ENAMEX> so it's like that's something that's really really taken off but uh
 	
 	
 		right uh yeah there there're a lot of things come off of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Saturday Night Live</ENAMEX> that uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		get caught up into the normal everyday routine
 	
 	
 		right right because uh isn't that special i guess is the last <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> with uh with the church <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX> but uh
 	
 	
 		yeah right
 		and uh
 		oh what was the one that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gilda Radner</ENAMEX> did
 	
 	
 		oh uh
 		uh it's always not it's always something but uh
 	
 	
 		oh and and i'm i'm and i'm real good at it too well well no it's not in that special that uh well anyway but you know what i'm saying there's you know things will get picked up from it and uh
 	
 	
 		when she
 		oh what was that
 		yeah uh-huh
 		um-hum get caught in the regular conversation anymore
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		right oh yeah well TV's on constantly here whenever we're at home
 	
 	
 		well especially if you have a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nine month</TIMEX> that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nine month old</TIMEX> that probably how about uh have you watched the the what's that new show <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Baby Talk or</ENAMEX> or the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> with where they take off of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Who's Talking</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh i've seen one of  i've seen one part of an episode
 	
 	
 		yeah i haven't seen any of it yet but was it was it any good
 	
 	
 		it didn't do anything for me i
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh uh we like <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Look Who's Talking</ENAMEX> you know and this just wasn't anything to me like it
 	
 	
 		yeah um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know with uh wasn't it <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce Willis</ENAMEX> that did the voice but uh you know there's just something with that
 	
 	
 		yeah um-hum
 		i guess we're also looking forward to the uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> it's it's terrible that i guess we watch so much television but uh i guess the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> other thing we're watching for i guess <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LA Law</ENAMEX> has uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last couple couple</TIMEX> episodes coming up here
 	
 	
 		yes
 		right i've been catching that that's been real interesting
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		that was that was so wild when they when they got rid of uh the one uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actress</ENAMEX> uh Dey
 	
 	
 		yes the one that fell down the yes
 	
 	
 		a an elevator shaft that was that was pretty  it's like we we were all
 	
 	
 		i was like wait i missed that rewind rewind rewind here
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah it was like we were all sitting here going what just happened  i'd say if you if if you if you weren't watching it was like boom you missed it and it's like next thing you know they're all just looking down the shaft going you know what happened
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		uh so it uh and now with uh all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> you know rising in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX> and going off to join uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michael</ENAMEX> i guess whoever uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum it looks like it's gonna the last few episodes are going to be good
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah matter of fact uh i guess that's going to be the same same same uh what <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> and uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LA Law</ENAMEX> and a lot of these are really uh i guess are really going for a lot of cliffhangers this year
 	
 	
 		right and well and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LA Law</ENAMEX> is getting rid of several of their characters
 	
 	
 		and they keep uh
 		that's what i heard i guess uh like like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Susan Dey</ENAMEX> and a few of them are up for contract renewal and they didn't do it or something like that
 	
 	
 		yeah uh see i heard that uh they wanted to keep it fresh and did not have the same ones there forever and so they would be bringing in new ones or whatever
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
  
 		yeah because i
 		it it's pretty obvious though like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corbin Benson</ENAMEX> is probably not going to be there long because he's been starring in these uh miniseries and and his part's gotten smaller and smaller and they're bringing on the uh like the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> who uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i guess her and and the blonde uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">district attorney</ENAMEX> or went went to teach that seminar to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> uh <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> at the uh
 	
 	
 		yes
 		oh yeah uh
 		at the swimming pool
 	
 	
 		at the swimming pool there in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Palm Springs</ENAMEX> and uh you can see they're really starting to build up their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> and they've they've kind of really down played like uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corbin Benson</ENAMEX> and uh few of those uh the top ones <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harry Hamlin</ENAMEX> a lot of them
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah see i think
 		yeah and those i know that those <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> were supposed to leave and i don't remember about uh
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		oh what is it uh Sprinchez
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
