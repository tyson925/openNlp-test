 
     		
 	
 		all right you want to start out
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well it'll be real easy for us because we're both my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> and i are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vegetarians</ENAMEX> so yeah so that's the first thing we look for is if we can eat there or not
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh are you really
 		oh
 		are you strict <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vegetarians</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		we're not vegan <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vegetarians</ENAMEX> we do we're ovolacto we do eat uh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX> and and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk products</ENAMEX> i used to be a complete vegan vegetarian where i didn't eat any animal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">products</ENAMEX> at all
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but um it was it's really difficult in the area if you don't have you know the products that you can get and if you go out to dinner there's virtually you know there's not a whole lot of things you can get
 	
 	
 		there's very few places that you i'll bet that you could uh
 	
 	
 		yeah i think maybe if you were somewhere like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> where they have a lot more vegetarian <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> and stuff but here basically you go to an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX> or you go to a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX> you know where you can get <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know where you have a little bit more variety as far as the pastas or the the corn <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meal</ENAMEX> you know or something
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah and you wouldn't have the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meat products</ENAMEX> in that and some
 	
 	
 		but
 		yeah yeah you have to watch that too all you know some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> here they will you know like you can ask them and they'll tell you whether or not they use like lard or you know animal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fat</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cook</ENAMEX> with
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so but so that's that we don't really eat out too much we we tend to eat at home and actually you know i think we we we get a have we have a healthier diet than the average person
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh how long have you been doing  this
 	
 	
 		um i've been a vegetarian for uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</TIMEX> now my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> has been one for oh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">just over a year</TIMEX> now and uh so
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		do you feel that it has improved the way you feel
 	
 	
 		definitely and it it makes you more aware of what you're eating because you you have to be i mean you you  i think you
 	
 	
 		you think
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you you balance the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> uh you know you're more aware of what nutrient you know value each thing has and minerals and you're just more aware of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> for energy for energy sake
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		um-hum i always thought it would be be hard to figure out what to eat if you were a vegetarian how how
 	
 	
 		well that's just it you you do have to figure it out and and you know to get <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and things and when i was a vegan it's you know you have to consider calcium and iron and things like that you you're not even getting through your milk products your egg products
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		because you don't eat any of those things
 	
 	
 		if you don't eat any of those but actually you can get everything you need through <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetables</ENAMEX> i mean there are  there are there are you actually you can get more calcium through
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">leafy</ENAMEX> green <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetables</ENAMEX> than you can get through <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk products</ENAMEX> a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> don't know that well the thing is that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk</ENAMEX> products our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> don't uh
 	
 	
 		is that right
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		don't uh the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the lactose</TIMEX> that kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk</ENAMEX> it doesn't our we we tend to uh what's it called we don't synthesize the the calcium the same way
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		we throw more of it off our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> out other words
 	
 	
 		yeah we we slough some of it we we send we send some of it out because it our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> doesn't accept some of it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so we're not utilizing we're when it when it gets rid of some of that um that we can't use it get rids it gets rid of some of the calcium
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		whereas we eat say broccoli you utilize all of it you utilize your your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> accepts all of the broccoli
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		all that's in it
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so it's like it's like say a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> using vitamins as opposed to uh vitamin supplements as opposed to eating regular food
 	
 	
 		why
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> just doesn't accept vitamins and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">minerals</ENAMEX> in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the vitamins</TIMEX> in
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> supplements that it does in regular food you know so but we both we both feel much healthier much healthier and i couldn't consider going back to eating
 	
 	
 		that's interesting
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		after you have been on this
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah well now i changed for ethical reasons and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		has changed he feels more ethically about it but he
 		he in the beginning began for health reasons
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but um
 		now he he feels like i do that
 		he looks at the things that he eats and he realizes what they are before he eats them and he you know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		he thinks more about them then
 	
 	
 		yeah plus he eats we both think more about i thought more of about it as far as what it was i was eating
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know as far as a living <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">creature</ENAMEX> and now we both think a lot of well what is it we're eating in relation to what it's going to give to our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> too so
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		um-hum so you kind of have a combination
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh</ENAMEX> now see we i live in a farming community
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so of course we have a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> and that type of thing raised in our area
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well we do too i mean i was raised in um we're in cattle <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> here buy <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a half</NUMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cow</ENAMEX> and put it in their freezer you know and that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		um-hum oh yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		that's the way i and i believe you me it wasn't easy to give up to give up a hamburger that that was one of my favorite <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> was was a was a good steak or a hamburger but
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		
 
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know i suppose if you really believe in something it's
 		you you adjust your life because your mind you your you inside yourself you just it's not right
 	
 	
 		you get adjusted to the taste
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so but um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		so you would have a little more trouble when you were looking for a dining <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">area</ENAMEX> than what most
 	
 	
 		oh yes
 	
 	
 		most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> would
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		now we wouldn't have that problem  because we're not vegetarians
 	
 	
 		so what do you look for when you
 	
 	
 		uh i think the main thing that i look for is uh cleanliness
 		uh you know the in the appearance of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that work there and the uh quality of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> that they serve
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		do you normally when you're traveling do you look for places that's established that that you've been to before or are you willing to try new places
 	
 	
 		if
 		oh we try new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">places</ENAMEX> but when we a lot of times we do eat where we know
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah like a chain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX> or something
 	
 	
 		what
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		what the quality because a lot of them are the same no matter where you stop
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh we do do that a lot
 		and i guess i'm getting old older  also i like to be served  i like to sit down and have my uh
 		order taken
 	
 	
 		as opposed to like a cafeteria kind of
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		situation yeah
 	
 	
 		so i suppose you'd say i well i i don't know whether it's age or what it is but i have
 	
 	
 		well no i don't think so i think it's just your because i i prefer to be waited on too i just if you're going to go out to eat why not have the whole service you know why why not get the whole
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		i guess because we don't go out that much i feel like it's a treat
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		you should feel have a treat and i like the light meals not all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> have light <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meals</ENAMEX> on their menu
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know and i
 	
 	
 		oh light menu you mean like cooked light or
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh L I T E</ENAMEX> like uh uh things that aren't as heavy a meal
 	
 	
 		oh i see uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it
 		that you get more uh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX> and
 		maybe cottage <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cheese</ENAMEX> or a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chicken</ENAMEX> breast or things that aren't as uh
 		they're not breaded and they're not fried and they're not
 	
 	
 		not a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gravy</ENAMEX> and things like that you know i i like those too i like those too because uh some seems like sometimes it's
 	
 	
 		yeah uh but not all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you order a meal you order their dinner <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meal</ENAMEX> and it's like they're trying to find out how much you can eat or or
 	
 	
 		i know it's too much yes
 	
 	
 		
 
 		or or like evidently <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> go in there and they're not satisfied that they'd been given enough and they complain and maybe they're afraid that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are going to complain or something i
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		i don't know what it is but
 		now for instance we we had a Scout dinner <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">last night</TIMEX> we went to and it's it's they
 		uh well they'll serve you at your seat and usually usually the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salad</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX> is included so you have to get up for that but
 		they have so much food
 		that you not matter how hard you try to restrain yourself you end up eating
 		much more than you need
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		and i think that's a shame i mean i must admit sometimes i do like a buffet but uh but i think that they just tend to make you you say oh well i've have got all i can eat or or you know it's one of these situations where
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		nobody's going to restrain what you eat the amount that you eat and i think that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that we just tend to eat overeat yeah
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah you can eat as much as you want and you like the food you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh a lot of times the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> like uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Haas</ENAMEX>'s carry a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bread</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX> that is just out of this world  and you know you and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">soup</ENAMEX> and uh they just and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetables</ENAMEX> and they they just
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i don't know that you i know i always overeat no matter i go with good intentions
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but i somehow along the way when i come back to my seat i have too much  and i eat it  because it's so good
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well at least it's <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX> and stuff there maybe it's not too bad
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 		and i like reasonable prices of course too i don't like to
 		you know go to anything that's real expensive
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i think that's a waste of my money
 	
 	
 		just for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> it does seem like it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		but uh we like uh we do like international food so we tend to i like cooking we like <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> and uh i love <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> food and
 	
 	
 		so
 		do you
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX>
 		we've got a good <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX> in town i i really like eating there and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and you don't get stuffed on their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> it seems
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know you can eat a whole big plate of their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> and
 		you really don't feel like you've eaten too much
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you're full you know you're satisfied
 		but you don't feel stuffed and miserable
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah that's one thing that i wish we had more of uh because where we're from it's it's pretty limited and it's most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> are
 		oh they tend to be you know <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> style food and we don't have too many where you have to go all the way to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		um
 	
 	
 		and so really is a treat because uh you know we don't make a trip <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixty</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five eighty</TIMEX> you know sixty <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">five to eighty miles</NUMEX> depending how far in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> it is
 	
 	
 		so yeah
 		yeah
