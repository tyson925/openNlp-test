 
     		
 	
 		
  
 		okay
 		how do you feel about them
 	
 	
 		well i keep trying to get away from them
 		i used to use a lot of credit cards i guess for a while i would use you know a variety of the the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Visa</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MasterCard</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> but
 		i think i i impulse buy too much with them or i buy things you know i see it on sale and i think oh it's on sale i have to get it
 		and i really don't need it or i really haven't budgeted for it so um <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last couple of years</TIMEX> i really have tried not to use them at all what about you
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well we have this philosophy we use it when we go off somewhere
 		but we pay for it as soon as we come back you know as soon as we get our bills we pay it off and we only have one we tore all the rest of them up
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		okay
 	
 	
 		because i don't like credit cards for one thing you know i mean they're okay i guess if you're on a trip or something you don't have to take a whole bunch of you know cash with you but i don't like using
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		right
 	
 	
 		because i've seen too many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that used them and ended up bankrupt or on chapter thirteen and stuff like that because they have this weird opinion that if you use that card you don't have to pay for it
 	
 	
 		hum
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		that's true if if it's on the credit card it doesn't seem like it's money out of your pocket and sometimes you may think well i don't have the money so you use the credit card it's like fake money or something
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah and it gives you a sense um a false sense of security or something it seems like because you say oh well i don't have to pay for it now but you're going to have to pay for it and it seems like
 	
 	
 		yeah you think well i don't have it now but payday will come and then i'll have the money but that's probably paying for things that were still owed from last time  yes
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		right are you married
 		oh okay well i know that a lot of young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> you know i it took me a long time to
 		get it through my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>'s head i mean that was her goal you know uh got to have a credit card but now that she has one she's only used it one time but she wanted to establish some credit
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but i think it finally sunk in you know because she saw some of the other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and just like she heard them say you know well i used a credit card
 		and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>'s sister is the world's worst at oh well i'll just use the credit cards and she has all of her credit cards up to the limit
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		you know and i'm i'm thinking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>  wake up and smell the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">roses</ENAMEX> before they come and get you but
 	
 	
 		right besides the fact that how much interest you pay and then this
 	
 	
 		right and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> don't see that either
 	
 	
 		yeah this thing that you thought you got on sale by the time you get done paying with that with all the finance charges because you pay it off over a long period of time you've spent a heck of a lot of money on that thing
 	
 	
 		right the only one that we we have that we kept was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Discover</ENAMEX> card
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and it pays you to use it i mean if you pay your bill off right away if you don't ever have to pay any interest on it because they give you a certain amount every time that you use it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and you make that money as long as you don't ever have to pay them any uh interest now it's and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> say well you know i'm making money by using this credit card but they don't realize that if they
 		i mean it only takes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time for you to use it and not pay the interest i mean you have to pay the interest not pay it right off
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		that's going to take up what you would have made
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		so that's the only reason that we kept that we debated for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a long time</TIMEX> plus they don't have that um
 		charge on it you know like yeah right they don't have one of those
 	
 	
 		service charge you mean <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yearly</TIMEX> fee yeah
 	
 	
 		so it we decided that was it you know and i mean everybody calls us and wants to give us a credit card we have we could have credit cards running out our ears
 	
 	
 		oh you get that stuff in the mail all the time
 	
 	
 		yes yes and then i'll i'll have just like uh department <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> they'll call me up you know and i'll say look i don't want the credit card well we're just going to send it to you you know you don't have to ever use it if you don't want to they'll send me any credit card i tear it up
 	
 	
 		what i really hate in the mail is like for the credit cards that i do have still that they send you these things that look like checks
 	
 	
 		i just can't see it
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and they say hey you know <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">two thousand dollars</NUMEX> you know free to you kind of thing you know all you got to do is go cash those things and you've got a short term loan
 		i hate it  i can't believe they have the nerve to do that
 	
 	
 		i know it and you know what
 		what's really bad about those though is just like young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> if they don't you know we take the time to you know help my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> she's in college
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but it this is her first credit card thing well when she got her <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> one she was so excited it was unreal look at this they sent me this money you know
 		so then when i explained to her look you have to pay this back and they are going to charge you interest and stuff of course she ter tore it up but a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> would not take the time
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know and they wouldn't even think of it or their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> may not be as close as my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> and i are
 		and um you know they may not even discuss it they go out and cash that check thinking that you know they've got something maybe they've won something you know somebody sent them something free and go out and spend it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and um it's just unreal i mean i don't like credit cards i wish that they would come up with some other way to you know the only way you could use them is if you were
 		like on vacation they would let you use it maybe once a year you know i mean of course i guess some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> go out and spend their whole entire limit on it like that at that time but um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i have seen so many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and i have a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> right now she just got off of thirteen
 		she got uh i can't remember what she called it it's some kind of maybe it's sure or something like that it's something it's some weird name of a credit card and she is charging out of her mind already and i'm going you just got off
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		that's how you got on to it to start with you know what is the matter with this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>  but um it seems like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> just you know they just think well i can just have anything i want
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i just don't see it like that of course i always see pay the bills <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> and whatever's leftover that's what you have but um maybe a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> don't see it like that but i can't stand owing
 		i mean i cannot hardly tolerate to owe something like you know i guess it's just because i've been brought up like that
 		but um i could not charge to the limit and knowing that i was going to have to pay this thing out for ever and maybe suffer from having to pay out
 		but that's just the way i feel about it
 	
 	
 		yeah i think it's it's somewhat a um symptom of our
 		me generation and that we think we need all these things and i think my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> always
 		you know did without or saved up to you know buy things and we consider that so many of these things we just have to have
 		you know like when i <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> got my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> and i was setting it up i did try to economize some but
 		you know i was just like well i have to have it all furnished and i have to have all of my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen</ENAMEX> setup and you don't you know do without too much and
 		you know that's how i got started kind of with setting up a household all up you know it kind of like in the short amount of time
 		you know you just have to have these things just you know have them at home have to have them at my own place and that's you know a big expenditure to start um
 		buying all these things that you think or or have to have and actually they're kind of luxuries or you should save up slowly and keep buying them and not just rush out and furnish the whole place you know going in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> big swoop save up and then buy it
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but we're not into that we're into like have to have it all now
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i guess it is like that though because it seems like more and more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are like that
 		but um i guess it's because i'm older i mean i'm not real old but i am older and um you know i didn't feel like that i didn't feel like i had to have everything i guess it was because
 		well i had everything when i was at home but i i don't know why i didn't
 	
 	
 		well we're geared to that we're like okay like i want a living room <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">set</ENAMEX> and instead of sitting back and and
 		going okay well it's going to cost <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">maybe a thousand dollars two thousand dollars</NUMEX> and i'll save for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</TIMEX> people go oh well i'll just go buy it put it on credit and i'll pay it off
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> aren't tuned in to like saving for it and then buying it they just put it on a charge card put it on account and then pay off the bill because they want it now it's always have to have it now
 	
 	
 		hm
 		yeah um well it didn't hurt you did it to i mean you didn't go out and charge a whole bunch and lose everything did you
 	
 	
 		no no but i have had some times when i've had some pretty good balances on there and uh you know i finally
 		you know paid them all off and thought this is you know kind of nonsense so we don't uh have big balances on them at all now we're we're you know we i use it occasionally but i pay it right off we're
 	
 	
 		yeah well you learned then right
 	
 	
 		yeah you learn the you know the hard way you hate paying all that interest and i've never been one to itemize on my income tax and never had
 		enough to itemize and so it's just a big chunk of money and you realize that you're not buying anything on sale your paying so much more for that item
 		because you've got finance charge and the cost of having that card <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every year</TIMEX> which is what <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">forty dollars</NUMEX> sometimes just to have the card
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that's a lot of money that you went to buy this item
 	
 	
 		um-hum so then
 	
 	
 		and then you never feel like you've got anything to to put into savings or anything you're always just paying bills paying bills
 		you know you don't feel that you have any extra to save and i hate i hate living paycheck to paycheck i like to have a little there you know that i can save so i can feel that you know if something comes up i've got the money to pay for it
 	
 	
 		right
