 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so how do you feel about the metric system
 	
 	
 		oh i like it i i i have a foreign actually i have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">automobile</ENAMEX> and i i i find the uh i find the the nondecimal system with all the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">halves</NUMEX> and quarters i was trying to build a shed
 		and they give you these measurements like <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">forty two</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> eighths inches
 		and we had to go a little less and trying to figure what's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than three</NUMEX> eighths uh
 	
 	
 		yeah and it's i forget how many millimeters so you used the metric
 	
 	
 		well no what we did was wind up using and you just go you just go down and and you get out the the so many inches and and we just marked a little bit less than that
 		uh which is somewhat awkward but had it been millimeters you could have done i think what's interesting the way engineering <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> do is they they in essence have gotten around it by by listing uh decimal inches
 	
 	
 		uh yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		do you are you involved in any engineering drawing stuff that
 	
 	
 		uh yeah yeah uh i work in metal fab
 		and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">tenths of inches</NUMEX> are are normal and
 		you know metric you know it is broken up in you know the inch is broken up and has been for quite some time for in <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">tenths hundredths thousandths ten thousandths of an inch</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		well have have you do you are you involved in any other uh metric type things like
 	
 	
 		yes i am i i have a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Suzuki motorcycle</ENAMEX>
 		and
 		and i've had motorcycles <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">motorcycles</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> and the metric system comes easy to me
 	
 	
 		i think it's interesting you went you know when you you go out there and you're looking for a wrench and you want the next size larger i've got i inherited some some stuff like fifteen <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">seconds</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		but my
 		right
 	
 	
 		well now that one's fairly easy because that's probably slightly under <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">half an inch</NUMEX> but some of them like like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty seven</TIMEX> and and there are some <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">seconds</TIMEX> and some of the things that that uh don't translate
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah transfer yeah to go from from eighths to sixteenths to uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">seconds</TIMEX> and remember where it falls it
 	
 	
 		yeah and and you've got to go over there and try it and i suppose you know i need a larger one i need a smaller one i mean obviously you can look at it and say well
 		anyway i think the other thing that's interesting is that a lot of our stuff is already changed that we haven't i don't know do you do you drink adult beverages
 	
 	
 		yeah i drink beer
 	
 	
 		well that have you noticed that um that a lot of the um a lot of
 	
 	
 		yeah <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">whiskey</ENAMEX> is in liters
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		and and the next yeah point <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven five</NUMEX> liters and then liters and then <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> point <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven five</NUMEX> liters yeah
 	
 	
 		it's like a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX> like fifths of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">whiskey</ENAMEX> i thought was always kind of strange
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		what's a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX> of whiskey
 	
 	
 		yeah i i always wondered about that myself
 	
 	
 		
 
 		it was a marketing ploy
 	
 	
 		and and they had quarts at the same time though
 	
 	
 		yeah but the idea was is that by with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> fifths um they could uh they could uh they could sell <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> and and
 		um it was  simply a ploy to to get <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		to buy to buy more for it's uh i find that interesting but it's like you know the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the the</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">soda</ENAMEX> and this kind of things coming in
 	
 	
 		it's
 		liters
 	
 	
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">liter</ENAMEX> bottles and um i i think it's kind of generational although i must admit that that i am not
 		i can i'm not conversant in saying you know that's <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">three centimeters</NUMEX> away i mean or or or
 	
 	
 		yeah it it's
 		like i say i work in a machine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX> and uh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">everything's</ENAMEX> still inches
 	
 	
 		yeah and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">everything's</ENAMEX> still fractions of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">inches</NUMEX> or parts or <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">tenths</NUMEX> or thousandths or or
 	
 	
 		yeah it's it's hard to think though
 	
 	
 		yes it is a mental thing it is a conversion thing
 	
 	
 		it's like a mill you know we we do uh um well we use a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mill</ENAMEX> bond wire or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> point <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mill</ENAMEX> conductive bond wire on on semiconductor devices
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and well what's a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mill</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		but what really annoys me is the way we in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> have been converting to metric
 		we have a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eighty nine</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chevy</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Blazer</ENAMEX> and before that we had a Horizon uh you know <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Plymouth Horizon</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and
 		both of
 		them were a mismatch of both
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX> and metric
 	
 	
 		don't you find that interesting uh that they that  that they're doing that uh in any field for how why why why pieces could you could you get any connection on which was metric and which wasn't
 	
 	
 		uh okay the engine itself was mostly metric
 		because it came from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		and the starter was
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bosch American</ENAMEX> so
 	
 	
 		the bolts were were <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> were were <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> then
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		it was it was annoying <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one one half</NUMEX> of the starter was you know three bolts on the starter and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of them were
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX> and one of them was metric
 	
 	
 		now that's strange
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		you go from the uh water pump up to the
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">radiator</ENAMEX> and on the
 		water pump
 		it was all metric and
 		and on
 		you know the factory fittings you know the factory uh
 	
 	
 		yeah uh-huh
 	
 	
 		screw lock uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> radiator hose clamps
 	
 	
 		essentially they do that though because if if you look at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Motors</ENAMEX> the size and and and of course <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> if they all went if they all went metric but in a sense um
 		you know it's like when you a measurement though when when you put uh you know <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> point <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">three two inches</NUMEX> when when you're milling something
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh you simply set your uh equipment or or you measure or you got your calipers there and and you measure you know you  it to see if it's accurate and
 	
 	
 		right it's it's not a problem either way like i said my only complaint is where they mixed them on the same car
 	
 	
 		and
 		no
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and you go to look at it and you don't know which set to reach in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> or metric
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and
 		and you're never quite sure well is that a metric bolt
 	
 	
 		you get you a pair of metric pliers right  and you beat on it and a metric hammer
 	
 	
 		right right
 		it it can be annoying and my other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern concern</ENAMEX> is
 		is the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> going to force us to go
 	
 	
 		oh i think i don't think so i i think that that uh i think they've now just taken the attitude that well if it happens if it because it there a lot of things that that uh um like sports you know it's <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a hundred meter</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh absolutely
 	
 	
 		and uh uh but automobile races if it i don't think they'd ever it's still going to be the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Indianapolis Five Hundred</ENAMEX> they're not going to
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah they're not going to change that to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">meters</NUMEX> it will always be
 	
 	
 		yeah and and it i i don't think it i don't you know i don't think i don't think it's particularly bothersome because in reality uh you it's like troy <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">ounces</NUMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">ounces</NUMEX> of gold how many <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">ounces</NUMEX> of gold
 		you know i was trying i was trying to figure up <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX> content on something it had has uh gold plated uh header
 	
 	
 		<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">twelve</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		and and they're trying to think of what's a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Troy</ENAMEX> ounce
 	
 	
 		yeah there's <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">twelve troy ounces</NUMEX> to the pound
 	
 	
 		yeah now that makes you know
 	
 	
 		yeah and
 		and is that going to change too
 	
 	
 		well i mean and and then there's a metric ton and then there's a ton but what's a metric ton
 	
 	
 		uh see i don't remember i i read it
 	
 	
 		i don't know
 	
 	
 		and are we still going to maintain drams for perfume
 	
 	
 		yeah and and then but then the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX> and and some of these other things and and the chemistry in those kinds of areas milliliter
 	
 	
 		it's all metric all ready
 	
 	
 		yeah and and so um but but when you go to order a drink um you know well you say they they i don't know it's uh
 	
 	
 		and what will a shot be will a shot be an ounce
 	
 	
 		i don't know and and but you know when you go to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX> and and you're trying to figure you know well this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">box</ENAMEX> is is uh is is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">twelve ounces</NUMEX> and and this one's uh uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> pounds um and you
 	
 	
 		and the other one's
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> point one keys and and you're you're lost
 	
 	
 		that's right
 		and and
 		i don't know i i think that i i think i think the Federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> is going to more or less leave it alone i think they've got i think there are more pressing problems
 	
 	
 		oh yeah the economy uh what i was thinking about is an economical issue concerning it uh
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		a machinist has a huge number of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">dollars</NUMEX> invested in tooling
 		personal tools to be able to do his job
 	
 	
 		yeah but but are are the tools that uh if you're cutting are you talking about cutting equipment or tools for that for set up
 	
 	
 		uh tools for set up and for measurement
 		uh you got to have
 		a one
 		tenth indicator it's a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">hundred dollars</NUMEX>
 		uh <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">five tenths</NUMEX> indicator uh usually <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two one tenth</NUMEX> indicators at a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">hundred dollars</NUMEX> each uh <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">five tenths</NUMEX> indicator
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about a hundred dollars</NUMEX> you got to have uh <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">six inch</NUMEX>
 		set of calipers at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">anywhere from sixty</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty</TIMEX> dollars you got to have a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixty</TIMEX> dollars uh
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">two inch</NUMEX> micrometer for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixty</TIMEX> dollars a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two to three</NUMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">eighty dollars</NUMEX> a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> for eighty dollars
 	
 	
 		so you've got <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">thousands of dollars</NUMEX> or so i mean you get a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">thousand dollars</NUMEX> worth of tools
 	
 	
 		real fast
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		real real fast edge finders and
 	
 	
 		but i was thinking about though that that when you actually get to the milling equipment though when it starts turning
 	
 	
 		well i know because okay
 		your end <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mills</ENAMEX> will be measured in inches or fractions of inches
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know
 	
 	
 		but when you when you when you simply drilling a hole i mean a real simple thing like gee i need a hole there
 	
 	
 		what size hole
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		as in metric size hole or a or an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> sized hole
 	
 	
 		yeah and and what but the thing is then you've got to with screws and that's the other issue uh the pitch and
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah well and thread
