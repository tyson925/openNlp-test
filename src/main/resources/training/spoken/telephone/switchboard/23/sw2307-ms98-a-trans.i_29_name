 
     		
 	
 		okay well now i'm from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		well actually i'm living in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> i'm not from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> i uh was living in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Texas</ENAMEX> before this uh which is a very dry arid
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		okay
 	
 	
 		well obviously it's kind of a desert area
 	
 	
 		right getting uh close to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> or
 	
 	
 		um-hum real close <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX> anyway
 	
 	
 		all right and no
 		and not the humidity i usually think of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South</ENAMEX> as being very humid
 	
 	
 		well he <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> is and that's since i've moved up here <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">now</TIMEX> so i'm starting to get a little bit of this but
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> is
 	
 	
 		i'll tell you uh considering well okay i've uh mostly throughout my life i've lived in in the smaller parts of of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> and so moving to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> i was a little worried about the traffic
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um
 		the differences in terrain because uh you know <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> is is a lot more hilly than it is where i i was living and i had just bought a new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> and it had uh had standard standard on you know standard and i had never had a standard car before
 	
 	
 		i see
 		oh
 		oh  you have to get used to hills
 	
 	
 		right so i mean i was real worried about you know having a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> and things like that we just had a wonderful winter i mean there was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one or two days of ice the entire winter</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh that's good
 	
 	
 		i mean we had cold weather we had a little bit of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">snow</ENAMEX> here and there but i mean i couldn't have asked for better <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">first year</TIMEX> of getting used to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> at the same time i mean it just worked out great for me
 	
 	
 		oh that's good and what what is uh what is the temperature like down there now
 	
 	
 		oh well <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> it was probably in the eighties um well yeah we've had uh we've had <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several days</TIMEX> in the eighties in fact i'll tell you what last night i came real close to turning on the air conditioning i didn't do it
 	
 	
 		oh that's pretty warm already
 		oh is that right
 	
 	
 		i didn't do it but i came close
 	
 	
 		actually <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> uh um <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about a week ago</TIMEX> at the same time last
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> um we had hit the actually uh nineties for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about four days</TIMEX> which is very unusual for this area <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at this time of year</TIMEX> um what we're having right now is a lot of overcast
 	
 	
 		i would imagine yes
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know a lot of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> with uh drizzle or uh actually we've had a thunderstorm But about this time of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year March</TIMEX> blows a lot of winds here and it's a very windy month
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		um but right now we're in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about the sixties</TIMEX> which is is fairly comfortable
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		well i heard the uh that um <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DC</ENAMEX> has actually got the cherry blossoms blooming so
 	
 	
 		yes we do they peak on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX> so if you have a chance to be here <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX> or somewhere somewhere around there that that's the best time to see them and they don't last too long you know
 	
 	
 		so that's
 		hum well yeah that's i heard that
 	
 	
 		yeah and uh then after after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this month</TIMEX> it'll quickly get get hot you know i mean <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March April May</TIMEX> it has a lot of rain uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX> has quite a bit of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rain</ENAMEX> and uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX> we're hitting in the eighties sometimes even low low nineties uh but we don't really get the bad humidity here until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August</TIMEX> those are our worst months
 	
 	
 		um-hum well that's that's sort of what happens here except uh we may start a little <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> and end a little later but uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right right so is everything in uh bloom down there now is it warm enough i guess all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> are
 	
 	
 		yeah they've been they've actually been going at it for a good you know <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four weeks</TIMEX> now i would think um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know in fact it's kind of funny uh you know you're watching the newscast i don't know about way up they are up there but the weather cast down here one of the things that they like to do is to tell you what's all in the air you know the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fungus</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> yeah well
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh right
 		air quality index yeah
 	
 	
 		but mostly it's you know allergy type index and it's been like like i said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about four weeks</TIMEX> now that uh they've had um
 		multiple pages of things and you know of of names of things in the air and uh you know so that's a real good sign that that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> are in bloom and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> are in bloom and stuff like that
 	
 	
 		oh
 		right
 		is that like a pollen sort of a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pollen</ENAMEX> count yeah yeah well we're just starting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">now</TIMEX> like i said the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cherry blossoms</ENAMEX> are out forsythias are out uh no tulips yet so we're probably <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few weeks</TIMEX> behind
 	
 	
 		pollen count yeah exactly
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh you know down uh that area being that south you know and uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		that lasts everything's in bloom you know everything's green here till <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about October</TIMEX> and then we lose it all
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh i always wondered about the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South</ENAMEX> i figured that there couldn't be too many <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> that that <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> were were bare because it's it's hot most of the time
 	
 	
 		well it's it's um it depends on what part of the south i think the farther east you go you know from from here on east uh you do have a a limited
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		winter um now south of here uh like in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Houston</ENAMEX> i did even though i said i lived mostly in the small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> i lived a short time in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Houston</ENAMEX> it was winter
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and you know the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">coldest day</TIMEX> we got down there was like in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the sixties</TIMEX> you know when it got down in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the sixties</TIMEX> you were cold down there
 	
 	
 		i see
 		oh okay here it's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixties</TIMEX> and we're celebrating okay so there's that's the difference i remember being in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Louisiana</ENAMEX> a few times and and it was uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah that
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i think it was in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December one time</TIMEX> and it was probably in the fifties and rainy kind of weather but in the fifties and i was shocked
 		to see <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> all bundled up with scarves and hats as though  it were you know in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the twenties</TIMEX> because here in the fifties <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have sweaters so you know i guess it's what you become acclimated  to yes
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		oh yes it's a big difference i have a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> is from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kansas City</ENAMEX> and uh he has lived down here for like <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eleven</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> but he refuses
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		to get to to where everybody else is i mean he will not wear long sleeve shirts he will not wear you know jackets and things like that i mean he's the only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> i know
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		that in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> degree weather still has a short sleeve shirt on you know um but it you know it's still not cold cold here compared to what he's used to so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah yes
 		right right so uh yeah i i i like it better here i'm i'm uh formerly a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pennsylvanian</ENAMEX> and i have to say that i enjoy it
 		that much better here a lot more sunshine and a lot less cold you know but i don't know about ever going that far south to live you know i guess you after a while whatever you get used to what you enjoy that's right
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		well i think that's true yeah
 		although there's you know there's you don't ever want to get
 		too much different to what i mean uh i grew up with a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> around and then i lived out like i said in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Texas</ENAMEX> where it's desert and there's not a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> and that's the main reason i moved up here was that i did not i mean i hated
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		right
 	
 	
 		seeing you know no trees i mean it's just you could stand on a rooftop and see for miles and miles
 	
 	
 		yeah i can understand that sure yeah i mean no i wouldn't want to i wouldn't want to uh go to a desert type of area either you know you get once you're in greenery you get spoiled by that you know
 	
 	
 		well now that's that's not necessarily true there are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that are born out there that can't stand it here
 	
 	
 		no
 		oh is that right
 	
 	
 		they they feel claustrophobic around <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> i thought that was hilarious when i first heard it but i mean i heard it from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> so it's got to be somewhat true i mean
 	
 	
 		ah that's interesting
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah yeah so i guess that once they're used to the wide open spaces huh that that yeah that that's interesting so
 	
 	
 		exactly
 		yeah i see i wouldn't have thought from the beginning but i've talked to so many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> about it that it makes sense now i guess
 	
 	
 		yeah i think i'll take the area with <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> huh yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		hum i agree i agree of course i wouldn't mind having an area with ocean but we won't get involved in that either
 	
 	
 		right  why am i too nice yeah that is pretty good oh but anyway well i that's that's about all you know i have right here on on this area so
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah that sounds good
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		okay well
 	
 	
 		okay well nice talking to you alright well bye bye
 	
 	
 		it was yeah nice talking to you too bye-bye
