 
     		
 	
 		
 
 		okay  i was thinking about camping and different i <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>'s ideas about it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		we've even seen <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with these <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">campers</ENAMEX> and they got the big old antennas up so they can watch their TV when they're going but that's not
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right or the satellite dish
 	
 	
 		yeah  a satellite dish
 	
 	
 		on top of those recreational <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicles</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh golly that's not the kind we do do you go camping
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah we have a little bit and we've just gotten <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of those little tents  that we throw out on the ground and that's what we camp in so we kind of rough it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well so do we in fact when we <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> got married we would try to take these trips to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minnesota</ENAMEX> to see his family
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and we didn't have a tent or any camping supplies so we'd sleep on those picnic tables at roadside parks i mean i know it's dangerous i wouldn't do it now but we did
 	
 	
 		oh no
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time we went to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yellowstone</ENAMEX> and we were doing the same thing we couldn't find a place to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camp</ENAMEX> and so we were
 		on top of a picnic table with our our sleeping bags i guess
 		and this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ranger</ENAMEX> comes up with this light shines it on us and said that we're just bear bait out there we had our <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> you know
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and told us to get inside our car
 	
 	
 		gosh bear bait
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bear</ENAMEX> bait
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that would make me nervous
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		have you done any camping around here
 	
 	
 		yeah we've got some land at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Holly Lake</ENAMEX> outside of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tyler</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and go up there fairly often
 		sometimes we get a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> together to do it
 	
 	
 		yeah that sounds fun
 	
 	
 		and we've done things like when when it's kind of cold we take extension cords and we've all brought heaters in our tents
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and in the summer same thing we get our extension cords running from all these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tents</ENAMEX> but we've got the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fans</ENAMEX> going
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		so we're not roughing it too much and we have taken TVs out there for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and they've got their electrical hookups
 		so it's not so bad
 	
 	
 		yeah do you go on long like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a week</TIMEX> at a time or just <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekends</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		i think the longest we've stayed out there is like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five days</TIMEX> and they even they had a library at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time out there
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so that's really not roughing it so much but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 		we have gone on trips we've bathed in streams
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		that's kind of different
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i like the campgrounds that have a nice shower
 	
 	
 		and a pool to go to that would be nice
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah we've uh we  camped at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">DeGray State Park</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arkansas</ENAMEX>
 		in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fall</TIMEX> and there was nobody else hardly around and it was just really nice
 		that time of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> we had taken our electric blanket too just in case it was unbearable but we didn't need it
 	
 	
 		well my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> has even camped at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lake Lavon</ENAMEX> with one of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> he just decided to take the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> out there
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i mean it's not very many miles from our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> at all
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but they had the time of their lives you know
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		had the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> just pulled up right by the tents
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 		it wasn't bad
 	
 	
 		that sounds nice
 	
 	
 		yeah and we've taken our tents though loaded them up in car carrier
 		and decided we were going to tent most of the way and it ended up when it came time for us to pull in for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the night</TIMEX>
 		we'd take a vote and most of the time we decided we wanted to stay in a hotel
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		instead of getting out all that stuff you know
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah it's a lot of work to set up just for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one night</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah then you have to get up <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next day</TIMEX> and move it on
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">huh-uh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but we're set now we've got <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cook stoves</ENAMEX> and we've got our bug light
 		and everybody's got their sleeping bags we got air mattresses we decided that was easier than cots and more comfortable
 	
 	
 		yeah those are nice we have one of those too uh-huh
 	
 	
 		yeah those double ones
 		pretty good we're on our <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> one i think somehow
 	
 	
 		yeah how do you blow yours up
 	
 	
 		we've got an electric pump that hooks into the cigarette lighter
 	
 	
 		oh we we were looking at those in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> last time we went we took our vacuum cleaner with us
 	
 	
 		i didn't know you could do that
 	
 	
 		and yeah you can if you can reverse the nozzle on your vacuum cleaner and it blows air out instead of sucking it in and you can
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		fill them up that way but it something that's smaller would be a lot more convenient
 	
 	
 		no joke  i hope you didn't have a big vacuum cleaner
 	
 	
 		no uh-huh we have a  my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> and i we have a pickup <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">truck</ENAMEX> so there's plenty of room to hold things
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah now we've used a hair dryer before
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but i put it on hot and also melted it
 	
 	
 		oh no
 	
 	
 		i found that you don't do that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i didn't realize it would melt so easily
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		i don't know
 	
 	
 		we take we take our dog <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camping</ENAMEX> she likes
 		to go out and stay in the woods sleep she sleeps in the tent with us
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's fun
 	
 	
 		i don't like it when there's <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes</ENAMEX> so bad
 	
 	
 		oh me either
 	
 	
 		and then <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one night</TIMEX> we were camping and it came just a torrential downpour we had the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steaks</ENAMEX> on the grill
 		these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> were with us and it
 		i mean everything was sopping wet inside the tent it was just that bad you know
 	
 	
 		oh no
 	
 	
 		and we decided we'd just go across the road to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> and see if we could rent anything
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so i got a condo with a jacuzzi and it was wonderful yeah
 	
 	
 		oh boy
 		that was lucky
 	
 	
 		yeah it was
 	
 	
 		we've been lucky we've never really been rained on the few times we've gone
 	
 	
 		it's horrible
 	
 	
 		oh i bet it when we were younger when i was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX> we camped in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX> and
 		we had one of those little pop up tents which is really nice because it kind of gets you off the ground
 		but it seemed like it rained <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every weekend</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about a year the year</TIMEX> we we were really into camping
 	
 	
 		you mean that you put on a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">truck</ENAMEX> or what
 	
 	
 		uh no it's a little trailer you pull behind your <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> and uh
 	
 	
 		oh yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		you know you the lid pops off the little tent comes up the top and
 		it had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> double beds in it
 	
 	
 		how many <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX> have you been doing these calls
 	
 	
 		oh since the beginning
 		i guess it's been <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two or three weeks</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		i think this must be into my <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">third week</TIMEX> too
 		so do you work for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh well i work as a temporary in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Speech Lab</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		in a speech lab
 	
 	
 		uh-huh where they're doing this program
 		the voice recognition program
 	
 	
 		and what exactly are they going to do
 	
 	
 		oh they turn them over to somebody and they're going to
 		i guess they're going to try to teach computers how to recognize voices and search for specific words and stuff
 	
 	
 		so any voice no matter what the
 		speech pattern or the dialect or anything
 	
 	
 		right yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 		hum
 		i wonder if these are going to be speaking
 		the computers
 	
 	
 		i don't know
 		i type up the tapes of what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> talked about
 	
 	
 		oh that's kind of neat
 	
 	
 		yeah it's sort of interesting
 	
 	
 		do you put all the uh-hums in here on everything too
 	
 	
 		uh-huh everything like that all the little stutters and everything
 	
 	
 		what do you write for stutter
 		duh duh
 	
 	
 		oh like if they say i i we just type it in like that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		well i guess that's it for camping huh
 	
 	
 		i guess so unless you want to talk about stakes what size stakes to put in
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you need <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">metal</ENAMEX> instead of plastic
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and you make sure that you keep up with them for the next time we got <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of those kind that have got the
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		oh what is it
 		they're plastic and they've got the elastic on the inside of the poles and you just put them together and it's a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dome</ENAMEX> tent
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh that's what we have too yeah that's what ours is
 	
 	
 		that's good isn't it
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah they pop up pretty fast
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		but
 	
 	
 		have you ever camped on sand
 	
 	
 		um no
 	
 	
 		that can be a mess we camped at the beach <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time and that was sort of miserable
 		you just couldn't everywhere you went there was sand you couldn't even when you're eating it it was in your bed
 	
 	
 		i've done it in a shelter
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it was in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Padre Island</ENAMEX> and in a truck  of course not but not in a tent
