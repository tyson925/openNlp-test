 
     		
 	
 		yeah <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">auto</ENAMEX> repair tends to be a a topic that a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> don't uh don't like i guess because it's usually expensive and uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> end up
 		not pleased with the job sometimes or not pleased with what they had to pay for it so uh i guess it's kind of a sour <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grapes</ENAMEX> type topic i just recently had um
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		put a set of brakes on my little <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Blazer</ENAMEX> that we have and fortunately i i could do most of the work myself but uh this last time that i
 		got into it i got about halfway into it and started feeling a little bad i kind of fluish type and said what a time for this to set in i got the wheel off i got these brake pads off i got car jacked up and
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		need the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next day</TIMEX> type deal so
 	
 	
 		get sick with the flu
 	
 	
 		yeah so uh i continued on and just decided to do part of what i had intended to do when i got inside there which means that when i just get around to doing the rest of it i got to take all of that back off again and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-oh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh start over so uh with little things like that it's it's still a lot cheaper uh that particular for that particular <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model car</ENAMEX> runs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred</NUMEX> and fifty dollars
 	
 	
 		wow are these disc brakes
 	
 	
 		yeah just the front little disc pads but uh while you're in there you usually uh pull the rotor and and uh turn  it down and
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		put the uh grease the bearings up since it's been a while since they'd been done and
 	
 	
 		well i have <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Maxima</ENAMEX> and i had the rear brakes on those
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		redone but i guess auto repairs are cheaper around here i think it was around eighty <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">five dollars</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah the rear brakes just doing the just putting the brake pads in wouldn't be too expensive but it's when while you're in the front that you usually go ahead and pull those
 	
 	
 		is expensive uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that rotor off and repack the bearings and you know that's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty five</TIMEX> dollars and the rotors another <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty five</TIMEX> dollars and then the brake pads are eighty or something the labor and parts and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i just go buy the things for for uh about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> bucks and put them on myself
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but uh it's a bit of a bit of a pain and you have to schedule it you know get around to find a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekend</TIMEX> you can do it and all but still for the for the savings it uh works out usually
 	
 	
 		you're very fortunate
 		well i ran into a problem with my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> uh course we have a little colder weather up here and i had set the emergency brake after we'd had a freezing rain apparently
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and there's some kind of a boot that had had come off the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> so the emergency brake froze on
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and my
 		uh brakes were on all the time i drove to work <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one morning</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> bet that got warm
 	
 	
 		it got warm it was pretty smelly by the time we got there which is not too far a drive but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that that was the reason i had to replace mine
 	
 	
 		yeah that'll do it it'll cook the whole whole insides there
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		hum i don't know what the
 		what the solution for that would have been you would have thought they would have put all the parts pertaining to that near the brake so if they did get hot they'd unfreeze
 	
 	
 		you would hope so but
 	
 	
 		that would be nice if uh all that was
 		huh that's interesting
 		yeah i'm glad we don't have that problem too often down here i've heard a lot of horror stories about <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that
 		go down a straight road long enough and the and the wheel wells ice up enough inside where you get ready to make a turn and and surprise you can't turn and you can't stop in a hurry and no i'll stay down here in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South</ENAMEX> that's
 	
 	
 		that you can't turn
 		that's right
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it's a little bit different
 	
 	
 		i've seen your spaghetti <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridges</ENAMEX> though when i wouldn't want to go over them
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true
 		that's true
 		well i guess the only other uh things that i like to do you know the oil changes and things that are not worth paying for at least in my neck of the woods so
 		we do that kind of maintenance and
 	
 	
 		you do that yourself
 	
 	
 		yeah do the oil change oil and filter and air filters and
 		spark plugs and the like can't do much in the way of actual tune up now that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> now that computers taken over that control
 	
 	
 		oh you're
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		um it costs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about a hundred</NUMEX> and something to get the small module that reads that and
 	
 	
 		i've thought about taking a course just so i could change my own <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX>  but and that would help a little bit but i haven't done it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well i'll tell you some of the horror stories that the the male <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populace</ENAMEX> have done to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> i i recall a a uh
 		coed when i was in college some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> got together and decided to tell this poor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> the way to change her oil was to uh they showed her where to take it out and she did that successfully and then showed her how to
 		uh put it back in but on putting it back in they had her put in they had her put in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all four or five</NUMEX> quarts of this oil with an eyedropper down the dip stick
 	
 	
 		oh no
 	
 	
 		and she did it oh and it was just
 	
 	
 		oh
 		that's crazy
 	
 	
 		that was mean
 	
 	
 		that is mean
 	
 	
 		yep
 		so i guess it it is to your advantage to either not have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> like that or take a little course in
 	
 	
 		or take it to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pit</ENAMEX>  and let them let somebody else do it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah those have really cropped up <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> of late but uh
 	
 	
 		they have but i really hate paying <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twenty two ninety five</NUMEX> for an oil change
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah that's
 	
 	
 		when i know what the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> costs
 	
 	
 		that's true i usually try to catch the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">eighty cents</NUMEX> or so and
 	
 	
 		right uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh stack up on a case of that and  grab the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> dollars filters  when they're on sale and wait for a good weather and go out there course getting rid of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> is getting harder these days
 	
 	
 		right
 		uh
 		well
 	
 	
 		end up having to take it somewhere
 	
 	
 		right some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stations</ENAMEX> around here will take it
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i think maybe they have to accept it
 	
 	
 		well they get a little money for it i mean they they pay they sell it so they should be you know unless it's a hassle or a labor
 	
 	
 		recycle it
 	
 	
 		in you know just dealing with the customer maybe that's there only reason why they don't it'd seem like they'd just put a little barrel out there and say it pour here and go on  we'll take your money
 	
 	
 		that's right um  we were down in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> right after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> and on the way back we stopped in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Louisiana</ENAMEX> to visit my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX>
 		and we were driving my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toyota</ENAMEX> pick up truck well we made a quick little stop when we got to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baton Rouge</ENAMEX> and he came came back out
 		and the car the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">truck</ENAMEX> wouldn't stop i mean it wouldn't start
 		so gave it a somebody came along and helped give it a little push and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the next morning</TIMEX> they took it to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garage</ENAMEX> and
 		it was just a small private <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garage</ENAMEX> and he said it was the starter motor proba bly and he was going to take it off and
 		either repair it or replace it or whatever and we got a call in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the middle of the morning</TIMEX> and he said i've got good news and bad news
 		uh the starter motor is fine it would it just had a
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> of bolts that held it in place
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> had been broken off
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and allowed it to shift enough that it wouldn't
 	
 	
 		um-hum wouldn't catch right
 	
 	
 		match just right and the only bad news was my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> would have to go to a
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">garage</ENAMEX> and pick them up pick the bolts up for him
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		so he went to a used car <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garage</ENAMEX> i guess or place and got the bolts and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		had it running for about fifteen dollars i couldn't believe it because the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> could have really stuck us
 	
 	
 		well that's not
 		yeah that's true
 		that's not to bad then
 	
 	
 		no it  was great
 	
 	
 		well i hear my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> are needing me again so i'll
 		go see what they need  and we'll maybe talk to you again
