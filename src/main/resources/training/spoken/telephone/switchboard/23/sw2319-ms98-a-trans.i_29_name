 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh i guess being here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> are you familiar with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rangers</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh somewhat they're not my favorite <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> i am uh somewhat familiar with them
 	
 	
 		okay
 		
 
 		i see what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> do you follow
 	
 	
 		i follow the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Milwaukee Brewers</ENAMEX> mostly
 	
 	
 		i see
 	
 	
 		basically because because that's where i came from and uh grew up following them as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		okay okay that's interesting
 		i guess really though i'm a native <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Texan</ENAMEX> so that really the about the only team i've ever uh followed has been the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rangers</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		and uh uh what do you think <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Milwaukee</ENAMEX>'s going to do this year
 	
 	
 		well uh
 		
 
 		i don't think they're going to challenge for the lead in the east
 	
 	
 		is that right
 	
 	
 		uh they they've got a lot of uh rebuilding to do
 		they traded for a lot of new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX> uh in the off <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX> and it looks like it might help them but uh i think this is going to be a year for pulling together and looking for the future
 	
 	
 		sort of a building <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX> season yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah uh-huh
 	
 	
 		shoot the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rangers</ENAMEX> i don't know what the there's no telling what they'll do they'll probably
 		uh they won't do anything until the all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">star</ENAMEX> break and then uh then they'll pick up a little bit and that seems to be their uh their average pace but
 	
 	
 		well there's been some talk that they're going to trade <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pete Incaviglia</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah uh i heard that but i heard on uh uh the radio <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this morning</TIMEX> that that uh
 		you know old <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bobby Valentine</ENAMEX> said that there was no no uh truth to that but you never can tell
 	
 	
 		okay
 		they might just be fishing to see what they can get for him
 	
 	
 		that's right and i don't know personally i'd like to get rid of him i think he's sort of a showboat and really hadn't produced you know a whole lot but uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i agree they're paying him too much money and uh for for the kind of money they're paying him right now i think it's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> point <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">six million dollars</NUMEX> they can get a pretty good quality outfielder
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah then they're going to have to spend some money and i think build up their pitching <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> uh
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm looking forward to seeing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nolan Ryan</ENAMEX> pitch
 	
 	
 		yeah it would be interesting to see how he does this year
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		i think the rest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> is uh a little weak
 	
 	
 		yeah i heard uh just i guess last night they got beat uh and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bobby Witt</ENAMEX> was the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pitcher</ENAMEX> and he's supposed to be uh you know their their hot guy
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and uh sounded like he got pounded pretty hard
 	
 	
 		he's hot and cold
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		he'll have an outstanding outing and the next time he'll get shelled
 	
 	
 		right and and that's really what the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rangers</ENAMEX> need some some consistency you know outer starter
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		and uh uh i don't know it's going to be interesting
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh my at work my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boss</ENAMEX> got season tickets this year
 		so uh hopefully if i'm real nice to him he's going throw a couple of those my way every <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">now and then</TIMEX> so it will be fun to go out there and watch them
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i see
 		i guess <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ruben Sierra</ENAMEX>'s got an entirely new attitude <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this season</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		that's what they said that uh he really worked out you know hard in off <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX> and uh maybe he can catch a fly ball or two this year
 	
 	
 		he claims to be out there to play ball
 		yeah they say he's really been hustling
 	
 	
 		right God he need to i mean he's got all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">talent</ENAMEX> in the world when it comes around to to hitting the baseball
 	
 	
 		never
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh i mean you got to be a total <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">player</ENAMEX> when you're in the pros
 	
 	
 		well i felt a little guilty but not much when uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robin Yount</ENAMEX> won the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MVP</ENAMEX> instead of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sierra</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		the other year
 	
 	
 		yeah but i don't know
 	
 	
 		but uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yount</ENAMEX> has been a he's a player uh year in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> out and always uh is leading the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> in uh most of most of their offensive categories
 	
 	
 		is that right
 	
 	
 		he really is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> player
 	
 	
 		well that's what it takes to uh because uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sierra</ENAMEX> hasn't shown that kind of maturity yet
 	
 	
 		right to to actually be a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> uh a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> leader
 		and uh you know the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rangers</ENAMEX> really don't have any star <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX> besides <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ryan</ENAMEX> that uh i think the other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX> look up to
 		because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Incaviglia i</ENAMEX> don't think you know uh he stands out to be a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">a real</NUMEX> leader
 	
 	
 		yeah and he hasn't really shown the the talent uh or the promise that they saw when he was at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oklahoma State</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		right right sounds like they have a young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> that they're putting a lot of weight into uh that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Juan Gonzalez</ENAMEX> yeah
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Juan Gonzalez</ENAMEX>
 		yeah he looks to be a a up and coming uh performer
 	
 	
 		yeah so it will be interesting to see you know i think and make him progress and uh get him on board
 	
 	
 		well given the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rangers</ENAMEX>' history they'll probably trade him
 	
 	
 		and then he'll become an all star
 	
 	
 		
 
 		and then he'll
 		right somewhere else
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		that that seems to be the way the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rangers</ENAMEX> operate
 	
 	
 		that's right
 		that's exactly right
 		but uh
 		well i'll tell you what it will be interesting to to get <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the baseball season</TIMEX> going and see how everything turns out
 	
 	
 		how do you think <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oakland</ENAMEX>'s going to do
 	
 	
 		i don't know i tell you what they've uh they've got a big enough payroll they need to uh uh
 	
 	
 		for what they're paying they ought to get they ought to get the performance out of those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> uh
 	
 	
 		go back
 		that's exactly right
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canseco</ENAMEX>'s making <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">five million</NUMEX> a year
 	
 	
 		yeah and i i just don't see uh you know a <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">baseball</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">player</ENAMEX> being worth that
 		or any really any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pro pro athlete</ENAMEX> because we look at that compared to what uh normal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> make i mean it's just totally outrageous
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i i agree
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		i think it is and when when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX> themselves are turning down contracts that are <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three or four years</TIMEX> in duration for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">four million dollars</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> looking for more money yet
 	
 	
 		yeah that that's what ticks me off about old uh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Henderson</ENAMEX> you know wanting to renegotiate renegotiate his contract because uh uh he's not the highest paid <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">player</ENAMEX> anymore
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		well <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> that's that's just ridiculous
 	
 	
 		well it's it's a bidding war between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> and it's also popularity contest between sports to see who can get the biggest uh paycheck
 	
 	
 		right
 		exactly and you know ultimately the the consumer and the uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fan</ENAMEX> are the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that have to pay for it through the
 	
 	
 		because baseball
 		that's true they keep raising the ticket prices <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every year</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		right and through advertisements you know on TV uh because a TV contract is really where they rake in the money and
 	
 	
 		yeah and with what those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> get paid then they go out uh besides <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">baseball</ENAMEX> and and advertise products or they they charge <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">fifteen dollars</NUMEX> for a autograph
 	
 	
 		right that's right
 	
 	
 		
 
 		they've got all this supplemental income coming in as if they aren't <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ma king</ENAMEX> enough already as uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stars</ENAMEX> of the sport
 	
 	
 		exactly and uh
 		you know so i i don't know personally uh you know i'll pay keep paying whatever the ticket prices are but
 		and uh it really does irk me to see those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> out there uh you know making that much money
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh and then the the public you know just continues to you know help support and funnel the funds into uh to make it happen whatever it costs
 	
 	
 		sure yeah i might get to maybe one game out of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> uh in person uh but uh having cable TV and HSE
 	
 	
 		right
 		well that's right you can get your your fill just about
 	
 	
 		yeah i'll watch quite a few games on TV
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		especially to somebody like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nolan</ENAMEX> pitch
 	
 	
 		right right
 		so uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brewers</ENAMEX> always have such hard luck <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Teddy Higuera</ENAMEX> is hurt again
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		he was supposed to pitch an exhibition in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fernando Valenzuela</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh he had a torn rotator cup
 	
 	
 		oh jeez
 	
 	
 		so he's out for at least uh oh i don't know how many <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> they said
 	
 	
 		golly
 	
 	
 		but he may not pitch <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this season</TIMEX> again
 	
 	
 		oh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> that's ridiculous
 	
 	
 		but he's the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">star</ENAMEX> of that uh team their pitching <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> and when he sits out they fizzle
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		that seems typical because most of their other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stars</ENAMEX> uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Molitor</ENAMEX>'s usually out half the season with injuries himself
 	
 	
 		oh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> that makes it tough on the the whole <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">club</ENAMEX> the management all the way down the rest of the players
 	
 	
 		yeah they end up juggling the lineup and trying to fit uh more inexperienced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX> into those roles and they just don't have the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> don't have the skills to carry a team
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right right
 		
 
 		well it will be interesting
 	
 	
 		well i think it will be fun i'm ready for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">baseball season</TIMEX> to start
 	
 	
 		i sort of am too uh i enjoy going out to a couple of the games and and uh
 		i really don't get that involved until the play-offs though uh
 	
 	
 		yeah i agree with that
 	
 	
 		you know the season's just so long
 	
 	
 		right well the preseason really doesn't mean anything either
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		because the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> uh usually play in split <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">squads</ENAMEX> and they're either playing their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rookies</ENAMEX> or their uh
 	
 	
 		that's right depending on what night it is and where they're at uh on whose playing
 	
 	
 		uh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		so once the season gets underway you know they're out there to be serious about what they're doing trying to win games and uh
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i take it from there
 	
 	
 		right right
 		well i tell you what i appreciate the conversation and uh we'll just have to watch and see how it goes comes about
 	
 	
 		okay well good luck to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rangers</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this season</TIMEX>  see if they can pull one out
 	
 	
 		all righty we'll
 		we'll talk to you later bye-bye
 	
 	
 		all right sure thanks bye
