 
     		
 	
 		
 
 		well this is kind of ironic because i work in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX>'s legal department
 	
 	
 		do you
 	
 	
 		and although we don't have any criminal actions here we do have other um lawsuits that do go to trial from time to time
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh when was it <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple weeks ago</TIMEX> i was asked to go to uh jury duty i i wasn't selected but um
 		for some of our cases in particular we have um very technical cases from time to time because of like our patents and such
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		and it's very difficult for lay <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> for somebody who might just you know happen to be selected in our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jury</ENAMEX> to understand what we're talking about
 	
 	
 		well i do think that the cases like the uh oh say something like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texaco</ENAMEX> versus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pennzoil</ENAMEX> or or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texaco Pennzoil</ENAMEX> problem
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> is ridiculous for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> just taken off the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> to understand and really should have some better way where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who understand both the circumstances and the complex issues involved
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		should handle cases like that
 	
 	
 		yeah you know some instances i don't you always have the option now in criminal i guess you always have a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jury</ENAMEX> but in civil cases you have the option of whether you want a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jury</ENAMEX> or not
 	
 	
 		oh is that right
 	
 	
 		yeah and in some incidences i think they ought to ought not to have a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jury</ENAMEX> um
 	
 	
 		yeah oh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> or uh or there should be some way where it could be opted for them not to have a jury
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh i was only on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jury</ENAMEX> ever so far in my life and uh it really was a pretty trivial case and it seemed to me all the time i was thinking of all these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in the courtroom over this
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		case that involved oh a couple <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">thousand dollars</NUMEX> i think it was
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		really just uh uh terrific waste of everybody's time and money
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		and it finally ended up that uh even though we had reached a verdict before we were allowed to give it they settled the case
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		they would they had settled while we were deliberating
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		now the one thing i did approve of there was that we didn't have to be unanimous because it was a civil case
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh we were split uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> so it was uh a good thing that  it wasn't a total waste of time to have a hung <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jury</ENAMEX> on a case that trivial
 	
 	
 		yeah well um i've never fully served i mean i've been asked <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twice</NUMEX> to go down but i didn't get elected on the panel
 		but i know that um for a lot of the civil cases it's rare i mean if your a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> um there you could be a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> who never actually gets into the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtroom</ENAMEX> there's a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> like that that never get to the courtroom
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		some their kind of law doesn't get them to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtroom</ENAMEX> but even in um litigation which is doing lawsuits is a lot of times that you never get to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtroom</ENAMEX> itself and
 	
 	
 		well i think that the trial in a sense is kind of a threat to hold over <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to try to get them to reach an agreement out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> because it does cost so much money
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		but it's a shame that
 		oh it's not so bad for the court system because the money there isn't being spent but there's awful lot of money in time and effort spent in preparing for trial only to then finally get
 		scared enough by going to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> and usually it's the scare kind of of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jury</ENAMEX> because you really don't know one way or the other how that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jury</ENAMEX> is going to feel you could feel that you really have a very strong case
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and that you're very much right but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jury</ENAMEX> may or may not see it that way so you get a little anticipate you know anxious there and go well you know
 	
 	
 		sure
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		well you know i don't feel that sure and who knows what the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jury</ENAMEX> will say because sometimes you know the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">juries</ENAMEX> come down with a result and you go gee
 	
 	
 		yeah i was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witness</ENAMEX> in a case in a criminal case and it was absolutely horrifying to me how that operated because so much evidence was excluded
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		um
 	
 	
 		and that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jury</ENAMEX> was never allowed to hear and they convicted the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">defendant</ENAMEX>
 		on as far as i could tell very flimsy evidence and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> perjured testimonies
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		and i knew the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> involved both the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who perjured and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who uh were defendants
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and yeah i think that was just a a horrible miscarriage of justice because of the uh you know staying by the absolute strict rules and not allowing things to be presented to the jury
 		that uh were highly relevant to the case and could i thought have established the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defendant</ENAMEX>'s innocence
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so uh i do although i'm a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> and i have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX>'s and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judges</ENAMEX> on both sides of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">uncles</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cousins</ENAMEX> and things like that i really
 	
 	
 		oh is that right
 	
 	
 		think that we have gotten into much too legalistic of society and that we we spend far too much on the fine points of the law and far too little on achieving justice
 	
 	
 		yeah and it seems a lot of times that uh especially in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">criminals</ENAMEX> that their rights are so protected but what about the rights of you know the rest of society i mean we're protecting this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>'s rights who has broken the law
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">um</ENAMEX> and we protect him so much but what about the rest of the society you know what are we doing for them we're kind of you know forgetting about them and i think sometimes that a criminal should kind of
 		if he breaks law especially it he's a repeater the law shouldn't just always cover for him that some of his rights as should be taken
 	
 	
 		well and then in a lot of
 		yeah in criminal cases uh for instance you can't bring up prior convictions unless they are somehow directly related to the case
 		and it seems to me that a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jury</ENAMEX> can make a much more rational decision if they know somebody had fifteen convictions for a similar crime
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah and now it's possible that he didn't commit this one but the likelihood is certainly tilted
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		with a record like that and uh that was one of the things that we're not allowed to was not allowed in the uh trial i went to though uh one of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who gave the perjured testimony
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		had a long criminal record and had been you know a real sleaze bag
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		and he came in
 		and was presented to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> as a fine upstanding young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who had uh been in seminary to become a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">priest</ENAMEX> and yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you would have thought the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> was just pure as the driven snow but i happen to know his background and i know that he would have sold out his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> for uh uh shorter sentence
 	
 	
 		jeez
 	
 	
 		and you know it's it's really annoying when the i asked the defense <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> later why he didn't bring up all this other trouble the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> had been in
 		he said that that was barred uh by the court
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		so
 		we do have some problems and it seems to me that uh maybe it's time to just scrap all the case law and go back to general principles and start over
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and then make a legal system that carefully protects <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> but uh where
 	
 	
 		yeah i'd even go for for trying to get some truth out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witness</ENAMEX> stand if they come up with some pretty reliable uh
 		lie detector tests that we can see right then and there whether they're lying or telling the truth
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah that would be helpful
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah you know
 	
 	
 		sure would
 	
 	
 		yeah i witnessed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> trial <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many years ago</TIMEX> when i was first um studying to be a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">paralegal</ENAMEX> and uh
 		uh they barred priors on this uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> and they never then told us i guess because priors had a reason as to why these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> were very much in hatred of each other
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		and they never told us why these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> had such a vendetta against each other and the crime was uh uh attempt to commit murder you know and
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		but they never told us why these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> were mad at each other and gee you know that's
 	
 	
 		and you think that would be relevant
 	
 	
 		yeah you know because they they told us in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> that you know crime has to be an intent you know has to be not just the act but you have to intend to do it because there could be accidental kind of things you know
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but they never told us why these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> hated themselves or if one had done something to you know really aggravate the other there was never any motive
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		given and and i had a tough time with that and and being a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> who saw what the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jury</ENAMEX> didn't plus what the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jury</ENAMEX> did because we were just observing you know there in the courtroom
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		at the end of it all i still didn't know  i still have a lot of reasonable doubts and i've seen everything presented
 	
 	
 		yeah right
 	
 	
 		and you know they just haven't done a real complete case here to my thinking
 	
 	
 		uh-huh i think so and uh and
 	
 	
 		i don't know that i want to sit on a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jury</ENAMEX> like that and you'd still you know i want ask some questions
 		here
 	
 	
 		yeah that's something i thought would be a very good idea of when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">juries</ENAMEX> come in they are told just to shut up and listen
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and it seems to me that you'd get a lot more uh information if your questions were heard if you were allowed to ask the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witnesses</ENAMEX> things or if or the lawyers things or even the judge
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		right
 	
 	
 		but particularly the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witnesses</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah allow them to uh go back and and deliberate and uh you know after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each days</TIMEX> proceedings come out with some questions that they want answered like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next day</TIMEX> bring those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> back
 	
 	
 		or if they would allow them to uh give broader answers they it's really kind of uh choreographed it's like a script has been written when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> testify they aren't testifying really in their own words
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		yeah i can remember
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> of daddy
