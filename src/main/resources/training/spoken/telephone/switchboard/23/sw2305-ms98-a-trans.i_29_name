 
     		
 	
 		okay um well the first thing uh what do you think you would offer as far as uh
 		uh information about selecting a school
 	
 	
 		well first i think they've got to have a pretty good idea of what they want to what they want to do uh once they have that then they can start looking in
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		all the various <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publications</ENAMEX> that give out all the information about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> and write to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> themselves
 		and start finding out about the different requirements for the programs and what kind of uh of job assistance and all that other kind of stuff they offer
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh do you do you feel that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first two years</TIMEX> that the um depending upon the field i know there are some fields which a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> should go to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> that school <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all four years</TIMEX>
 		but i know there are some <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">fields</ENAMEX> where it's really not necessary
 	
 	
 		yeah a lot fields are most of your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">liberal</ENAMEX> arts degrees and stuff aren't really concerned with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">your first two years</TIMEX> anyway it's it's your core education your general requirements general education requirements um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		if you know if they want to get a liberal arts degree i don't i don't know what advice i'd give them go to the school you'd like to go to  that's what i did
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i didn't care about the program or anything else i went where i wanted to go
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah what was your degree in
 	
 	
 		uh political science
 	
 	
 		political science oh okay well  i know i know i'm going to school right now and uh i have a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTD University of Texas Dallas</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		where are you at
 		well yeah i guess everybody's in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> that i talk to i'm in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">north Carolina</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i know well that's where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texas Instruments</ENAMEX> is
 	
 	
 		yeah right
 	
 	
 		um something that i i think that i've noticed that i i have a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> i think if you're going into like uh law or medicine
 		a very particular very specific field even even engineering you can get you can meet a lot of the requirements at a public
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">um</ENAMEX> institution
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		and uh it's a lot cheaper my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> made a mistake in uh in sending my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> to a private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first two years</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		um
 	
 	
 		and she found out after that she said you know my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> they just they really wasted a lot of money this is about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty years ago</TIMEX> but uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		well right now i just i mean as far as selecting selecting a school i i i feel that uh a lot of it depends upon the major
 	
 	
 		yeah it does Um i didn't know what i wanted to do after i got my my degree um originally i had planned
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> undergrad degree in political science and then a master's in public <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> And i went ahead and pursued that i i got as far as the thesis and decided To hell with it i didn't want it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Um</ENAMEX> and from that point i went to law school and after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a half</NUMEX> of that i decided i didn't want that either  haven't figured out what i want to be when i grow up
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 		okay
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and so but i i i really did enjoy the law i mean that's that's where i wanted to be but i didn't want to go through the uh the hassle that the law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> put you through because i never did want to be a practicing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> i just wanted a law degree
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i've since discovered that i would be far better off being in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">paralegal</ENAMEX> field because that's the nuts and bolts of the law and that's what i like
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and you don't have to put up with all the B S that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> have to so that's that's what i'm pursuing right now
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and i'm pretty happy with it so far
 	
 	
 		um
 		yeah yeah i'm i'm pursuing what they what's what's called an interdisciplinary field i'm a speech therapy major and fortunately i have a lot of i have a good medical background and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah that's probably very useful
 	
 	
 		yeah it's it's actually turning out to be more more useful than what i thought and um i also have a good languages background linguistics
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and some psychology so it's all working together the only field i'm not familiar with really is education which is required as well it requires <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about four or five</NUMEX> different fields really
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh good grief
 	
 	
 		so it's a
 	
 	
 		yeah i thought at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time i wanted to be a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> but i i quickly dispelled that idea when i became a substitute <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> for a while just to get my feet wet i said uh i couldn't do this everyday no way
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 	
 	
 		maybe maybe being a tenured <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> would be one thing but being a public school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> is entirely another thing
 	
 	
 		um
 		oh
 		so you are a disgruntled <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">graduate</ENAMEX> student
 	
 	
 		i am a disgruntled i am i am just a disgruntled <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> all around  i'm the uh i'm the uh original uh mister Scrooge i guess
 	
 	
 		oh
 		
 
 		yeah bah humbug
 	
 	
 		yeah bah humbug Yeah i just
 	
 	
 		i i i think yeah there is i i i think uh law would be a fine field a fine profession fine field to go into um i know one time i was in a political science class and you know talking about
 		fields <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> going into different fields i made an off off the cuff remark about <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> about their integrity being questionable and i mean oh that was like a can of worms  no
 	
 	
 		probably you probably got everybody on you because they were probably all going to law school
 	
 	
 		no there was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> she said  my my best <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> and you know all this and it was just
 	
 	
 		well that remark in itself is a slam My best <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> you know like like uh my best <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> are blacks
 	
 	
 		yeah i know it was
 		or or <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> it used to be <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> you know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">jewish</ENAMEX> now <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> and i guess i i guess <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Iraqi</ENAMEX> now is the
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i know it but
 	
 	
 		law law was a lot of fun until you get to law school
 		and it doesn't become fun anymore
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i have a  i have a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> she's studying she's going into law another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> going into law and that she's i i i'm really i'm really concerned about you know she's just going to be
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know what's going to happen when she gets there you know all of her dreams will be dispelled
 	
 	
 		yeah you going
 		oh yeah Yeah if if if you've ever seen the program paper chase it's very much like that except worse
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah it's i i think it's probably more embarrassing and very painful i i see i see that happening
 	
 	
 		it is
 		yeah very much so yeah it's it's a lot of that Um it it was enjoyable for a while
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um but it's such a grind and you begin to wonder you know if if i'm not i mean you really have to be dead set on being a lawyer
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		to do it if you have any doubts whatsoever you better not get into it i mean i wasted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a half</NUMEX> of awfully hard and i aged <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten years</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but i i i wouldn't trade the experience for anything in the world It never hurts to have some kind of a grounding in law
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah i i went to a language school and and that was a it was a an
 		i guess uh  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States Institution</ENAMEX> it was i was military at the time and i i think probably the biggest huh
 	
 	
 		what <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> were you in what <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> were you in i was too
 	
 	
 		i was in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX> yeah yeah for myself i mean i think that military experience was fine it was just i just wish that there was something else that that that i could have done you know with
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah well i got i got tired of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">service</ENAMEX> after a while i mean it i had a terrific job really enjoyed it uh command post
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		uh
 		i was i was a linguist
 	
 	
 		i was just wondering were you in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">SAC</ENAMEX> by any chance
 		were you in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAC</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		hum
 		in TAC
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAC</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh no i wasn't
 	
 	
 		oh okay i i thought maybe you might have had some experience with the uh R C <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one thirty</TIMEX> fives
 	
 	
 		no no i didn't i didn't go flight <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crew</ENAMEX> matter of fact i didn't make it completely through that through that field i was i was in intelligence <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about three weeks</TIMEX> short
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		i didn't make it i sort of washed out
 	
 	
 		well that's
 	
 	
 		yeah after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about eighteen months</TIMEX> of talking about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year and a half</TIMEX> training you know it's it's something you know i think that's why you know <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> really need to
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		think about the field they're going to going into and i mean spend a lot of serious reading before they i mean not just thinking about they actually should do some reading and they should study it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		that's right and it
 		and if it's possible even get some experience at it or at least watch some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> do it
 	
 	
 		yeah i i i i think i think there's a lot to be said for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> working after school i mean they they find out whether just how much of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people person</ENAMEX> they are
 	
 	
 		uh-huh sure
 		that's true i found that out when i was in high school i worked at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McDonald's</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh and i tell you what i worked at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McDonald's</ENAMEX> as well and i i can tell you one thing there are just some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that i you know you just came to the point where
 		i mean and oh i eventually worked in a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lab</ENAMEX> in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lab</ENAMEX> as a lab <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">technician</ENAMEX> and i worked front desk and i mean somebody could walk in the door and i knew exactly what they were going to do and say
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i was the same way too i'm not a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people person</ENAMEX> i i i hate um
 		having to play such a nice <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> you know especially when it's all phony especially when you got some uh jerk coming in
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i it's just not for me i'm uh i deal much better in research and books and stuff like that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		which is why i'm going to enjoy the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">paralegal</ENAMEX> field a lot
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 		that's good i was just wondering um
 		getting back to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> thing so i mean i
 		i i almost wish that there was some
