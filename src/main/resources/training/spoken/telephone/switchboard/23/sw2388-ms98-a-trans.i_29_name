 
     		
 	
 		okay well uh so what do you think about golfing are you a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spectator</ENAMEX> or a player
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh i'm definitely a player i guess uh there is some question about that when i total up the score but
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		yeah i know how you feel about that that's true
 		what's what's uh what's the best part of your game do you think
 	
 	
 		oh i like to uh i think putting is probably my uh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">forte</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		what is your worst then
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i guess i have the most trouble with chipping how about you
 	
 	
 		well i think  i think my best part actually is chipping or at least it was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> i haven't been out <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> it's kind of been uh kind of strange i hadn't been able to get out yet but uh my biggest problem is staying in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">fairway</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 		for you know with drives and stuff um
 	
 	
 		yeah i used to have a lot of trouble with that with a wicked slide and so forth but i think i've overcome a good deal of that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah i've i've gone in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past years</TIMEX> from uh having a wicked slice to having a wicked hook to back to having a wicked slice i mean it's just uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and i can't seem to find the middle space you know but i've got a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> of mine working on it uh i've trying to help me out i've been going to the driving range with him and and it seems to be doing some um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i've always threatened to take lessons but i've never gotten around to it
 	
 	
 		yeah well lessons are are okay if you do it right i think i did i took some lessons uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of years back</TIMEX> but to tell you the truth that  for a while hurt more than it helped because i it turned out that i couldn't do anything right after that
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		um
 		and even you know like i said my chipping which is one of the best things in my game i couldn't do that i couldn't couldn't drive couldn't you know in in fact it was it wasn't as much at that point that i was hooking and slicing i just i was topping the ball i was
 		you know i was doing a lot of things wrong at that point but i was trying to think of so many different things at the same time because you know it was
 		it it's kind of a funny story whenever i went for for my first lesson
 		the uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">instructor</ENAMEX> takes me out there and he says all right well take a swing and let me see how you look so he's he's bending down on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> knee right so i take a swing and and all of a sudden his head just goes down
 		and and then all of a you know he just kind of slowly brings his head up and looks at me and he says we've got a lot of work to do  so
 	
 	
 		
 
 		built that confidence right up there huh
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i was feeling real good then so  he broke me down from i mean he started me from the very beginning as far as changing just about everything i did and uh
 		uh
 	
 	
 		that can be bad i mean you know a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> say
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well that's like i said
 	
 	
 		it's best to take your lessons right at the beginning before you learn the bad habits i guess
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		oh that's definitely true in fact if uh if i ever you know have a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> or anything i'm definitely going to uh you know  teach him have a lesson or something is that yours or mine
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i think that's mine
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		let me just quick catch it and i'll be back
 	
 	
 		all right
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i'm back
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah uh
 		they uh
 		
 
 		my uh i have an interesting anecdote
 	
 	
 		what's that
 	
 	
 		
 
 		my uh my uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> who goes up to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A&M</ENAMEX> he's had the pleasure of having a hole in one
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		well uh you know the only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> i've ever known that had a hole in one was my brother-in-law but uh and he he said he got his luckily so i don't know that's that's but i mean
 	
 	
 		yeah well i guess there's a certain amount of luck in any hole in one
 	
 	
 		i came so close once just once i mean that's the only time i've ever been any anywhere near but i mean i it was i used to live out in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Midland Texas</ENAMEX> i don't know if you've ever been out there but it's you know a real windy place
 	
 	
 		oh thank God i've never been to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Midland</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah i i played on a course out there and like i said it's a very windy place so it's you know the wind was blowing and it was cold and it was like it was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about a hundred</NUMEX> and i don't know a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundred</NUMEX> and seventy or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred</NUMEX> and eighty year par three
 		and i you know the wind was right in my face so i just pulled out a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> wood right and i put that thing i mean it rolled right by the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">cup</NUMEX> and only ended up <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">three inches</NUMEX> off but you know over over past the hole but i mean that's as close as i've ever been you know
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		because i'm not you know that's one of my problems is controlling my my my irons on a par <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> so i have a lot of trouble hitting the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">greens</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so do you do you like watching it though i mean
 	
 	
 		well one of my uh well control
 		and uh and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contact</ENAMEX> are a big problem and they still are
 		this one of the things i was doing wrong was too much back swing and hurrying my back swing
 	
 	
 		yeah well that's that's exactly what my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> has has figured out that i do is my i can actually see the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">club</ENAMEX> on my backswing and and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and he says that what i do is i'm actually crossing the plain is what this is his words his technical words for it crossing yeah
 	
 	
 		that sounds like the exact same words my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> tells me
 	
 	
 		yeah because it because i ended up into an inverted C where the weight was on the wrong foot or something so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i i've found that i actually do of uh i get a lot uh better control and distance if i don't you know don't take as big a back swing
 	
 	
 		yeah if i can convince myself not to try and kill it i sure you always get a lot better results
 	
 	
 		yeah what's funny is the idea that uh you know what i consider you know like a three-quarter backswing or even a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> backswing
 		uh my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> says that's you know that's a full backswing and you don't want to go any further than that so i mean it's a now it's a matter of trying to convince myself that that's right
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so i don't know it's going to be interesting
 	
 	
 		well you have to prove it to yourself just by doing it a few times
 	
 	
 		um that's probably true
 		well
 	
 	
 		it's a frustrating game golf
 	
 	
 		oh isn't it though i don't know why i do it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		it's getting more expensive unfortunately too
 	
 	
 		oh  that's that's one of the worse things about it it really is but uh
 		you know
 	
 	
 		like you i haven't played any or not much this year i played a couple of times but
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i went out skiing in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February</TIMEX> and took uh little tumble down the slopes and so i'm nursing a wounded wing right
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know that's it you have to be healthy too that's another point i guess
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		well i think that's about it
 	
 	
 		yeah well i love the game so uh i enjoyed talking about it
 	
 	
 		yeah i do too
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well you take care yeah good luck
 	
 	
 		okay  enjoyed it
 		bye-bye
 	
 	
 		
 
 		bye
