 
     		
 	
 		so well you're you're you're you you take this subject much more personally than i do i suppose
 	
 	
 		i suppose i do because i've seen a lot of those changes the the changes that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> have had in the last generation well you know not even the last <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">generation the last fifteen years twenty years</TIMEX> going from well
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		take it back <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty years</TIMEX>  i'm going back too far from my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mom</ENAMEX> stayed home
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		period and and there was no such thing as a job or any hope of a job until well unless if you were educated you got you know you might teach for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year or two</TIMEX> before you got married
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and if you really pushed it you taught until you had <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> or something you know if you had if you were a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> then you know that was it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		until the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> you were little
 	
 	
 		yeah you you weren't supposed to want a job
 	
 	
 		yes there was not there's not supposed to be any reason to use this education or this brain that you might have for anything other than your <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and how clean can the the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bathroom floors</ENAMEX> be on any given day
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and then
 		and then of course <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> it's supposed to be all the other way you're supposed to only want the job
 		and and uh your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> should be totally happy in day care because everybody else goes to day care and and we have these wonderful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who are
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		who are totally prepared to teach to teach your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> everything they need to know in day care and
 	
 	
 		yeah but but
 	
 	
 		and uh we'll see how the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX> go huh
 	
 	
 		but uh a really good day care is probably going to cost more than you're going to make at the job
 	
 	
 		yeah i at least for a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> depending on on what she did i've i was an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineer</ENAMEX> with uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		mechanical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineer</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T I</ENAMEX>
 		and uh i did it for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six years</TIMEX>
 		and for one well i had one while i was pregnant and then one while my oldest was a year old
 		and and it just drove me crazy
 	
 	
 		did you
 	
 	
 		i could not do either well enough i couldn't put in enough overtime that was necessary or that you know things that would come up at work that would require me to stay late or to come in early or to do something on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturdays</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		as is you know as is needed and because my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> had had for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a long time</TIMEX> was out of the country
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		also with uh with work for like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three months</TIMEX> and and
 	
 	
 		so it was you and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX> and your work schedule is well that's the thing see you know maybe if you get along for example if you'd been a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">technician</ENAMEX> instead of an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineer</ENAMEX> you know the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">technicians</ENAMEX> work the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight to five</NUMEX> job and and know when they're going to be there
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		it might have been better
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh if you're going to be more professional professional oriented
 		then you've got to have this to be able to perform well on the job you've got to have the flexibility that
 		that doesn't really go with the family
 	
 	
 		yeah and so it was in my case i i just uh decided that as long as my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> were little i would be better off at home with them instead of driving myself crazy trying to do everything at once
 	
 	
 		um-hum so you figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of these days you're going to go back to being an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineer</ENAMEX> is that what you think
 	
 	
 		well actually i've found out that i'm not going to go back to being an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineer</ENAMEX>  i'm i'm i'm a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">photographer</ENAMEX> now
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		oh okay you've found something else
 	
 	
 		i have i have branched out i was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">photographer</ENAMEX> before but when i went to college it was i felt like i couldn't support myself if i decided to be a photographer
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that it would just have to be a hobby and i'm i'm very mechanical and mechanical engineering interested me so i did that and then i you know i did that for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six years</TIMEX>
 		and then i stayed home with my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> and did nothing and found out that i was that you know it was great but i was bored part of the time too and i wanted something else
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i mean you figure there's got to be more to life than sitting here playing with this child
 	
 	
 		to do
 		yeah and it's it's great while they're really little but as they get older
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and they're more independent and there's things to do then it's good for them to go to different i mean it he goes to a a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>'s day out program now once a week both of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> do
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and so they're getting they they get the socialization with other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> and you you know and not really school but
 		but a different authority than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mom</ENAMEX> once in a while you know and kind of learning how to deal with society
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and and they they need that you know to be able to relate to other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> besides
 	
 	
 		yeah i think they do too
 	
 	
 		the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i need it for the break  so
 	
 	
 		yeah well that's the other thing you know they talk about <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> leaving the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> and going out to work well still taking care of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> is a very important job and and someone's got to do it and be able to do it right and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		and enjoy it that's that's the whole thing
 	
 	
 		and if it's not
 		if it's not <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mom</ENAMEX> then then <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> or somebody's got to move in there and do the job because the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> really need it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i think that's the thing that were going to see well i think the biggest thing we're going to see coming up in the next
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten years</TIMEX> even in the even now they're starting to do it but i think it's going to be more in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next ten to fifteen years</TIMEX> is that there's going to be a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> and they're going to have to work it out to working part time
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		because if if i if i had been allowed to work
 		you know maybe <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty hours a week</TIMEX> instead of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">fifty hours</TIMEX> a week
 		i might still be working basically full time or part time if there was if there had been some way to work it out because i liked my job really well but i was just pulled in so many different directions i was it was just driving me crazy
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and now with the photography that's you know it's working that's what i'm doing is working part time because i can put my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> in a day care situation for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a few hours</TIMEX> in the uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week</TIMEX> and and use those <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> to do the the thing that i'm doing is taking school pictures
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX> cares and in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>'s day out programs and also soccer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> and you know different stuff like that so my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		can be in day care for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a few hours</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a week</TIMEX> or my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> if it's you know and and when he's at home can take care of them
 	
 	
 		yeah so jobs have to i guess become more flexible
 	
 	
 		i think they're really going to have to and not and not just for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fathers</ENAMEX> as well
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's going to have to be both
 	
 	
 		well so so that's another thing that has to adapt is you know the the the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>'s attitudes about you know whose whose job is this
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		well it's it's his job too and i to me the only important issue is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> because as far as housework goes you know <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> can do housework just as easily as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> and thanks to a lot of new inventions housework doesn't take as much time as it used to
 		so uh
 	
 	
 		you know it's just convincing your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> that's important or that that that it's important enough for him to do it because if he saw mom
 	
 	
 		to me yeah to yeah to me
 		yeah well
 	
 	
 		doing only that you know all the time he was growing up then it's hard to think of it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		in that other you know uh that i should do it or that or just to think about doing it rat her than having someone  tell him to do it i know that was a big thing in our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a long time</TIMEX> was that if i wanted my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> to do something to help
 	
 	
 		and you you you
 		yeah you talk yeah
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and even though we were both working the same number of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> and and doing things i had to come in there specifically and say this needs to be done this is what you do it now no
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> might say out loud well you know i understand this and i agree but still he was raised with a mom taking care of him and and that's a very hard attitude to change
 	
 	
 		yes and
 		yeah and without and and it's just they don't look at things most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> don't walk into the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen</ENAMEX> and see that the dishes are there and that yes you probably ought to unload the dishwasher and load the new ones in and run it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		they just you know just kind of scoot it on another spot on the  on the sink and and put the next plate down and and in a while get around to it and i think most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> walk in and and
 		and with oh got to clean all this up got to get this out and this in and this you know taken care of instead of having someone say now this needs to be done this is the time this needs to be done but
 	
 	
 		hm uh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 		and a lot of that is is how it was drilled into you when you were a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX> which brings us back to the idea you know someone's got to be there taking care of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> to drill in these you know drill in the right ideas
 	
 	
 		that's right
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		to so that they know that uh you know  male and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">female</ENAMEX> are both responsible for doing this and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		and i think that's that's going to show up a lot more now in the in the next generation of of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> it's not they're not going to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> in this next generation are not going to have to be told as much
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		this needs to be done because <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mom</ENAMEX> was there saying that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> is there you know you both got to they were both working at whatever things were
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		needed to be done they're going to say to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> you need do this because it needs to be done not because it's a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>'s job or a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>'s job but because it's dirty and it needs to be cleaned
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 		but i think in between we got a a group of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> a generation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> who didn't learn to take responsibility because
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mom</ENAMEX> left to go get a job and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> didn't move in to fill the gap and so basically no one was taking the responsibility
 		and i i think that's happened in a lot of cases
 	
 	
 		and it's gonna
 		it's gonna yeah some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> are really having it If they'd been in day care the entire time and it wasn't
 		yeah the ones that are now getting to be <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teenagers</ENAMEX> and in some cases young college
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum um you know some time day care is really good but sometimes it's just it's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> sitting it's someone you know keeping an eye on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> but the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> are basically doing what they want and not really having any
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		relationship with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> to say you know here's what's right and here's what's wrong and and here's what we expect of you
 	
 	
 		yeah i think that was one of the main reasons that i quit was because i wanted my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> to have my values
 		and i felt like when they were young that was the time to instill it that it could be it could be added to and strengthened as they grew older but when they were little
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know this is the way i feel about this and this is the way because i it's you know when you when you if you if you teach them when they're little the way you want them to be and the things that are important to you then you just you add onto it as they get older
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but if no one does anything when they're little
 		then it's twice as hard as i think as they get older
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm i'm saying this as i'm trying to keep my <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nine month old</TIMEX> from trashing something
 	
 	
 		yes i understand i i wait until i put <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mine</ENAMEX> in bed before i make my calls
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah well she's usually in bed by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this time</TIMEX> but she's staying up <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">late tonight</TIMEX> but yeah you know i want to i want to have a relationship with her you know my my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> was a very traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> and when i was a child i didn't really know my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> very well and i miss that
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		that's the thing if <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>'s role like we said if <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>'s roles change drastically <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>'s roles will too and a lot of it's for the better some of the some of the women's roles i think are almost for the worse because we're losing out on some things going back to work
 	
 	
 		and i want
 		yeah the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> have to be convinced of that
 	
 	
 		but i think
 		if we can if we can expand the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>'s roles at the same time like your taking care of your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> and your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> probably didn't very often i know i know <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mine</ENAMEX> almost never did
 	
 	
 		no
