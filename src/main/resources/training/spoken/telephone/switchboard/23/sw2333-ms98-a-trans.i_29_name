 
     		
 	
 		all right so we're supposed to talk about food maybe we'll get a call back saying hey you're not you're not talking about food
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um
 		no no you can talk about anything you want these these things are just suggestions
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh golly well i live in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> what what area do you live in
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">uh North Carolina</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Carolina</ENAMEX> oh really
 	
 	
 		it is boring here
 	
 	
 		oh really well
 	
 	
 		boring
 	
 	
 		in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Carolinas</ENAMEX> they did have uh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">huh</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jimmy Baker</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um yes yes we're
 	
 	
 		
 
 		he's he's not a subject of great pride
 	
 	
 		oh yes it's it's one of our prouder  right along with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jessie Helms</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		i think i think they were pardon the phrase all in bed together or something
 	
 	
 		twins separated at birth kind of thing
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		somebody somebody let the brains run out on the floor though
 	
 	
 		somebody dropped that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> when it was born  oh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Bakker</ENAMEX> oh what a what a dangerous individual
 	
 	
 		i i i know uh how how did <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jessie Helms</ENAMEX> get reelected that's that's what i want to know
 	
 	
 		that's a well that's a good question um
 	
 	
 		what does he do does he just do the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> the are there just <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stupid people</ENAMEX> where you live or something okay
 	
 	
 		yeah basically yeah yeah that's
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		that's that's most of it and he plays very heavily on the race issue
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and it's still that's still a big thing here in this backwards state
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that's too bad because i mean i've been in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Carolinas</ENAMEX> and you know there are some places in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Carolinas</ENAMEX> it's really nice there
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah my favorite place is Ashville it's right over there in the mountains it's a beautiful place
 	
 	
 		in  like
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's just that you know i mean if you took all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> out of the state it would be a great place
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX> are so backwards it's just ridiculous it's pathetic
 	
 	
 		i i know i think literacy probably the biggest problem there
 	
 	
 		yeah and i i mean the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX> are just full of all of this stuff about the educational system they've been changing their standards and this that and the other and claiming this is going to make everything better
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">uh Durham</ENAMEX> the county right next to us big city
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		had an enormous jump in the uh in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SAT</ENAMEX> rate
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		and everybody was huh
 	
 	
 		how'd they do that
 		oh let me guess what they did they had classes on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SAT</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh no it was even worse than that they falsified the data
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		oh <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Plano Plano</ENAMEX> started having
 	
 	
 		yeah just just students
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plano</ENAMEX> actually they went out and they had the where where i live they had the they had the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SAT</ENAMEX> i've never heard anything so preposterous in my life
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		they're preparing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> for the test by having a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> specifically for the test how ridiculous i mean of course it has the highest
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SAT</ENAMEX> rate well it also has the highest teen suicide rate too so i mean that and this is national  i don't know where it's all going to  where it's all going to go
 	
 	
 		oh well
 		
 
 		i don't know
 		i don't i don't know what's i mean public education is just going down the tubes i mean they're throwing more and more money at it and it just seems to be getting worse and worse
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and you know what's bad i mean like i'm going into you know an education related <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">field</ENAMEX> and i just you know it just
 		you know it really kills me you know i mean it's it it really is a shame that you know you know <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> somehow we spend more money on each student
 		and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> are paid so little i mean i mean how do how do they figure that out
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		i don't know that's that's the one thing that i've i've never been able to figure out why you can pay garbage <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> more than you can pay <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		well the prestige of being a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> is also pretty nil well i think a lot of that has to do with the fact that they say well since this is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> dominated field we can treat them like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dirt</ENAMEX>  you know
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		yeah i guess
 	
 	
 		that that that must be the rationale for for where it comes from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it it must be i bet you know i i i'm not knocking the garbage <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> i mean they're necessary but there's a lot of unemployed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> out there who would gladly take jobs as garbage <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> rate for less money
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hey</ENAMEX> that's a
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hey</ENAMEX> that's a hard job to get really
 	
 	
 		it is
 	
 	
 		in in in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> it's hard because it's almost like a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> thing
 	
 	
 		yeah well it's it's it's hard in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> too and i mean they get paid <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty eight thousand a year</TIMEX> to start
 	
 	
 		gee that's that's ridiculous
 	
 	
 		and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> only get paid <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty four</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		man i'd carry garbage for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty eight thousand a year</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		you bet you
 		you bet you
 	
 	
 		man i worked as a welder and i was you don't even get paid that much
 	
 	
 		man i'd i'd go out and dump garbage all the time for that kind of money
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		good exercise you get outside
 		shoot
 	
 	
 		yep
 		you have  <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> are your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>  knock over a can now and then and leave it open for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> you know
 	
 	
 		well
 		
 
 		
 
 		ah that's what my that's what my garbage <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> does
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i went out <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the other morning</TIMEX> and my my garbage can was sitting in the middle of my driveway
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		jeez i get tired of this i've got a there's a nice little wooden platform out there for the garbage cans and then they throw them anywhere they want to
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and sometimes they don't even take everything that that's the biggest kick
 	
 	
 		oh
 		so you live in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Carolinas</ENAMEX> huh
 	
 	
 		the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Carolinas</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh

 		no i'm not i'm not a fool
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		i i'm i'm not really impressed with i mean i lived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three years</TIMEX> i i was i'm not impressed with skiing now i like
 		i like other
 		you know <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> sports but i'm not real thrilled about them
 	
 	
 		i i it's okay to watch <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> go out and break their legs but i'm not going to climb on a couple of pieces of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wood</ENAMEX> and go racing down a slick mountain side i mean that's
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i've got better things to do with my life
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		when i uh when i was uh stationed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX> i used the opportunity to travel around <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> a lot and one of my favorite places to go was <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Switzerland</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
  
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		
  
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and it was just great to sit out there in uh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Zurich</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bern</ENAMEX> just sit in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sidewalk</ENAMEX> cafes
 	
 	
 		
  
 		oh yeah the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cafe</ENAMEX> um my my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> her favorite actually she was stationed at in in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> with me too and

 		yeah
 		yeah really i mean <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Switzerland</ENAMEX> is so clean
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh
 	
 	
 		not even a scrap of paper on the ground you know
 	
 	
 		well they have these there these real like real strict laws you know they have to hose down the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every every other day</TIMEX> or something

 		and we like we bought we filled a full a cooler full of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> of all this delicatessen food  and then
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		we ate it all the way going up to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> because the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> was so so bad and then when we came into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> i had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> centime left i mean that's like that's that's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five one</NUMEX> hundredths of a franc which is worth
