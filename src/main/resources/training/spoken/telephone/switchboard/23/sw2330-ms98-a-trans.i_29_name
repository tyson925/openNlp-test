 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		yeah well um i think the weather lately has been um a bit warmer than i would expect this time of year
 	
 	
 		there we go
 		i think that's true
 		the uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bermuda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">grass</ENAMEX> is greening up
 		uh in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">in March</TIMEX> it sometimes doesn't really start doing that until the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> part of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX> so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so i think we're a little ahead uh ahead of schedule on that
 	
 	
 		yeah i was out in my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">yard</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> and i noticed all that grass coming up and i thought ooh we've got to start this mowing bit soon
 	
 	
 		that's true it's been a  a fun break but it the break is over
 	
 	
 		yeah  well um oh i guess another thing i've noticed too here lately is that even though we've had some pretty warm <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> it's been awfully gray you know just
 	
 	
 		yeah now <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last couple of weekends</TIMEX> have been nice and sunny
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		but it seems like every time at work i look out my window it's gray
 	
 	
 		well yeah but i'd rather have a sunny <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekend</TIMEX> than a gray <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekend</TIMEX> so
 	
 	
 		oh i go for that yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		in fact i'm a little worried about this one coming up here we have <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a long weekend</TIMEX> and it sounds like it's gonna be a little bit on the cool side
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i hadn't heard whether it's <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gonna rain</ENAMEX> or not
 	
 	
 		i think there's an eighty <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">percent</NUMEX> chance <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this evening</TIMEX> but it's supposed to be cleared out at least by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">noon</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX> and then the rest'll be
 		without rain
 	
 	
 		well that's good
 	
 	
 		but i think the highs are gonna be in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the sixties</TIMEX> and the lows in the forties
 		that's getting back to a little bit chillier
 	
 	
 		yeah that's probably a  a little bit under what it is for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this time of year</TIMEX> i i think i haven't seen the weather the news the weather
 		on the news in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the evening</TIMEX> lately but i think the average high would be it should be about seventy
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm not certain either but you're probably right
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		well i like it when it's sort of a a medium temperature uh maybe seventy <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> to eighty somewhere in there i i don't like it when it's too cool or too warm
 		i'm much more apt to get things done when it's at that sort of in between temperature
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true
 		um
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the remarkable things about the weather in the summertime here is that quite often the average <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">daytime</TIMEX> high
 		of say <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ninety nine</NUMEX> degrees is within <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">five or six degrees</NUMEX> of the all time record high
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		and what that tells me is that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX> weather is very predictable
 		that it doesn't vary very much
 	
 	
 		yeah you're probably right
 	
 	
 		yeah i mean any other time of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> that's not the case because it could be very warm or very cold
 	
 	
 		yes as a matter of fact i heard the weather <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the other day</TIMEX> on TV and i think it was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this week a year</TIMEX> ago
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		they said that we had a freeze and some kind of bad weather you know it wasn't just a super bad storm but it was it was that sort of thing that we never like to see in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late spring</TIMEX> time
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 		yeah  one of the weirdest things i saw i think it was around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this time last year</TIMEX>
 		was a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty six</TIMEX> degree lightning storm
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		i you know i was going into the grocery <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX> and a  a lightning bolt was almost directly overhead and it was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">twenty six degrees</NUMEX> out
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		and i thought well gee i've i've never known it to lightning at that temperature
 	
 	
 		yeah that that is pretty unusual
 		and you really take notice of it too uh
 	
 	
 		that's right it uh it probably was a lot warmer up high
 		sometimes they get those inversions like when we had that
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twelve and a half</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days a few years ago</TIMEX> that it never got up as high as freezing
 		the air temperature at <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">five thousand feet</NUMEX> was fifty degrees
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		because the cold weather was just simply trapped along the ground and couldn't get away
 	
 	
 		wow
 		yeah i don't don't like that super cold stuff
 	
 	
 		nope
 	
 	
 		i just don't move very well when it's that cold
 	
 	
 		yep i i'm really enjoying this now
 		well this has been interesting
 	
 	
 		yeah well
 	
 	
 		not not too challenging to the brain
 	
 	
 		not not a real in depth topic but  enjoyed talking to you
 	
 	
 		nope
 		all right <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ellen</ENAMEX> well you have a good day
 	
 	
 		okay okay good-bye
 	
 	
 		bye-bye
