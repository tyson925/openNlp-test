 
     		
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hi Ellen</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		hi
 	
 	
 		um do you uh could you tell me if you uh budget your <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</TIMEX> expenses
 	
 	
 		no we don't really do anything formal um
 		i kind of keep up with all the finances you know paying the bills and typically i do most of the spending too as well so uh you know i kind of have a handle on it and
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i just sort of know what we can and can't do and
 		it you know it's worked pretty well i haven't really gotten into any major problems without having something formal
 	
 	
 		yeah how about how about uh long term do you have anything uh for <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">as far as as far as</NUMEX> savings go for long term
 	
 	
 		well yeah
 		yeah we have uh you know like a typical credit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">union</ENAMEX> account for you know just a a basic savings thing and then uh we've got you know the IRA's and CD's and
 		various and sundry you know long term kinds of things
 	
 	
 		uh yeah
 	
 	
 		how about you
 	
 	
 		okay that's uh uh we used to budget when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> were small
 		um
 		things were and there was only one income so we had to watch what we were doing
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and our savings weren't that great but now the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> are all grown up and gone in fact the youngest is is uh
 		finally getting out of college this uh May
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		so we've we don't budget anymore we run basically the same as you do you kind of know what you're going to spend uh week to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week</TIMEX> or or you have your <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</TIMEX> bills at a fixed
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">um</ENAMEX> as far as electricity and telephone
 		um we do the same thing we budget not budget but um i have a long term savings goal
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		for retirement you know
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		they take out for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CODA</ENAMEX> and then uh um
 		the IRA's
 		and then uh i also take out for
 		um a savings account but it's it's uh
 		
 
 		um it's not really savings it's savings if we don't spend it
 	
 	
 		well i know yeah
 	
 	
 		it's like a floating you know if something if something comes up
 	
 	
 		yeah or if you want to take a trip or something that you you plan it but that's where you get the money is
 	
 	
 		yes
 		right yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah that's that's the way we work it
 	
 	
 		it it
 		it doesn't come out um
 		it doesn't come out of long term savings like we were we were um saving savings bonds too for oh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> and now i'm getting up towards retirement age so
 		we stopped stopped the the savings bonds and we're going maxed out on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CODA</ENAMEX> and then
 		you know other things like you know CD's
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um
 		but this other it's in the credit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">union</ENAMEX> and they and they take it out and it goes in there and at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the month</TIMEX> but if we want to go on a trip or if something looks good or if we want to go away for a weekend
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that's what we hit
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		or if we go out for dinner say to a nice restaurant
 		um that'll come out of that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		rather than put it on a credit card
 	
 	
 		oh that's sort of the way we you know do it or at least certainly for some of those bigger things or maybe one of the appliances breaks down you know and we have to go get something new then we've got that little cushion in there that
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know will either cover it or partially so you know depending on what it is
 	
 	
 		yeah so it you don't have to really dig into long term or or you know well you can't cash in a CD that's kind of ridiculous um
 	
 	
 		yeah no i never go like to go into those things that are
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		like you say long term that have penalties and all sorts of other things they
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh  i i sort of feel like if you leave it there and you don't use it and you sort of don't see it then it's it's safe in a sense
 	
 	
 		right the only time you know about it is when it comes due and they'll say you know well you've got to reinvest it back in this or that or whatever
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but yeah it's it's it's kind of forced on you
 		because you suffer a penalty
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so that's yeah that's one of the that's one of the ways that we do it you you also have uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CODA</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		definitely i mean that's a good deal
 	
 	
 		that's yeah where else can you get that kind of interest to start with
 	
 	
 		i don't know
 	
 	
 		i mean that's fantastic
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know they match it um
 		my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> used to they matched hers only hers was a little bit better than ours um she hasn't been working for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of years</TIMEX> her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> took sick so she's been taking care of him
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but that added up too i mean when when she left and the pay out came in you know if we just rolled that over and it just sits there and gathers
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		steam or momentum and you don't realize it you know it just
 		piles up
 	
 	
 		yeah that's a good deal well when you did keep a a budget all the time how strictly did you do that i mean was it real precise or
 	
 	
 		um yeah we we took out actually my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>
 		she's the one that ran the budget you know i just brought it home and she had to stretch it out wherever it was going to go but she would allocate so much at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">at</TIMEX> at that time when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> were growing up  so much went for groceries
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 		so much went for the mortgage because we knew you know that was kind of fixed and electricity you could come pretty close and telephone you could come pretty close uh the oil
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		we heated with oil
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		we they put us on a budget they would run like uh  they could really tell how much oil you were going to use
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so they budgeted it at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> round
 		so in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX> time
 		which you didn't use very little oil
 		you were still paying the same thing as in the winter time when you're using a lot but they kind of spread the payments out
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and
 		we stuck to that pretty much so uh groceries fluctuated um we didn't go out to eat that often
 		but as times went on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> got older you know and naturally salaries increased um we kind of fell away from it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it it became a chore
 	
 	
 		well it is to a certain extent to have to try to keep up with all that
 	
 	
 		yeah i talked to to uh
 		
 
 		other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and they used to have envelopes they used to stuff so much in you know so much for this so much for that so much for we never really we never really did that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		we just allocated so much and it went into a checking account
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the month</TIMEX> hopefully everything came out pretty close
 		so we just kept certain things out for like i said for groceries
 		um but even at that point you know she'd say oh you know we we need this or the budget's not doing this or that uh
 		course me i didn't run it like she ran it like you run it now
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		and it's pretty much the same she still does the same thing everything's fixed
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CODA</ENAMEX> comes out of your out of your pay and the credit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">union</ENAMEX> comes out of your pay
 		so we don't have to do anything there and the rest of it
 		as far as my salary goes i just have it automatically deposited in into our bank
 	
 	
 		yeah i do that too
 	
 	
 		so we don't really see anything if if i need something i'll go and you know use the teller machine or if she needs something she'll go and she'll use the teller machine
 		so we don't really um have a lot of cash anymore
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah i i walk around sometimes and i've got if i've got <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">five dollars</NUMEX> in my pocket that's that's a lot it's
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah i used to take money out for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">groceries</ENAMEX> and things like that and i don't even do that anymore i mean i just don't have that much cash on me
 	
 	
 		yeah for your automobile
 	
 	
 		um-hum right
 	
 	
 		you mean gas  yeah and now i don't know about down there but up here they got the pumps you just put your because i always put my <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> on a credit card and i pay it at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the month</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so you just stick your credit card in there and then it pumps whatever it pumps and it adds it all up and it gives you a ticket and off you go
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so you don't even have to go in to see the teller anymore
 	
 	
 		works pretty good then
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah it's not bad so you don't need you don't need money for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gasoline</ENAMEX> you don't need money you know incidentals
 		uh
 		for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX> when i come into work in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX> and things like that but other than that
 		um it looks like we're probably going towards a cashless society
 	
 	
 		yeah to some extent i guess so
 	
 	
 		because if you're doing that
 		you know and i'm sure it must be prevalent in your area down in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">um</ENAMEX> and we're doing it most most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> up here that work have already have their their checks uh electronically sent to their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX> or the credit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">union</ENAMEX> if they belong to the credit union
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so they don't deal much in cash anymore either
 	
 	
 		well
 		if we
 	
 	
 		so it looks like we're both running about the same
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um
 		maybe younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are different i'm not sure
 	
 	
 		yeah they probably don't have enough to  that's right
 	
 	
 		uh
 		they don't have spendable income right yeah the poor poor things i know like you know
 		i look at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mine</ENAMEX> and he's getting out of school and i'm saying geez you know i'm glad i'm not starting out now because
 		things are kind of tough up here for as far as uh employment goes
 	
 	
 		yeah we we're having some problems here too
 	
 	
 		still because you <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> ran into it a while back
 	
 	
 		yeah they're still laying off like over in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fort Worth</ENAMEX> and a lot of other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> too just here and there
 	
 	
 		uh
 		oh yeah it's not just yeah it's not just <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> they they're doing the same thing up here and not just uh in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX>'s newspaper they said um <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX>'s going through they're going to lay off <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">like fourteen thousand</NUMEX> world wide
 	
 	
 		well yeah that really is scary
 	
 	
 		
 
 		So it's still there unfortunately um
