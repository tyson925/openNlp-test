 
     		
 	
 		okay um i guess um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		this is probably really a good subject for me because i really like to do uh hand work uh mostly i do needlepoint i guess
 	
 	
 		oh really what kinds of things have you done
 	
 	
 		but um
 		um well i've made a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> gifts  it seem like that's like especially lately there's been so many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">babies</ENAMEX>  that uh bibs and blankets and things like that wall hangings
 	
 	
 		aha
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		do you ever keep any of your stuff
 	
 	
 		isn't that funny no
 	
 	
 		i do crochet and a lot of uh things like that and i have very little of my own stuff and it's kind of embarrassing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> say let me see some of your work
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		oh well can you go to so and so's house
 	
 	
 		yeah  isn't that funny i guess i do have one thing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> of mine gave me a clock kit and i i needlepointed the face
 	
 	
 		yes
 		ooh
 	
 	
 		and i uh kept that because she gave me that so
 	
 	
 		that that would be definitely something you'd want to keep was was the whole face done or just the numbers and and like minute
 	
 	
 		oh yeah and it's real neat
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">marks</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um  basically the whole well no i guess the minute marks but the minute marks are done they're like hearts
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and then the at the numbers they they're kind of outlined and stuff it it was quite bit of work but you know it was a lot of fun too i really like doing stuff like that so
 	
 	
 		i did some needlepoint <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX> and then i got into the Bargello
 	
 	
 		oh what's that
 	
 	
 		well it's an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> um
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">needlework</ENAMEX> using using the uh i started to say the canvas but the
 		uh hum the
 		what kind of cloth uses that i i've just gone blank but it's used with yarn and it usually takes long stitches over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two or three</NUMEX> openings in the cloth
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		and you weave intricate patterns and use different colors like it could be a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">flame</ENAMEX> stitch where so rather than drawing a picture you're making a design like a geometric or
 		whatever and it was used quite often in the colonial times to
 		uh uh to upholster chairs and so forth as well as the crewel um embroidery work that was done on them
 	
 	
 		wow that's interesting what did you what kind of things did you do
 	
 	
 		what i did when i was doing that was mostly pillows you know for sofas and so forth and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i can't find one that i've done it it's one of those things i didn't i didn't give them away but i didn't know if it's been my color choice or multiple moves
 	
 	
 		oh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		or or what and it i was so proud of them when i  got them finished
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but i have no idea where they are
 	
 	
 		what did you call that
 	
 	
 		bargello it's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B A R G E</ENAMEX> double L <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		huh that's i've never heard of that before i've probably seen it though i mean when you described it
 	
 	
 		i suspect you i suspect you have
 	
 	
 		yeah i mean when you described it it sounded like something you know that would be around i guess
 		but i've never heard of it before and it's really interesting
 		um i guess i've decorated baskets and stuff before in the past but i've kind of gotten out of that i use to do a lot more and sell at craft shows
 	
 	
 		me too yeah that's interesting
 	
 	
 		really
 		that's
 		yeah it is
 	
 	
 		how did you know to choose this subject <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">tonight</TIMEX> that's funny uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		how did you what kinds of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">decorations</ENAMEX> did you use with the baskets how were you decorating the baskets
 	
 	
 		oh basically bows and lace uh ribbons um i really wanted to do you know so many of them now have the ribbons where i'm not sure how they do it but the ribbons
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		they make them they like i don't know how to explain it they make them hard you know
 	
 	
 		like fabric that's been stiffened in yes
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i've never done that and those are so neat i mean i would really like to do those but
 	
 	
 		i've seen some and there there they i suspect they're fairly simple because the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX> i've seen i know that does it i've never asked her any questions but she has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> all under the age of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">like six</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		and and they're all a handful so it's got to be something she can do fairly easily and fairly quickly
 	
 	
 		oh definitely yeah
 	
 	
 		when i do um crochet it's usually the lacy Victorian type
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		things like that and i stiffen those with a a glue mixture it's like white glue
 		and it may be something similar to that that the fabric is dipped in and then
 		allowed to dry in those those draping bows i mean those draping streamers i don't know i was just there's bound to be some kind of fabric <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stiffener</ENAMEX> like that that's very similar that's not going to melt too much with uh
 	
 	
 		oh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh high humidity
 	
 	
 		that's i think that's what my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> was was it really sure and how they would how they would last
 	
 	
 		in in a room
 		do you know what my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> is how will i dust this thing  i'm terrible
 	
 	
 		you're right no that's true that's funny
 	
 	
 		so many of my crafts well right now i'm looking at a little uh
 		quilted uh uh hanging it's like it's a flag and i don't want to wash it because that would start breaking down the batting and so forth but it's such a dust <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">collector</ENAMEX> to be
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		out and so forth and most of my things are dust collectors  uh and i hate to dust so first thing i think of is how easy would this thing be to clean
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh i know
 		
 
 		that's funny  no i just um
 		i have really gotten out of it i don't do it quite as much as i used to
 		um i guess because i i went back to school so i don't have as much time
 	
 	
 		oh you don't have time
 	
 	
 		now and i have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> also  so that it keeps me very busy but i really enjoy it when i do do it when i get the chance you know it's really
 	
 	
 		you definitely don't have time
 	
 	
 		it's so relaxing to just sit and but once i get started i can't put it down i just
 	
 	
 		that
 		i have a similar problem i've got to have time or i don't even want to get into it in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> place
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and so i end up lots of time not doing anything at all
 	
 	
 		i know i started a project
 		it's been over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year ago</TIMEX>  that i swore i was going to finish for somebody for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> and i
 	
 	
 		you just didn't say which <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> right
 	
 	
 		that's what i keep telling this person well i didn't tell you what year
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		what was this project
 	
 	
 		um well it's a it's uh cross stitch and it's a picture and it's a wildlife it has deer and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> and it's really beautiful but it's going to be a lot of work
 		and you know i've i have worked on it quite a bit but
 		not as much as i'd like to you know it's just so hard
 	
 	
 		now this is done in the needlepoint
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well i shouldn't it's counted cross stitch actually is what i'm doing and so it's really since it's counted you know it's really a lot of work  yep
 	
 	
 		yes yes i do know i have done a little bit of that but i've decided that that's something that demands my time my my total attention
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and so i've got to have
 		total almost total silence i can't really watch television if the pattern is very intricate it sounds like you'd have lots of shading on that particular piece it is not does not sound like an easy <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to finish
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yep
 		no it really isn't and i tell you really  i could just kick myself for even  starting it because i have a feeling i'm never going to get it done i'm probably going to hear about it the rest of my life
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh
 		i'm sure you'll get it done but it just may not of the original obviously not of the original time schedule
 	
 	
 		
 
 		no that's true i i just don't know when i'm ever it just seems like there's just never enough time to pick it up and do it you know it's just really hard
 		but i really do en like i said i really enjoy it when i do it's just hard
 	
 	
 		just hard finding the time that can be dedicated to that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh</ENAMEX> and there's there's so many other things that i
 		i have done you know in the meantime like i said so many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> gifts i've made a lot of bibs
 		and wall hangings
 		and so you know those don't take much time at all so it's no big deal for me to pick those up
 		and do them
 	
 	
 		do you do you use patterns i mean like a book of patterns or do you go out an buy a a kit like for a bib or something like that
 	
 	
 		no
 		no i usually just buy a pattern book i have several pattern books and i just go with those
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		and then i buy the bibs separate usually i think it's
 		a little bit cheaper in the long run and then i just use whatever colors i want to i don't usually use the colors they tell me to and it it depends on what it is you know but some things especially letters
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		if they suggest certain colors for letters i just go with whatever i want to yeah i yeah
 	
 	
 		that's what i would do too
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		or whatever i have that's
 	
 	
 		there's yeah there's a few designs i guess i've done myself but not very many  real simple ones you know i do i've made i made a little uh
 		little uh little thumb print and made it a bunny
 	
 	
 		ooh
 	
 	
 		it was really easy i mean just
 		just did a thumb print you know
 	
 	
 		what
 		what with ink oh okay
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		and then see i didn't cross stitch the actual thumb print you know that was just the ink and then i made the ears and little eyes and nose and mouth that was so simple and it just it didn't take anything at all
 	
 	
 		oh that sounds really neat did you do did you use like a stamp pad an ink okay so you just
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		just like being finger printed
 	
 	
 		and then i just
