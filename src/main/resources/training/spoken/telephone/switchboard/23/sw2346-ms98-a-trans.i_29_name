 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and my other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son-in-law</ENAMEX> live in Germantown
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so
 		there
 	
 	
 		well you've got part of your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> up here then
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah so it's
 		interesting to talk to somebody from that general vicinity
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well uh i just got a new <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bird</ENAMEX> for uh little <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deb</ENAMEX> at uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas time</TIMEX> and we're still in the process of uh getting him tamed he's a little <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">parakeet</ENAMEX> yellow one
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh we let him fly around the house
 		and the dog being a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golden Retriever</ENAMEX> he he pays close attention whenever that <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bird</ENAMEX> is flying around
 	
 	
 		i wonder what he'd do if he ever got a hold of him though
 	
 	
 		well the the previous bird he uh got a hold of it uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two or three</NUMEX> times
 		and uh
 		i found that uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">well one</NUMEX> occasion i i heard a little noise and i saw the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> walking away and i looked over and i see some feathers sticking out of his mouth
 	
 	
 		oh oh
 	
 	
 		and i grabbed the dog by the tail real quick and i discovered if you yank a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX>'s tail real hard he lets go of a bird
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		next time you'll have to try a bigger bird
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		a bigger bird or a larger <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> to take care of the dog
 	
 	
 		
 
 		we have some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> that in fact the ones that we bought one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> from they also raise <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> and they have uh
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> different kinds of of parrots and then they raise finches and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">parakeets</ENAMEX> and they show
 		and he and he was showing me his <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">parakeets</ENAMEX> and and he calls them an <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> parakeet and he said their marking is a little different
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		have did did you know that there was a difference in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">parakeets</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		well there is a a neighbor of mine used to uh uh know quite a bit about uh raising <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">parakeets</ENAMEX>
 		and she had uh a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">connections</ENAMEX> when it came to getting good birds
 		so she was knowledgeable all the different breeds and colorations and so forth
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and knew what to look for when you went shopping for a parakeet
 		uh i had a parakeet <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many years ago</TIMEX> that uh she got for me
 		and it lived to be a a pretty old bird
 		and was extremely friendly
 		uh i i couldn't keep him in his own <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cage</ENAMEX> he just uh flew lose in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX> all the time
 		uh but uh more <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX> they moved away and i've been buying <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">parakeets</ENAMEX> at the local pet shop
 		and they don't seem to be as healthy as uh one's you get from uh breeders
 	
 	
 		you might check uh some of the ads in the paper and see if anybody has an aviary that you might be able to buy from there
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that seems to be an up and coming business i know out there where we are there's there's uh a person on each side of our
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">county</ENAMEX> that now have aviaries
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of them is right out there close to us they're in the process of building it up right now
 		i know
 	
 	
 		well we found in general when you you look for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">breeders</ENAMEX> you don't find them in the uh metropolitan areas
 		they you wind up going many miles out of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> to find somebody that's handling whatever it is you're looking for
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		we went looking for uh rabbits
 		and we had to go all the way out to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leesburg</ENAMEX> to find uh a rabbitry <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few years back</TIMEX>
 		weren't any uh rabbits available in this area except little bunnies available at the uh pet shops
 		and we looked at them and decided they weren't uh too healthy looking
 	
 	
 		yeah that's the problem with buying them through the pet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> we have that same problem here too
 		yeah but we've used it we just have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> rabbits right now we have one doe and one buck
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and she ought to be due <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sometime</TIMEX> toward <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of this week</TIMEX> on a litter we just got her
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		the uh
 		we go we had uh one doe that we'd had
 		her
 		let's see it was her <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> litter i guess the first litter she had she lost all but three
 		uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">babies</ENAMEX> and we raised those and then her <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> litter
 		she wound up killing all of them
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		and it took her like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three days</TIMEX> i guess before she killed all of them so we've we had to get rid of her
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so i i
 		wouldn't tolerate that
 	
 	
 		that's pretty unusual because we i've generally found that rabbits have been very uh very good parents
 	
 	
 		yeah well this is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time we've ever had one like that we had been down we had
 		gone from having one buck and and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> does down to one buck and just one doe
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but that didn't work out too well so now we're we're trying to build it back up
 	
 	
 		yeah we had a rabbit up until uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last summer</TIMEX> and we gave him away because the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> lost interest in him and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> of them we're getting allergic to rabbits
 		uh
 		i uh we had a tough time deciding on a name so i named him uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mister Tibbar</ENAMEX>
 		and they wanted to know how i figured out that name and i said well it's rabbit spelled backwards
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so uh
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of my other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughters</ENAMEX> got a uh gerbil and they came to me for a name and i said well name him Libreg
 		and they said well how did you get that name i said well that's gerbil spelled backwards
 	
 	
 		now that's a good idea
 	
 	
 		well they wouldn't let me name the dog
 	
 	
 		no that one would might get you in trouble
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah unless you called <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">it Dog</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		we have been known to do that in the past we've we've got a couple of wild <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> out there in our general vicinity
 		and you know they're they're tame enough that they come up and want you to feed them but they're not tame enough that they want to stay around or come in or anything so
 		you know those are just <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Big Cat and Little Cat</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah well we had uh i lived on a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">farm</ENAMEX> when i was growing up and when we bought the farm there was uh couple of farm <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> on the property
 		and they were sort of tame every <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">now</TIMEX> and then they'd let you pet them
 		but uh one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> which we named <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bug Eyes</ENAMEX> she had a litter of kittens and she kept t hem away from the uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX> until they were pretty good size kittens
 		and they wouldn't let you get anywhere near them
 		and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX> i went over to i found them sleeping and i went over and picked one of them up and it boy it was like picking up a buzz saw
 	
 	
 		huh
 		
 
 		i bet it was that they do that you know they they have kittens out there in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garage</ENAMEX> or out in the barn
 		and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time you try to get around the kittens you know it's you'd have to catch them with a
 		uh a fish net or something because they scamper away so quick
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		but i tried again <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few weeks later</TIMEX> but this time i put on some leather gloves
 		and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> still wondered what happened to those leather gloves
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		did you in
 	
 	
 		well it's been nice talking to you
 	
 	
 		well it's been very nice talking to you i appreciate having the call
 		and uh maybe we'll speak again on this little test that they're trying to do
 	
 	
 		all right
 	
 	
 		okay thank you bye-bye
 	
 	
 		bye
