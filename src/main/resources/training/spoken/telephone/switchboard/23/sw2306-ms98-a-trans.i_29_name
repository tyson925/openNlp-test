 		yeah uh um i've watched <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Murder She Wrote</ENAMEX> a couple of times but um i like mysteries and i do like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Columbo</ENAMEX> but there what is opposite <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Murder She Wrote</ENAMEX> there's something else that i watch i think it's that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> home video show
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		well the
 	
 	
 		that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Famous Home Video</ENAMEX> is what's opposite it here i don't know up there but um i like that because it it really makes me laugh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> send in have you ever watched that where they

 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">huh-uh</ENAMEX>
 		oh what kinds of things do they uh show
 	
 	
 		oh gosh well uh one that comes to mind is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX> i don't know what the heck she was doing in her dishwasher but she was in her dishwasher her head was in her dishwasher and her hair got caught
 	
 	
 		oh my word
 	
 	
 		and she couldn't get out and her hair it was and she was heavy kind of like me  and so what you could see was this big bottom sticking out of her of her dishwasher and her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> was
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		say he was videotaping this thing you know there she is caught in the dishwasher you know oh it was hysterical and
 	
 	
 		oh my word
 	
 	
 		just real funny things you know <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> skiing and doing funny things on in the water and you know just really it's it's really a good program i really enjoy that
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		probably things that that there happen <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX> and we don't even notice them until someone videotapes them
 	
 	
 		i know it and then some the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">winner</ENAMEX> the one that's voted the best wins ten <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">thousand dollars</NUMEX> so you know
 	
 	
 		is that right
 	
 	
 		i often think gee i wish i had a video camera because i could sure use <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten thousand</NUMEX> dollars so but i like things like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Evening Shade</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Burt Reynolds</ENAMEX> i really enjoy that and uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah i saw that for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first time yesterday</TIMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the evening</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		i really like that that's a good show and i like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosanne</ENAMEX> now i know not many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> probably like <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Roseanne</ENAMEX> but
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah uh i have never seen her show but after hearing her sing the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Star Spangled Banner anthem i</ENAMEX> will never watch her show
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well she doesn't sing on her show but i i do enjoy seeing that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh so i like a lot of comedy stuff i guess you know but then i like the police things too Cops you know we have
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh yeah right um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i like that you know so i don't know i guess i just like a variety variety of things and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX> i just tape <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Regis</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kathie Lee</ENAMEX>

 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		but every i run my VCR while i'm at work i tape that and i watch it every <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</TIMEX> when i come home and i don't know what it is about that show that's different about other talk shows
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well i think that they uh they seem like they are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> with one another and with all of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guests</ENAMEX> rather than just interviewing
 	
 	
 		yeah and she's so cute and her and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank</ENAMEX> and the baby and i don't know i just you know they took it off down here for a while uh oh gosh for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about a year year</TIMEX> and a half well
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 		did they
 	
 	
 		yeah i guess <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about a year</TIMEX> and so i missed her pregnancy and everything you know and when they took it off i have never called a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX> before or complained or anything when they took it off the air here i called the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX> and complained i said
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you took my favorite program off the air and do you do you think it'll ever be back and they said no we don't think it will be well that was channel <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eleven</NUMEX> and now it's on channel <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so i'm really thrilled at you know that they you that they have it here so
 	
 	
 		well great
 		course i have to admit i i love uh when the fall comes i love uh football
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and i watch all the football games <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> does too i'm not a big i used to be a football <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fan</ENAMEX> i don't know what happened i'm just not a football <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fan</ENAMEX> anymore
 	
 	
 		well and not everybody is
 	
 	
 		yeah but my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> does not miss a game and you just don't know she lives in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> and i do not call her on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">football during football</ENAMEX> season i just don't do it
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know she might call me during a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">halftime</TIMEX> or after the game or something but i just don't call her and now they're starting up with new football
 	
 	
 		yeah but uh i can't get too enthused about it yet it seems to me i have to feel that the fall weather to really do something uh with regard to football
 	
 	
 		it's
 		you think it's seasonal you think it goes with the season
 	
 	
 		yeah i because i always hate to see it end in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January</TIMEX> i'd like to see it go on for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of months</TIMEX> but football to me uh in real real hot weather it just doesn't uh doesn't click now i enjoy
 		going to <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">baseball</ENAMEX> games but i don't enjoy watching them on television and i don't enjoy watching <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">basketball</ENAMEX> on television they're they're both well <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">baseball</ENAMEX>'s so slow
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh basketball seems like all all that you can really see is run and shoot run and shoot run and shoot  and um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> because the average <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> doesn't get to see enough of the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX> to see a play get uh develop develop
 		and so uh uh i don't usually watch them i'll listen to <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">baseball</ENAMEX> and i'll listen to uh like the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Indianapolis Five Hundred i</ENAMEX> would not go and face all those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowds</ENAMEX> for anything in the world
 	
 	
 		but you watch it
 	
 	
 		but uh but uh no i won't watch it i'll listen to it on the radio yeah while i'm doing something else but i won't sit still long enough to watch them go round and around and around to me that is very boring
 	
 	
 		oh listen to it
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but i i don't watch i don't sit and watch for long periods of time anyhow
 	
 	
 		now see in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX> you really have <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four seasons</TIMEX> don't you
 	
 	
 		yes we certainly do
 	
 	
 		well we kind of do but ours  our it its hot here i'm in shorts
 	
 	
 		
 
 		are you
 	
 	
 		and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have their air conditioners on already it has been hot and humid here and so but our <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summers</TIMEX> sometimes start in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June</TIMEX> and they don't end till like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November</TIMEX> i mean it's hot so we watch <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">football</ENAMEX> in the heat here
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		sure right i guess so
 	
 	
 		so i it might not matter <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Texans</ENAMEX> are real football minded people
 	
 	
 		um oh with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dallas Cowboys</ENAMEX> although they haven't done very well <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last couple of years</TIMEX> but uh they'll be back up there
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh well i know
 		i think so i think they did better this <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> so
 	
 	
 		yeah they'll they'll climb back up again and that <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Texas Stadium</ENAMEX> i've been there that is a phenomenal place
 	
 	
 		yeah <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> say they wish they had a roof on it though it doesn't look finished
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well and i think that's maybe what i like about it in that so many of them are totally enclosed
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i've never been in an enclosed one
 	
 	
 		oh i well i have and they're very noisy
 		and uh then of course i've been up to uh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cleveland Ohio</ENAMEX> where the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cleveland</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Browns</ENAMEX> play and that's just a wide open <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stadium</ENAMEX> and that cold wind comes off the lakes and it is miserable oh
 		but um now go down to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cincinnati</ENAMEX> and they have a nice <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stadium</ENAMEX> down there but it's it's all open also
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah so <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX> has how many football <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two</TIMEX> well so does <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texas</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> yeah
 		yeah and then of course <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indianapolis</ENAMEX> which is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only a hundred miles</NUMEX> away from us has the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colts</ENAMEX> yeah
 	
 	
 		that's right they have the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colts</ENAMEX> now like
 	
 	
 		so uh they  they've got a lot of sports going on around here
 	
 	
 		yeah i went <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time to um okay <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minneapolis</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>

 		oh yeah
 		oh yeah
 		well i uh
 		i'm retired from education i
 		worked <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty four years</TIMEX> as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">administrator</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dayton</ENAMEX> here this the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dayton</ENAMEX> school system

 		yeah
 		yeah
 		oh
 		oh sure one of them was grown up and was <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chief of Police</ENAMEX> here
 	
 	
 		oh that must be neat to see what happens to them like that
