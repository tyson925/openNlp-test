 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		do you have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> are <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three twenty nine and twenty five</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		and i uh am spending more time with my <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty five year old</TIMEX> because at this point he happens to be single and always has been single and living at home uh while he's trying to uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 	
 	
 		find a nice <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> and get married  they're little right right they're a little hard to come by so anyway he's still here uh
 	
 	
 		that's a hard process isn't it
 	
 	
 		the only thing i can say about the raising of these little things is that my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sons-in-law</ENAMEX> seem to be so much more involved than my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> ever was or the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husbands</ENAMEX> of our age group
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		uh-huh i'm kind of at the other extreme i have a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nine month old</TIMEX> and one that will be born in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh how wonderful we had uh an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fifteenth</ENAMEX> May
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh really
 		yeah that's when my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nephew</ENAMEX>'s birthday is and he goes well you should have it on the fifteenth so we'll see
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah  well my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>'s is on the fourteenth so we did miss that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a few hours</TIMEX> there but we didn't care at that point so
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah at it's that close
 	
 	
 		so do you find your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> more involved than your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> was with you
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i he definitely i had an unusual situation with in my home my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> was was alcoholic but uh and very withdrawn at that and so my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> times more involved and we have more of a
 	
 	
 		um
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh i guess a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> based home and so we try to make the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> as important as we can
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> and i guess you don't have to have a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> based home to to feel that way but that's just part of our priorities that's right  it certainly gives you some some specific specific goals to work towards but uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christianity</ENAMEX> doesn't hurt us any does it
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		he helps a lot with her he helps feeding her changing her and playing with her and
 		and i think he has to be conscious of of uh needing to spend time with her if not then he gets wrapped up in the TV and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX> and whatever else and he says oh i didn't spend time with Emily
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but if he forgets i try to to help him remember
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh</ENAMEX> and perhaps <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Emily</ENAMEX> will when she's a little older
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i think so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh how do you find uh with an alcoholic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> how do you find how what effect do you think that has on your life as an adult
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i think uh i've been reading a lot lately about the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alcoholics</ENAMEX> syndrome i don't know if you've heard of that or not
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but uh trying to relate that to me and i think because i had a strong <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> background personally it affected me differently than it affected my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sisters</ENAMEX> and i see myself uh with some of those qualities but with not quite as much anger
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		as i see them towards him or towards my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> with certain things and uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		as far as me personally i think
 		it made me appreciate my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> more because he doesn't do certain things that my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> did so i
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		uh-huh the reason i'm asking is because i have a dear dear <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> was alcoholic
 		and at fifty she and she was an only child
 		at fifty she's still still having a lot of difficulty in her relationship with her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> that she feels stems from how she was treated by her father
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and how she feels that she has to control everything and from her readings she feels that that comes from the fact that her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> was alcoholic over which of course she had no control
 	
 	
 		uh-huh i think that's that's how i feel too i feel a need to dominate certain things and i try real hard not to be to too domineering with with Emily
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		because i don't want to my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> was also a domineering type of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personality</ENAMEX> because she had to take over the things that my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> fell short in
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i find you know i think okay i want <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Emily</ENAMEX> to be this way and this is what i'm going to do to make her be that way and then i think no you can't do that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		she has to develop her own personality and so sometimes i i have to step back and say okay we want to encourage her we want to influence her but we don't want to control her
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and so far it hasn't been too hard but she hasn't been making a whole lot of decisions on her own yet and so you know i guess i'm i'm just going to have to be real conscious of that as i as she gets older and does start making decisions
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and be conscious that i need to give her options but not make the decisions for her
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh</ENAMEX> and you don't feel that your relationship with your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> has unduly uh influenced your relationship with your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> then
 	
 	
 		um i i look at myself and i have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sisters</ENAMEX> there's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughters</ENAMEX> in the family i look at myself compared to my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sisters</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		and see that one of them married an abusive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> one of them married an alcoholic uh the other one married into a pretty stable relationship
 	
 	
 		uh
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mine</ENAMEX> is pretty stable or much more stable i think probably than any of them but now i waited until i was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> to get married and they all married at eighteen but uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		you didn't need to get away from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> then
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um
 		well my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> in his <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">alcoholism</ENAMEX> he was kind of irritating and it there were a few times he was violent towards my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> but it was almost he like
 		if he had any opinions to give he would tell my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> and she would tell us and so we had almost no direct relationship with him i mean he was there and and we you know did little things together as a family but on the whole there was no
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		no direct communication no show of affection no even no show of anger unless it he was you know really really drunk
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> was like that but that was because he was working all the time establishing a business and running it certainly he i mean he got off work and he came home
 	
 	
 		oh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and he ate dinner and his work was outside and in the winter time by the time he was warm he was asleep so it wasn't that he was
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		neglectful of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> by choice there just was no time and energy left for them by the time he put in his workday which started like at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five thirty</TIMEX> and ended at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six thirty</TIMEX> uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">alcoholism</ENAMEX> wasn't a problem resentment whatever was was not a problem at all because each <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> was planned and he seemed to be the one who initiated having <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> so certainly he wanted the m
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		he just didn't have the energy to deal with them and of course now uh he's very excited he's retired and he's spending time with his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandchildren</ENAMEX> which shows how much he wished that he could have with his own
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah i see my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> relating much better to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandchildren</ENAMEX> than he did to us
 	
 	
 		so he has overcome <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">alcoholism</ENAMEX> at this point
 	
 	
 		
 
 		not completely no he he still has a problem with it and he goes in stages
 	
 	
 		oh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but he still you know he will pick up my one of my granddaughters and say you know give her a hug and say i love you and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time he said i love you to me was when i had been away from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">almost a year</TIMEX> and a half
 	
 	
 		oh
 		but he said it
 	
 	
 		yeah it i said i love you <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> i miss you and then he said was able to say it back and and i was <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty four</TIMEX> and that's the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time i'd heard him say anything you know similar to that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 		the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time i heard my older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> tell and she is our most expressive tell my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> that she loved him he said well i certainly hope so
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um
 	
 	
 		so he but then he came from a background where he is so much more open with his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> than his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> was with him
 		his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> was just a very quiet withdrawn <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> and i assume very shy as is my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh he shows his feelings but he cannot express it and i think that's kind of sad in a way i see other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fathers</ENAMEX> put their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX> around their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughters</ENAMEX> or their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sons</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		we have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughters</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> and uh he just can't do that and i i know that he would if he could and i i kind of feel sorry for him because i think he misses a lot and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		as i say our our sons-in-law are so open and caring and giving to their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and i wonder if it's because they're there when they delivered they're delivered if that
 	
 	
 		they went through that entire process yeah
 	
 	
 		right if that maybe starts in the delivery <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> that my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> missed out on
 	
 	
 		uh-huh i think too that with us as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> being out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">home</ENAMEX> where i'm not working now i didn't work until <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about</TIMEX> from about the time Emily <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about four months</TIMEX> before she was born
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and but so many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> are having <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and returning to the work field that the the dads
 		you know have to to follow through or a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> has to come in and follow through with with the the care and the dads are are doing more
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and that bond is starting you know like you said right at the beginning and then developing it's not breaking at any point
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		at least it shouldn't <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">and and and</ENAMEX> and in a good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> it isn't unfortunately there's so many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> where there isn't a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> in the home it's just yeah that's right yeah
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh</ENAMEX> or a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> some of them the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fathers</ENAMEX> are raising the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah so
 	
 	
 		it's certainly not a good situation but i'm sure it's not one that the the the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> chose i mean i'm sure they felt they had no choice at our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stage</ENAMEX> in life we've seen
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		a lot of our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> go through divorces uh you know we've been married <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty five years</TIMEX> and so that's how old our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> are
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and they're on their <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> marriage and they've got his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> and her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> and i think my gosh all the pain they've caused themselves and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> i just
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know of course everything wasn't always rosy for us but you know we stayed together and at this point our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> are saying gosh i'm glad you did that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so i think it makes for a more solid basis for them or i hope so at least
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah they see you go through the problems and still come out okay working together
 	
 	
 		um-hum and they see that with my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>'s retirement a little over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year ago</TIMEX> we're having a wonderful time and i think they look at that and and uh and that way i think we're doing a lot for our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandchildren</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yes yeah well that sounds good my background is in sociology and so i see a lot of unwed mothers
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
