 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		all right
 	
 	
 		okay well um we lived i grew up in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Antonio</ENAMEX> and i was used to the heat and i was used to what couldn't grow
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		down there and uh
 		we had a small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">um farm house</ENAMEX> out in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Castroville</ENAMEX> which is just uh to the west of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Antonio</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and we did a lot of gardening out there and uh mostly in raised beds so we could keep the uh soil nice
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		because basically out there it was mostly a clay soil very hard to to grow very hard to cultivate
 		and when we came up here uh to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> uh we're in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Monterrey</ENAMEX> area and it's very uh nice sandy soil rich soil
 		and the weather is perfect for growing just about anything you want to grow
 	
 	
 		how fine
 	
 	
 		so we've been out here well really in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December</TIMEX> and we've been uh planting <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> that we could never <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Antonio</ENAMEX> uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		because the heat would just dry them up after you know about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three good weeks</TIMEX> of nice weather before the heat started
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		and here they are supposed to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> around so we have some really pretty <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> growing and uh we're at the edge of a forest area so there's a lot of pine mulch
 	
 	
 		oh boy
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh  just about anything you would want in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gardener</ENAMEX> is here just around us you know
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		we got here at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of about a four year</TIMEX> drought
 		uh we've had a whole lot of rain uh it's been raining pretty much continually now uh off and on maybe <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX> of break for about a month
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		so yeah we're getting replenished and so there is uh
 		when i <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> came here everything was yellow the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">grass</ENAMEX> was dead everywhere
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and now with all the rain everything is just gorgeous lush and green and beautiful and i hope that it holds out here after the summer
 	
 	
 		hm
 		wow
 	
 	
 		but uh that has been the major change that we have noticed in gardening and that's about the extent of what we've done just a little bit on the patio and
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> and waiting for the the rain to subside so we can  mow we after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about a month</TIMEX> we finally got to mow <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this weekend</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but um we're just so happy to see green it's just so nice we haven't really done too much else other than that
 	
 	
 		hum
 		well we um we just moved to our <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> home and we had lived in a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">condominium</ENAMEX> before so
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		we didn't have any lawn and garden type duties so we're just learning the ropes here and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but when we moved in um our backyard has so many big tall <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> in it that there just there wasn't even a blade of grass in the backyard
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so we're you know going talking to some of our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> that are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">landscapers</ENAMEX> and things and learning about different kinds of grass we trying to go grow grass and it just seems so funny to me
 		that when i grew up in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Missouri</ENAMEX> and you didn't have to worry about growing grass there it just happened automatically
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		so do you have to get a shade tolerant <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">grass</ENAMEX> is that what you're
 	
 	
 		so
 		yes we are we tried we planted some fescue last um fall
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and it's it's really really pretty and um  green it stayed pretty pretty green throughout the winter
 		and uh
 		and it's pretty good it's not as thick and as nice it doesn't look like it can withstand too much you know
 	
 	
 		oh okay does that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last through the summer</TIMEX> too
 	
 	
 		it's supposed to die off like in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August</TIMEX> and then you replant it in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		um
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		so but we don't the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint Augustine</ENAMEX> and all that supposedly was back there just wasn't like i say there really wasn't even one blade of grass in the backyard
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and um
 		so mostly you know we're not even to the point where we're getting into <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> and flower beds or even gardens that
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		we're just saying let's get some grass
 	
 	
 		just get grass to grow i know
 	
 	
 		let's get grass so that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> can play in the yard and not have to be worried about the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dirt</ENAMEX> so much you know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		well when we had our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> um out in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Castroville</ENAMEX> the problem with ours is that the uh plots there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a third</NUMEX> of an acre and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		trying to keep grass alive during a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> on a piece of ground that big was expensive
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		to water it and uh and eventually well especially when it was so bad <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> well i guess it was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> before now uh it was so hot <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that year</TIMEX> that was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> that i think it started out <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh no
 	
 	
 		um we were just watering all the time finally what we did was we said we're going to have to let the back yard die it's going to have to do whatever it's going to do because we can't really afford the front yard
 	
 	
 		
 
 		on its own
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and so when we left you know the back yard had
 		and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint</ENAMEX> um i think it was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint Augustine</ENAMEX> that we had um it it had held onto a small portion but primarily once the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">weeds</ENAMEX> start in the back
 		yeah we were just you know resigned to well the only way we were going to fix this one is that if you plow it all under and put everything back on top of it again
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		hum
 	
 	
 		but i don't know that's the bad thing there is that we spent so much money or you would spend so much money trying to keep a large lawn alive
 		that was the only thing i didn't like about <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">lawns</ENAMEX> and we were sitting there wondering there must be a better way to landscape so that you don't have to spend so much money trying to keep the lawn alive and green and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">weeds</ENAMEX> out
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yes and
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		it's pretty remarkable because growing up we've always had a beautiful lush green lawn and we never there was no such thing as watering your <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">lawns</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Missouri</ENAMEX> i mean it just happened
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		
  
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and um so it's been real fun here to see there's a big market for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">nurseries</ENAMEX> and for the landscaping <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> and a  lot of people
 		um we live in north of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> and um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arlington</ENAMEX> area
 	
 	
 		Plano
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">okay Plano</ENAMEX> uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh up north and um
 		and so there's a lot of market up here since it's kind of the area that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are moving into in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> area and big market for
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		for <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">yards yard</ENAMEX> work
 	
 	
 		yeah i imagine so well everybody it seems like everyone is so particular
 		especially in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> area there there's so much money and everyone can afford they have enough leisure time to afford a nice lawn and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		another thing i've noticed is that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">lawns</ENAMEX> in some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> the area is so small that they take great pride in being able to use whatever lawn they do have to look really nice
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 		yes they do i noticed that they're really putting in small back <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">yards</ENAMEX> because they have these most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> have the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">alleys</ENAMEX> that run behind
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and so that really cuts into your backyard space and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but we don't do our work here out of enjoyment so much just
 		right now we're just this is we just moved in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">in September</TIMEX> so we're just still at the point where we're talking about the
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		the necessity
 	
 	
 		right i know oh it's it's awful the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house well</ENAMEX> the our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Castroville</ENAMEX> was the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> one too
 		and we had no idea the expense that <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">lawns</ENAMEX> and gardening  would run into
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and the time that it took especially when you start mowing and then when it comes to fertilize then it would come to raking and then when it comes to making sure that somebody had put the timer on the water
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and the one thing that i did notice is that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that have the underground irrigation systems the sprinkler systems just that was the way to go if you could do it <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that were building the new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> that put those in
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that was
 		that was the only way to go because it was just so convenient they would just turn it on and the timer would run and it would water their lawn and they didn't have to worry about it at all
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		and that was so nice but we didn't have that luxury so we were dragging the the sprinkler around everywhere and uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so i hope you can find uh i don't know what type of grass grows in uh the real shady areas i remember the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> that was on the radio
 		um they had a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gardener</ENAMEX>
 		and he i don't know i had this one well i've still got the book it's um i think it's just called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Texas Gardening</ENAMEX> and it talks about the different grasses to use for the shady areas versus the really sunny areas
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		hm we
 	
 	
 		and but there is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">grass</ENAMEX> that you can use that is shade tolerant but i don't remember what it is but it's got like a boot on the front of the book
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it's just a real fancy decorated boot it's like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texas Gardening</ENAMEX>
 		and it talks about you know different problems that your <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">lawn</ENAMEX> can have and how to recognize it and it goes into the full gamut of gardening you know everything from <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">bulbs</ENAMEX> to perennials to grass to <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">weeds</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> and to uh how to prune
 		but <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the things i do remember was when it talked about the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">grass</ENAMEX> and there being the shade tolerant types of grass and i think one of them was a blend of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> types of grass that they had used
 	
 	
 		grass
 		oh
 		um
 	
 	
 		but i don't remember i don't remember if it was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Raleigh</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint Augustine</ENAMEX> or or what but i do remember they had used a blend
 	
 	
 		or what it was
 		well we're going to have to do that because we have the shade the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> this is an established and older <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> that we moved into and um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> are just so tall and there must be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> or twelve big tall <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> out there so that
 		like even if its raining you can  go out in our back yard and not get wet
 	
 	
 		oh
 		but that's so neat because so many <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> don't have that so you'll be cool <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all year</TIMEX> around in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX> that's great
 	
 	
 		well that's what we're looking forward to and that's what they say the payoff is but
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		it makes the biggest difference
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		when you have the big old trees
 		and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that moved in next to us they built a new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> on the empty <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lot</ENAMEX> and they just had their brand new little trees They didn't have any shade  they any time they had <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> over they had to do it on the patio because it just got too hot during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the day</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		too hot yes
 	
 	
 		so oh that's great that you have them are they oaks that around there
 	
 	
 		well there are all different kinds there
 	
 	
 		oh that's even better
 	
 	
 		you know there are some <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">oaks magnolias</ENAMEX> and like plum <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees peach trees</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		there are some big
 		big tall <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">oak trees</ENAMEX> one across
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
