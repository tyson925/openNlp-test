 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		are you a player
 	
 	
 		uh i like to think i am it's it's been a while now
 	
 	
 		is it
 	
 	
 		yeah i've uh
 		oh just recently i got married and we bought a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> we're about fifty <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">yards</NUMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">golf course</ENAMEX> but unfortunately the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> is taking up my time
 	
 	
 		um
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so it's been uh it's been almost a year i guess since i've actually uh swung a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">club</ENAMEX> for a purpose
 	
 	
 		yeah i haven't i haven't played in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about two years</TIMEX> and then i went out <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks ago</TIMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> here i work at <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> and i played in a tournament out there and i shot a net fifty <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> they were kind of little upset
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but i guess i laid off long enough to get rid of all my bad habits
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		i have a hard time inventing shots you know let's go around this <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> and you know try a slice through a hook here and i can't do that so i i finally got out and i've been watching quite a few videos i
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 	
 	
 		hadn't been able to play so i took out a few videos and watched them for a while and i
 		i hope i'm on the right track you know i shot a career low <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">eighty nine so</TIMEX> and my handicap's <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty</TIMEX> i
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that's that's great yeah
 	
 	
 		i like the
 	
 	
 		no it's uh i could say it's been a while for me too i uh i've got my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> motivated about it um
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		and uh i think that's probably going to be one of our next investments is get her get her a set of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clubs</ENAMEX> and uh we'll get out of the driving range and and get some interest built up and hopefully we can uh we can start in
 	
 	
 		yeah i've tried to get my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> i bought her a set of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clubs</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four years ago</TIMEX> she hasn't even swung them but she wants to get into it now after i came home and won the tournament <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the other day</TIMEX> she's
 	
 	
 		really
 		well great great that's good
 	
 	
 		she's ready to get off into it but you know i like i just like getting out being in the outdoors and i'm a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hunter</ENAMEX> and a fisher anyway but you know i i you know at least i can get out and play <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a few hours</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">golf</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		yeah same thing here
 	
 	
 		it's not going to cost me an arm and a leg really
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		and i you know i walk i don't ride so you know i get a little exercise there too so
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah
 		that's i've got the same attitude i uh
 		i tell you i i started i guess the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time i played <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">golf</ENAMEX> has been probably <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about eight or ten years ago</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">now</TIMEX> when i was in college
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh i took uh took it as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PE</ENAMEX> course and then kind of left it alone for a while and then finally got got into it when i was while i was still in school
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		since then uh we've made it um as as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> start getting married and things like that we've made a tradition of uh having a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a Thursday</TIMEX>
 		or well have have probably like a like a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bachelor party</ENAMEX> and a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX> golf <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX> before the wedding
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh so it that's back in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Dakota</ENAMEX> where i grew up and uh so that that's uh that's been my main my main involvement is it seems like i go home and play <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">golf</ENAMEX> more than i do around here but uh
 	
 	
 		oh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		eventually i get <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to come and visit me in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> and then i'll show them that we can play <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">golf</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the middle of winter</TIMEX> when we can't do it back home
 	
 	
 		yeah it's pretty nice we played out here a couple of times in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the middle of the winter</TIMEX> when my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> came down and what not they were amazed
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know here it is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixty five</TIMEX> degrees we're out playing <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">golf</ENAMEX> and they're freezing cold back there so
 	
 	
 		yep yep
 	
 	
 		but i uh i  i picked it up when i was in high school at on the same as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PE</ENAMEX> course and then when i got into the service i got into it
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		and then when i come out here i just kind of let it go and then one of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> mentioned to me at work <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX> if i played golf i said well yeah you know i've got my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clubs</ENAMEX> but i haven't swung them in quite a few years
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and then i got into it and then back out of it and it it just seems like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every couple of years</TIMEX> i get back in there
 	
 	
 		yeah that's right
 	
 	
 		you know i really enjoy it it's really nice
 	
 	
 		oh it is it's it's a lot of fun especially especially if you can find somebody that's uh that's got the same level of interest that that seems to be the hardest thing well about that's that's that's true of any sport you know if you want to play <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">tennis</ENAMEX> or
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah you don't want to go out and get beat to death but
 	
 	
 		racquetball
 		right and and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> don't want to play with somebody that they're going to beat every time you know and and uh and
 	
 	
 		no
 		and then you know we've got some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> here they're you know <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four and five</NUMEX> handicappers and they don't like to play with me because i'm too slow for them so
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know but get somebody around your own handicap and you can just mosey on out for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">four hours</TIMEX> and have a good time
 	
 	
 		that's right yeah
 	
 	
 		and i've you know i've never yet never yet have i walked up now i've walked up a few times on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">golf course</ENAMEX> by myself with nobody else to play with and never yet have i met anybody on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">golf course</ENAMEX> that wouldn't allow me to join their
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">twosome</ENAMEX> or threesome you know they're always friendly sure come on out you know and they don't mind if you make a mistake they don't mind saying well you know let me teach tell you how to do that or teach you how to do that or
 	
 	
 		that's true
 		that's true
 		well
 	
 	
 		you know it's it's pretty nice and friendly out there and you can't find that in all sports
 	
 	
 		that that that's uh
 		yeah that's absolutely right and you can gain a lot of ground doing that too if you
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		you you know you you get stuck you get in a rut if if you do play a lot but you play with the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> you you aren't going to learn anything uh after after a short period once you learn everything they've got to offer then uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah you need to
 	
 	
 		you know you've basically tapped your resources there
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh i'd i'd like to uh eventually i'd like to work work up if if my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> does get interested and and maybe get involved in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">league</ENAMEX> in a in a mixed mixed doubles <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">league</ENAMEX> or something like that
 	
 	
 		oh yeah we  we have one down here in the summertime uh it runs from like <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five o'clock</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven thirty</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">eight o'clock</TIMEX> you know because it doesn't get dark until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nine thirty</TIMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		right
 	
 	
 		and we play in the summertime out here we get a mixed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">league</ENAMEX> in and that's what i'm trying to get her ready for it's going to start well when we change the time back whenever that is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next month</TIMEX> i guess
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and it'll start then and you know we had a lot of girls out there <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of years ago</TIMEX> and they were just starting to learn and you know they were shooting <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred a hundred and</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty</TIMEX> but they were
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		you know now they're down into the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> nineties nineties nineties so it won't take her long
 	
 	
 		right
 		well that's good that's good that sounds like a lot of fun
 	
 	
 		you know
 		and it's something we can do together so
 		well she doesn't do much hunting she could care less about that she does a little fishing but you know golf would give her the exercise she'd be outside give her something to do that we both enjoy so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah it it sounds like we've got real similar situations uh i i go home uh i've gone home <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every year now</TIMEX> since i've moved to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> to to go pheasant hunting and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um the the last time i i took my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> along and uh kind kind of the same situation she sat she sat in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and talked to my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> the whole time we were out hunting and stuff but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		she'll definitely uh she'll make the trip for fishing if we if that comes along but uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		all right
 	
 	
 		it's uh that's interesting though
 	
 	
 		yeah and it's you know it's a game that you don't  like bowling you know you feel bad if you bowl <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred</NUMEX> but if you shoot <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred</NUMEX> in golf you know you don't have to be an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX> to play any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">novice</ENAMEX> can pick up a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">club</ENAMEX> and learn how to hold <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> and learn how to do it and do it right
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		that's right
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so you know you don't have to be an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX> in any aspect of it at all
 	
 	
 		that's right well yeah that's i've i've kind of formed the attitude that you know if if i could just if i could pick <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two or three</NUMEX> shots out uh
 		out of my game every time and put them together on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> hole then i do pretty good and then and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i keep i keep rationalizing that well you know i i can do it i i just got to do it all at the on the same hole and and then it'll get better and you just keep going and in the meantime just enjoy what you're doing and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it it it really works that way
 	
 	
 		and when you know when i <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> got back into it i used to get mad because i knew i could do something and i didn't get it done you know and i just well i need to slice this ball around here i naturally slice anyway
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		now you know the ball'll go straight and i go  i never broke a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">club</ENAMEX> or anything but you know i'd get upset about it sometimes and now i guess you know being in my forties i just kind of mellowed out a little bit i don't get upset any more so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		sure
 		sure
 	
 	
 		and
 	
 	
 		yeah that's great
 	
 	
 		well i enjoyed talking to you
 	
 	
 		well you bet
 	
 	
 		i guess i'll go back to work
 	
 	
 		okay sounds like it
 	
 	
 		all right see you later bud bye-bye
 	
 	
 		okay bye
