 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		okay uh
 		are you in the market for a new car
 	
 	
 		uh
 		i've only purchased <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> in my entire life
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		right
 		and that was back in nineteen fifty <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and it was a new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX>
 		so the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">automobiles</ENAMEX> that that i have uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of all we have a source now we got a a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> whose a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nun</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and we've been purchasing her <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> she buys a brand new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every three or four years</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		and then when she gets ready to trade it in she offers it to us and we buy it
 	
 	
 		well well that's great
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		if you if you can find a deal like that
 	
 	
 		yeah and uh we've got we've got a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixty seven Mustang</TIMEX> that we bought brand new
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and we still have that
 	
 	
 		oh that that that's a classic car
 	
 	
 		so yeah it's going to be uh let's see <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</TIMEX> i guess it will be an antique
 	
 	
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		but the problem with it is up here around there's so much <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX> on the roads
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		that it's hard to keep <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">automobiles</ENAMEX> for any length of time because they all rust out and
 	
 	
 		huh
 		i bet that's right i bet that i bet that is true
 		for down well down here we don't have that problem
 		of course
 	
 	
 		yeah uh every once in a while though uh i'll read a blip where you <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> get some
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh terrible ice storms
 	
 	
 		oh yes we get and then
 	
 	
 		but they don't put <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX> down there then
 	
 	
 		they sand the roads
 		and it just turns into a big mess
 		
 
 	
 	
 		ugh okay
 	
 	
 		so uh but really the when it when it gets uh nasty down here it's like a big huge fender bender parking lot
 		so i just try
 	
 	
 		nobody nobody goes anywhere no one will
 	
 	
 		nobody goes anywhere
 	
 	
 		
 
 		okay so how about how about you how about purchasing an automobile
 	
 	
 		well uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple years ago</TIMEX> we we purchased an uh well it wasn't new it wasn't new it was a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a a an</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Astro</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">van</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		we really like it because we got uh a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two year old</TIMEX> and another <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> on the way
 		so uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		we  we had a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Firebird</ENAMEX> and we had to trade we guess we got to get rid of this thing because there's no way we can haul <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> and junk and  stuff with that  so we got rid of that and
 		we're really pleased with it
 	
 	
 		yeah so what do you buy what are you looking for you look for an automatic you know you look for something with all the
 	
 	
 		yes i can't drive a standard
 	
 	
 		you can't drive a standard
 	
 	
 		no i can't drive a standard
 	
 	
 		yeah no i used to when i was when i was uh younger
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know but i've it's been long gone out of my system now i could just put it in home and let it go there and take me there and that's it i don't like any of that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but i do like comfort i like uh uh we have bigger automobiles now we've got Pontiacs
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh i like the comfort you know and and the mileage we get is depending on if it's tuned up or not we get <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between eighteen and twenty two</NUMEX> miles to the gallon uh
 	
 	
 		that's good we
 	
 	
 		you know it's not really all that that doesn't it's it isn't as good as some of the smaller ones you know that they get <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a zillion miles</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh oh yeah but yeah uh that's not one of my first priorities when i'm looking for a new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> is excellent gas mileage
 		look
 	
 	
 		you what what do you look for uh ease of handling or roominess
 	
 	
 		well my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> has to have a has to drive a pick up so that's so he has his he has a pickup
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		uh he drives a small uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S GMC S</ENAMEX> fifteen  which we bought we bought new <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five years ago</TIMEX> and have had real good luck with i mean there's have absolutely no trouble with it
 	
 	
 		yeah that's i i had a pickup <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">truck</ENAMEX> in fact i had i had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> the last <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> i gave to my uh uh youngest
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh
 		because we used to go we we we uh built our home and we built it to we designed it to be heated by uh wood you know uh uh wood stove
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so and i like the i like the warmth and the comfort of it so
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every winter</TIMEX> well i used to go out and chop <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wood</ENAMEX> and get it all ready for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next season</TIMEX> so a pickup <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">truck</ENAMEX> was handy for the work i was doing around
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		but now everything's done so
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i figure instead of doing that i'll just i'll just order <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wood</ENAMEX> but
 		uh
 		
 
 		uh i'm just like you gas mileage wasn't a priority
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		it was it was comfort and it has to be has to have air
 	
 	
 		oh yes
 	
 	
 		so down down where you <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> are
 	
 	
 		down here it's a it's it's it's a necessity
 	
 	
 		it's a necessity yeah
 	
 	
 		when it gets to be a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">hundred degrees</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a month</TIMEX> and a half
 	
 	
 		yeah that's i had i had gone down to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">couple weeks ago</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		it's
 	
 	
 		uh on a seminar for a week
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and that's when you broke all the records was up to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">like ninety six</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah it was it's pretty warm
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eighties</ENAMEX> and you know when i left here and we're down to the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirties and twenties</TIMEX> and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so it's a shock
 	
 	
 		so i can see you yeah and you need air you actually need air now
 		it gets warm enough down there for it
 		so
 	
 	
 		yeah i've i've in the car i've been running it
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh uh uh uh</ENAMEX> because it
 		but uh the the weather the weather's just been really nice but i mean you you just can't sell a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> down here that does not have air conditi oning in it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		like we're from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Missouri</ENAMEX> and when we moved
 	
 	
 		oh are you
 	
 	
 		we when we moved down here the our uh the vehicle we had did not have air conditioning and we went through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one summer</TIMEX> that way and that was it  that's when we traded it
 	
 	
 		so that's that's one of your priorities there's got to be air has to be an automatic
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		uh how about uh accessories power windows and all that
 	
 	
 		oh that's not really important the the other stuff is just you know window dressing because we we've never ordered anything fact the the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">van</ENAMEX> that we've got we bought uh
 		from an estate it was an estate trade uh it was almost brand new the the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gentlemen</ENAMEX> who owned it had died
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		so we got a really good deal
 	
 	
 		so you got a yeah
 	
 	
 		and it's loaded i mean it it i mean if i would have went to buy that thing new  there's no way i could have afforded it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh since it was a state vehicle  we got a really good deal on it but it
 	
 	
 		so if you know if you know where where you're get getting your your <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">automobile</ENAMEX> from
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's best to buy it that way because like our sales tax up here is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> percent
 	
 	
 		oh it's it's <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">eight percent</NUMEX> it's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> here
 	
 	
 		it's <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">eight percent</NUMEX> down there
 	
 	
 		yes yes
 	
 	
 		so who
 		so if you go out and you're talking like a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fifteen thousand</NUMEX> dollar vehicle and you add that sales tax on that's a that's a big chunk of change you have to come up with
 	
 	
 		yes it is it
 	
 	
 		and then we have an excise tax up here too i don't know if you have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every year</TIMEX> down there
 	
 	
 		oh no
 	
 	
 		so they take the they take the uh whatever the book value of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicle</ENAMEX> is
 		and then whatever your tax rate is and they just tax you <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every year</TIMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicle</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicles</ENAMEX> yes it's terrible
 	
 	
 		oh how awful
 	
 	
 		and in our <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> we live in a like a rural area
 		and they have a fire tax that they add on too
 	
 	
 		oh how awful
 	
 	
 		so so we've got to pay a fire tax and we got to pay you know two taxes
 		sounds like you got a a little one there
 	
 	
 		oh she hit her she hit her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX>  now she's fine so
 	
 	
 		oh
 		so once you buy a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicle</ENAMEX> and you pay you pay the sales tax that's it they don't tax you on it anymore
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh uh property tax the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> but uh since we moved out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> we don't have to pay property tax on it anymore
 	
 	
 		so that's what they consider property tax it's like like if you own your own home you have to pay property tax
 	
 	
 		right <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">homes vehicles</ENAMEX> you know everything
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		has everything like that gets uh taxed property uh property tax
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		even if you you know if you don't own it yet it if you're paying off a note you still have to pay property tax on it
 	
 	
 		i still have to pay it yeah that's just like up here too
 		it's like that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mustang</ENAMEX> that we have
 		the excise tax on it <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every year</TIMEX> there's a minimum you have to pay and and it's only twelve dollars
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so we've got an automobile that's that's got some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> to it but i don't really i can't tell now what kind of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> is coming down or what kind of a car i'm following unless i get up close enough to read the name on it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		because they all look the same
 	
 	
 		yes everything look that's it i don't i don't foresee buying us buying an <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a</NUMEX> a vehicle anytime in the near future because we're very pleased with what we've got plus i don't like anything that they've come out with
 	
 	
 		yeah and if you take care of it i mean you can get
 		uh some good mileage out of it
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		because of the the i'm driving a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pontiac</ENAMEX> now
 		and it's uh it's a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">sixty seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pontiac</ENAMEX> it's got a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">hundred fifty eight thousand miles</NUMEX> on it
 	
 	
 		ooh wee
 	
 	
 		
 
 		and it's absolutely gorgeous just i mean just glides along and i still get that good mileage and
 	
 	
 		well that's great that
 	
 	
 		i take it back and forth to work
 		and then my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>'s got a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a an eighty four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parisian Pontiac</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and that's a big car it's a V8 four door
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and that's got uh
 		a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">hundred and sixteen thousand miles</NUMEX> on it and that runs perfectly well too
 	
 	
 		well that that's great you got a hold of a couple of vehicles uh really good vehicles
 	
 	
 		so when we get like i said you know the next <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> when she decides to to sell the car she has now i'll end up with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parisian</ENAMEX> and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> will have the newer one of course and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so we we just been doing it for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> and years
 	
 	
 		well down here if you want to go buy a used <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> it's impossible because they want just as much for a used <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> as they want for a new car
 		and it it it just does
 	
 	
 		that's incredible
 	
 	
 		it just doesn't make sense to buy a used <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> down here
 	
 	
 		yeah if you're going to pay the same amount of money and and you don't really know where it came from
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		then you're buying somebody's headaches probably
 	
 	
 		oh you have no idea where it comes from you don't
 	
 	
 		it's yeah and there's no warranty
 	
 	
 		no none
 	
 	
 		so whatever happens to it you're stuck with it
 	
 	
 		yes true
 	
 	
 		unless you buy it from i say somebody you know you know like from a family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> or a like that one
 	
 	
 		yeah
