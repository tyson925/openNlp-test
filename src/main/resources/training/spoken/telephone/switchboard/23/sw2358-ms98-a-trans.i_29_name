 		do you cut the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">grass</ENAMEX> and stuff

 		well we both do sometimes
 	
 	
 		you both do it that's nice
 		do you have um a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> and stuff
 	
 	
 		well we're we're moving to a new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and so we'll we'll have to get started over there
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		decide what we're going to plant and everything at the at the old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> we had a lot of roses
 	
 	
 		um those are pretty
 		i i used to have a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> that had a really it was really well landscaped and i i enjoyed the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> and the and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> the things this
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">house</ENAMEX> doesn't have very much it has some trees but um who lived here before didn't put in anything in the way of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">shrubs</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> but i think i am going to have that done
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		have that done this year because i do enjoy looking at it i just
 		i'm not i don't tolerate the heat well
 	
 	
 		
 
 		it does get really hot here
 	
 	
 		i much prefer to stay in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> in my air conditioning and look at it without working in it
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		although i have i did try <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one year</TIMEX> um out here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> but i lived i used to live in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Antonio</ENAMEX> and i did try growing having a garden where i grew <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tomatoes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetables</ENAMEX> different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetables</ENAMEX> and that was kind of fun
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		to get out and work and that
 	
 	
 		we tried that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> and but we hadn't lived here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> for you know long enough to
 		to remember that you have to do like um i have this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> who lives in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> and she plants her garden in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January</TIMEX> harvest in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> again in um <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late September</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		ooh
 	
 	
 		and then harvest like in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December</TIMEX>
 		yeah that's right because the summertime you just can't grow anything and we tried to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">like end of March</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX> and everything just toasted i mean it just
 	
 	
 		isn't that when when are you  i thought that was when you were supposed to plant
 	
 	
 		oh here it gets so hot i mean this stuff just burns to a crisp what
 	
 	
 		when when are you supposed to plant it
 		when when are you supposed to plant then
 	
 	
 		probably <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late January</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		right when it just as soon as it stops freezing
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i didn't realize that
 	
 	
 		because you know i mean <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last summer</TIMEX>
 		the only way you could keep something keep a keep a garden growing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last summer</TIMEX> was to water it <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all day long every day</TIMEX> and because it would just it would just burn to a crisp
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		it does eat up the water eats up your water bill i know that
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		but um
 		i don't know i've i
 		
 
 		i just prefer having someone else do it to me um you know i'd rather spend my time doing other things
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i know my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> always enjoyed it he loved to work in the yard
 	
 	
 		why did he make you do it
 	
 	
 		uh he made us do the grunt work
 	
 	
 		well so okay you need to get married and have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> and then when they're big enough you can have them go do the yard  and you can do what you want to do
 	
 	
 		that's what he i can't tell you how many times i heard that
 		that's what he yeah i i can't tell you how many times i heard that
 		and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> only my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> only <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> so he's not old enough yet to send out to to the do the yard work
 	
 	
 		
 
 		no but he will be
 	
 	
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about five more years</TIMEX> maybe but um i don't know i don't know really
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it's interesting i don't i don't know part of the reason i think is that i don't know anything about it when i had my other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and it was already landscaped and i
 		you know i didn't know what to do and how to take care of the things and you know i learned a little bit but um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i heard roses i heard that <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">roses</ENAMEX> are really difficult to grow and they really take a lot of
 	
 	
 		well i i didn't seem to have that experience i mean they were already there but we just fed them and watered them
 	
 	
 		you did you have any problem with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bugs</ENAMEX> or anything like that
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		well that's good have you have you ever grown any <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetables</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh well like i said we tried <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> but we didn't do it right
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">um tomatoes tomatoes</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		and it's going to be too late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> by the time we get moved so we'll probably wait and maybe in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fall</TIMEX> we might plant a fall garden this year
 	
 	
 		yeah  um
 		hum
 	
 	
 		but we're not going to try to do anything during the summertime because it is just too hot
 	
 	
 		it's an interesting
 		i think it's an interesting you know it's an interesting hobby if um you know to have i just have never taken the time to learn to learn very much about it and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know but like i said i don't tolerate the heat and the
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		some of it's fun but the cutting of grass and i just don't enjoy that
 	
 	
 		yeah that's what i said you know <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> during the summertime you've got to get up at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">six o'clock in the morning</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh i see
 	
 	
 		to do it before you know before it gets hot and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one time last year</TIMEX> i remember we were planning on doing that and it was eighty degrees even then
 	
 	
 		at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">six o'clock</TIMEX> yeah yeah i know
 	
 	
 		oh it was just awful
 		and so humid
 	
 	
 		have you had to start your work on your <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">yard</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> yet cutting it and stuff
 	
 	
 		oh no because were fixing to move

 		really
 	
 	
 		so it's getting to be i i usually have it done about every other week
