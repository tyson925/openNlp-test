 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay so do you all keep a budget
 	
 	
 		no we don't
 	
 	
 		you don't
 	
 	
 		no i i make so much money here at <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> that that we just spend it
 	
 	
 		well
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and we never have a problem meeting it from paycheck to paycheck it's pretty neat being that independently wealthy and working for a major semiconductor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX> you can just spend it well
 	
 	
 		are you being smart or are you serious
 	
 	
 		i'm being facetious i'm being very comical uh we have a budget um that works well i kind of look at it for more of a we have a financial uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> a finance <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">administrator</ENAMEX> i guess that that uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i guess the financial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planners</ENAMEX> the training now we've had it for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about four years</TIMEX> here got our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX> and and and our life in line how to manage credit cards how to put away say for you know money markets and this kind of thing
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and there's some freebies out there are you should put <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> to fifteen percent of your <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</TIMEX> bring <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> in some sort of savings account that being money market uh bonds coda <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mat</ENAMEX> savings uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		or a listed liquid account which which we do um you should always have <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three months</TIMEX> of your salary in a savings account in case there's a major need for that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		okay you should always have an umbrella permit that <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridges</ENAMEX> your uh life insurance and your medical and your um um car insurance in case you run into a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> and you break his arm he's going to sue the pants off of you
 		these kind of things are about a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">hundred dollars</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> so you you know these are all equivalent to the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</TIMEX> budget things some of them are there to pacify situations and some of them are there to prevent things from happening
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but uh i guess we kind of got away from about the last <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixteen months</TIMEX> as far as saying <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">two hundred dollars</NUMEX> for food and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">three hundred dollars</NUMEX> for this and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two hundred</NUMEX> for that because we had a a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> which is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about a year old</TIMEX> and then uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		we've just been kind of
 		working on i've been developing it but it's kind of hard diaper prices are going up you know and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">formula</ENAMEX> and stuff you know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		that's funny yeah we have a we're <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty eight</TIMEX> and he's been working at <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five years</TIMEX>
 		and that was pretty much his first really really major job of any you know professional because he'd worked you know part time during school and what not and uh he was a little late graduating so we're
 		you know uh and we have a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a half year old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> and it's because you know we were eighteen when we had him so we're we're kind of looking at this from the other aspect of
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		we you know we have a lot for to be our age and you know just everything and having the responsibilities we've had on us for at such a young age you know we have a like a nice house <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> you know are really shocked at how nice everything is in our house
 		but we don't you know live in a brand new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX> either maybe an <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eighty ninety hundred thousand</NUMEX> dollar house we live in a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty year</TIMEX> old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> that would probably sell for <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">forty five thousand</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so you know we have trade-offs so we're more we have a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</TIMEX> budget with this this this this but we have no savings which isn't real wise but
 		we just we don't have the income at this time really to have any because we have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> debts that we're trying to pay off from both of our student loans we're still paying trying to pay those off
 		and we have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> car payment that we don't i think we have about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirteen months</TIMEX> left on it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and after that we either what we want to do is begin doubling up our <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> payment
 		um they'll pay  our <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> payment is equivalent to both of our student loans so what we want to do is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</TIMEX> keep driving the same cars
 		and um pay on the student loans split that car payment in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> and pay you know double up payments on both our loans and it'll work out perfect
 	
 	
 		do you have your uh loans through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texas Credit Union</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		no we don't
 	
 	
 		okay thing about the credit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">union</ENAMEX> is it's the way it's set up is if you have
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">thousand dollars</NUMEX> left let's say on on the loan if you go up there and write them a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">two thousand dollar</NUMEX> check it doesn't all go towards principal
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		they take out for the for the finances the finance charge which is kind of you know it's like one of these lose or swim type of credit one of those loans is not really the best in the world but
 	
 	
 		um
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but you know they're they're uh since your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> is is is um a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TIer</ENAMEX> but doesn't have the loans with the credit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">union</ENAMEX> they're offering something that might be worth taking a gander at i don't know what your percent is on your on your <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> payments
 	
 	
 		really
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but they are they'll take any <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> non credit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">union loan</ENAMEX> like if you have a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fourteen</NUMEX> percent loan for a new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> they'll take it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and refinance it and put it with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texas Credit Union</ENAMEX> at i think it's a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten and a quarter</NUMEX> percent
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		which is not a bad deal one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretaries</ENAMEX> we have down here is paying twelve percent through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GMAC</ENAMEX> or something
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and she's doing it i mean it's not like it's like
 	
 	
 		does she have to pay to have it refinanced
 	
 	
 		i think they even cover that because they want you as a they want the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TIer</ENAMEX> to be part of the credit union
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TIer</ENAMEX> to
 		see we got ripped off buying our new car we both come out of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">uh drugs</ENAMEX> and stuff and we became <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christians</ENAMEX> about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five years ago</TIMEX> right when he got hired for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> right before he got hired for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> he had uh gotten saved and stuff
 		and so i mean when you get come out of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> and stuff you have nothing i mean you know you don't have anything
 		you have the clothes on your back and you might have a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> and that kind of thing and so when he when he started working at <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> we uh you know we really felt like God told us to buy a new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> because he had an older <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> that was going to need to be fixed and high gas
 		but we got ripped off on it because we wanted it financed at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four years</TIMEX> and we were young and we'd look about nineteen <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> still think we're about they ask us where we go to high school when we get our hair cut and stuff both of us
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and so it's just kind of strange you know so <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five years ago</TIMEX> we probably looked like real ding dongs you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so we went in and the financed the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> and we didn't know that we got kind of taken just a little bit so we're kind of upset that we're having to you know pay <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this fifth year</TIMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> because it was just not a wise thing but we learned a good lesson so
 	
 	
 		well <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five years</TIMEX> is not that uh you know <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five years</TIMEX> is not that bad of a problem only because you're paying more interest but your um payments your payments are lower
 	
 	
 		you know
 		yeah but they they would have only been about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty</TIMEX> dollars <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a month</TIMEX> higher
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		and he want yeah he just told me this <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX> that he he said don't you remember i asked them to finance it at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four years</TIMEX> and they came back and they said that they had it figured for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> and we'd already signed the papers
 		and i maybe i might have been there i don't remember hearing that but i also wasn't the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> in charge of it so i wasn't paying as close of attention
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		but anyway instead of putting our foot down about it we just went okay whatever you know so anyway so next time we'll do that different we want to next time pay cash for our <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> too we want to pay cash for everything we can possibly do when we buy a house
 		we attended a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Guathier</ENAMEX> financial seminar and he has a lot of wisdom on that just on Biblical you know principles to finance he runs a big the largest real estate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fort Worth</ENAMEX> debt free
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and we really believe in debt free living and debt free <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> buying and debt free house buying and if we do take out a loan on a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> in the future what we'll do is pay twice a twice <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a month</TIMEX> on it and because you save a lot in interest just doing that
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		and then
 	
 	
 		you save a lot
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		if if if if and you need to be very careful
 		if the loan is set up to have <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">bimonthly</TIMEX> they call it a yuppie loan if it's set up for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">bimonthly</TIMEX> payments if you because you'll <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sa ve seventeen fifteen</ENAMEX> to seventeen <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> off the end of the loan seven i'm sorry <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven to nine years</TIMEX> off the end of the loan
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 		right
 	
 	
 		and there are there is a local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX> that'll actually if if like in my situation i don't have that because the loan was not available
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i can have this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX> will pick up my loan for a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">six hundred fifty dollar</NUMEX> fee so i can cut that much off the end of but i'm not interested because we're moving out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> next year
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yeah but uh those are all great the the interesting thing we're getting ready to have a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> built
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		is it's not a lot of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX> that offer mortgage mortgage loan <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX> aren't offering um that loan
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i mean you can ask and you can wheel and deal but it's not as open as it it should be it's a great idea hell i'd love to cut ours in half but uh man
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and if you figure get with a financial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> and you can figure up exactly when like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the eighteenth month</TIMEX> of a loan if you make like a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">four hundred dollar</NUMEX> payment
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		over and above your <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> payment it'll make uh it has a magic with numbers it i it'll shave almost you know <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> number of dollars off
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		right yeah we real we've become aware of that we have a there's a loan <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> through our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> too that i think could help us better you know he does that full time with the bank you know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and so we're going to use <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that we're in a relationship with that we know that you know we know are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of integrity so
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		you know that is another thing that you know we feel like our long term goal is going to be benefitted by next time we buy a car we're not just going to go to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toyota</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Irving</ENAMEX> you know we're going to go to somebody that we know we're going to take someone with us older and we didn't do any of those things
 	
 	
 		somebody you trust you know there are so many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rip-off artists</ENAMEX> here in this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> it's it's uh it's really a sin it really is
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i got taken on some firewood on firewood
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		i mean uh uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> shorted us <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a half</NUMEX> a cord of firewood and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> didn't know and i stopped payment on the check and he'd already been paid by a cashing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX> and and they're suing us they're suing me on this and it's for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a hundred</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty four</TIMEX> dollars
 	
 	
 		oh my
 	
 	
 		absolutely pathetic
 	
 	
 		i stopped payment on a check oh that's funny
 		oh this <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX> we bought a sewing machine at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zak</ENAMEX>'s and then i found that you could get the same machine better for less locally not much less but it was enough less and i found they locally serviced it
 		and we just stopped payment on the check so i hope they don't sue us over it  but we never received any merchandise either so i don't think it would hold any
 	
 	
 		oh okay well something probably something like that did you call them and tell them you just you just
 	
 	
 		anyway
 		no we didn't even call them we just did it maybe my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> should call today
 	
 	
 		might be a good idea because because you're going to get what a a check uh
