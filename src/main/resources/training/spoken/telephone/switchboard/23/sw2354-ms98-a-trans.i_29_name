 		so anyway i've been taking enough <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">zinc</ENAMEX> you know  to kill a horse probably  i hope it doesn't hurt me but anyway  i did read <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> chapter of that
 	
 	
 		there's a uh a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> called um oh i'm going to forgot his name now uh Dirkson

 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh i forgot <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sally</ENAMEX>'s last name
 		anyway it's a couple i've i've seen them on TV
 		and uh they have they are pretty down to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">earth</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about uh</TIMEX>
 		what you can take and and what you can't take and um
 	
 	
 		the quantities and
 	
 	
 		the quantities what are good for you what isn't and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">um Life Extensions</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		what's the name of it again
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Life Extension</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh yeah he's probably <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about forty</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years old</TIMEX> now i saw him probably <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven years ago</TIMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Johnny Carson Show</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		uh-huh oh really
 	
 	
 		and uh i was pretty impressed he had a he before he started out on his experiments he had a battery of tests done on his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> to determine the age of each <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of his organs
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know based on how well it was performing and then he embarked on this uh vitamin treatment and then <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every year</TIMEX> he had the same tests run
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and at the age of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty two</TIMEX> i think it was his <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">um heart</ENAMEX> was that of a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fourteen year</TIMEX> old
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		and all the rest of his organs were all greatly you know all tested out greatly below his actual age
 		and of course <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sally</ENAMEX> uh isn't a very big <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> i mean she's you know she appeared to me to be very petite and um she took a horse shoe and and turned it turned it into an S
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		and uh it was all from taking the right vitamins and things that that give you the strength and of course doing isometric exercises
 		uh together they both exercised <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about five minutes</TIMEX> a day doing isometrics rather than you know physical strenuous exercises
 	
 	
 		really
 		i know there's not any <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> that you can get
 		and it's grown on good soil hardly anymore and i know my my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">uncle</ENAMEX> owns a big some acreage in a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Eastland Texas</ENAMEX> which is in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Texas</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and he owns a lot of acreage that's been farmed properly you know and uh we get black eyed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peas</ENAMEX> off of it and stuff but
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		i know that you know the further we go from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adam</ENAMEX> the worse the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> is for you but God still somehow makes us all
 		be able to still live i think it's a miracle we're all still alive after so many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX> well the last <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> of processed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> you know i mean but
 		i don't know i like to i like to my i like to be able to eat really healthy you know what am saying and i guess i'm going to have to wait for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the millennium</TIMEX> i think though because i do don't think we're going to restore the earth to you know i think <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus</ENAMEX> is the only one that can make this earth be restored to what it should be
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but uh in the meantime we pray over our <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> because i'm always looking down my plate and i think <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> isn't this stuff was probably grown in who knows what you know kind of environment but
 		i do take some vitamins on the side and i do like reading books like that i just
 		i have a hard time a lot of the books are real new age oriented like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mother Earth</ENAMEX> and we're going to restore the earth i just don't see that i think
 		i mean think to think that is almost it's hopeless to think that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> can do anything with the you know what i'm saying it's to big than us and i think God's in charge and God's going to restore it when he wants to so sometimes i get bogged down in the
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		you know in the ideology that motivates a lot of health food and motivates a lot of vitamin taking but you know there's a balance in it sometimes i read stuff like that and then i just chunk off like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> off your back some of it and
 		you know and try and do what's what i can do out of it that's practical but anyway so
 	
 	
 		yeah there's i've i've read a lot of things um since i got involved in the water <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX> back in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eighty three</NUMEX> um and it's amazing that the the legislation they have
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> that doesn't apply to water they don't consider water a food and uh the basics premise is that if <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> was a food it would be you know they wouldn't be able to sell it to you
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		through your pipes because it's toxic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">um chlorine</ENAMEX> it's toxic it's a i don't know if your on city water city <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> has <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chlorine</ENAMEX> in it chlorine causes <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		because it's what
 		oh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		they know that they've proven that
 		um yet their saying well we're putting such low doses in there that well you don't have to worry about dying from it the problem is that i've that i've read books that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh have proven that there is a link between the ingestation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chlorine</ENAMEX> and arteriosclerosis which is heart attack
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um
 	
 	
 		and if you look at the history of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart attacks  heart attacks</ENAMEX> were nonexistent prior to nineteen <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		and we started doing um large quantities of chlorination of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> starting around uh where we experimented with it in nineteen oh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> and nineteen thirteen most of the major <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> had chlorinated water
 	
 	
 		really you know i bet that's why we have some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> that eat only i just took this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Amish bread</ENAMEX> out of the oven <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> it's going to be good i had a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">starter</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> of mine made anyway uh i had a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> that read a book on that
 		and um i've all my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mom</ENAMEX> you know you probably read Back To <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eden</ENAMEX> or something i don't know  we read a lot i know <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have read all those books but
 		the um they drilled they drilled a well i don't know how many feet but it's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three or four</NUMEX> times deeper than it needed to be
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and so their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> comes out they live in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Grand Prairie</ENAMEX> but it's they live kind of in a the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX> go right over from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DFW</ENAMEX> so it's not real developed and so they have a probably <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> an acre
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm very familiar with the area
 	
 	
 		and yeah and they drilled this well and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> comes out at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty two</TIMEX> degrees so  it's kinds of neat would that be healthier do to do that to drill your own fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> well like that
 	
 	
 		it depends a lot of uh a lot of things were thought that uh as you know the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX> thought okay we got chemicals we're putting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemicals</ENAMEX> on the field well the ground will naturally filter out the
