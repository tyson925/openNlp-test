 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		well Bonny
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		how do you do your budget
 	
 	
 		well
 		we take the rent first
 		you know we need to have a roof over our head
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and then we take the car
 		you know we need a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> to get back and forth to work
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and then it's the utilities
 		and then the food
 		uh
 		and then uh the regular bills
 		you know your credit cards and your uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">utilities</ENAMEX> and stuff like that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh
 		i i'm trying to think what else phone the phone <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utilities</ENAMEX> come last or uh before let's see the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utilities</ENAMEX> come before the food and the bills
 		the uh credit card you know the credit cards and what else is there that we pay you know we got loans
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		things like that they come before the uh uh they come after everything else
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		they're last on it because you know uh they
 		they're never late but they're the least uh bothersome uh bothersome to us you know uh we need a roof and all that before we need anything else
 	
 	
 		yeah i kind of think you ought to make make them wait until the last possible minute for it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		we do ours uh fairly similar course uh we both have married before
 		and uh so what what we do is kind of divide up the bills based on who makes the most money
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and whoever makes the most money course takes the most you know the biggest part of the bills
 	
 	
 		yeah well i'm a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homemaker</ENAMEX> myself so he he brings home the money and we just divvy it up the way it
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		should be and
 		or the way whatever way we can
 	
 	
 		i wish we could do that unfortunately
 		between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> divorces it kind of it kind of taps you out pretty good
 	
 	
 		i can imagine i uh you know i haven't gone through a divorce myself i've only been married once but uh
 		i know a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that have and a lot of them's got alimony and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> support and all that
 	
 	
 		oh yeah it that takes a big hunk out of your budget it costs me about uh <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">three thousand dollars</NUMEX> a year for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> support
 	
 	
 		yeah i bet
 		
 
 	
 	
 		which is after i mean that's net that's right after i pay the taxes and stuff on it
 	
 	
 		well that's better than having them living with you
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		they're more expensive right there day in and day out
 	
 	
 		that's what i hear although although i kind of miss some of that stuff
 	
 	
 		yeah i bet you do
 	
 	
 		yeah but you know you know bills wise uh we kind of divide everything up and i take i take the bigger portion of it and uh my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> takes some of hers
 		and we have an agreement that uh if we're going to charge anything over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">like seventy five or eighty</TIMEX> dollars then we uh we talk about it
 	
 	
 		yeah oh well me and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		unless of course it's uh it's like for a present or whatever
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and we have snuck some pretty good size presents in here
 	
 	
 		i love it when my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> decides to say fudge with the budget and uh sneak a big gift in
 	
 	
 		yeah i uh i was trying to finagle our budget around because uh my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> wanted
 		she really wanted a little small <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">five inch</NUMEX> TV she could carry around the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> or you know back in her sewing room whenever she's watching television
 	
 	
 		i've got <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of them
 	
 	
 		and she wanted one so bad and we were just kind of short on money
 		and so all through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> i i was putting you know <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five or ten</TIMEX> dollars back <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fifteen</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty</TIMEX> whatever i could spare i was putting back in a little envelope in there
 		i was hanging onto it i thought God you know come <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> time we're going to have that television set come hell or high water
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and sure enough we got it
 	
 	
 		well uh my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother-in-law</ENAMEX> gave us one for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas a couple years ago</TIMEX> i don't think it's <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">five inches</NUMEX> i think it's a little bit bigger than that
 		but it runs on uh car batteries and you know stick it in the lighter and runs on regular batteries and electricity
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so it's a neat little thing to have
 	
 	
 		how how do you divide uh you just divide up your uh the money just you just make a deposit in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX> and kind of go from there huh
 	
 	
 		uh well they have we have direct deposit that helps a lot
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> and uh
 		<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> thing he does is we get out our clipboard we got everything on a clipboard <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">from now</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three months ahead</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and uh you know he makes the same amount <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every week</TIMEX>
 		uh he's not it's not salary he gets paid by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the hour</TIMEX> but we know exactly to the penny how much he's going to get unless he works over and then it's
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh you know that's extra uh but
 		he's got us situated to where we pay uh pay <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two or three</NUMEX> of the big ones at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the beginning of the month</TIMEX> and then all the little ones at the middle of the month
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh none of them's ever been late you know the ones that come in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the middle of the month</TIMEX> are early you know we pay them like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks ahead</TIMEX> of time and uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it works out real well uh
 		most problem we had was when uh
 		let's see when was it
 		something like we had a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> pay uh weekends
 		uh you know it was a late uh uh the long pay period
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh we was close to being uh
 		oh shoot i'm trying to think it's been so long uh it was when he was in the military and uh
 		it was something like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four weeks</TIMEX> in between pay periods and it really blew everything away
 		uh we was close to being late on a lot of stuff
 		and so that was pretty bad but
 		i don't know i like that he's got it mapped out in the uh on the clipboard
 	
 	
 		
 
 		he's got a stable schedule then
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		everything kind of works out well
 	
 	
 		yeah pretty much uh
 		with the direct deposit that's what helps you know because he doesn't have the money in hand
 	
 	
 		yeah if if if you don't have to go down to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX> for something you can kind of put it in there if you have the tendency to go to the bank you kind of well i'll take <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five or ten</TIMEX> dollars here
 	
 	
 		oh well he's he's we got that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATM</ENAMEX> machine and that and his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX> is right there at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">his work</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and that's hard you know uh i'm sure you're  familiar with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> up here
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and you know how they got the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Texans</ENAMEX> uh that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Texans</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Credit Union</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">uh-huh Tex Tower</ENAMEX> yeah
 	
 	
 		right there he uh
 		he's good at uh getting into that but he's good he's you know we never in my i i've been married to him for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven years</TIMEX> and we've never had a check bounce
 	
 	
 		that's good
 	
 	
 		and uh well no i take that back <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time we did uh
 		it didn't bounce but it came close we called our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">landlord</ENAMEX> and asked her to hold off on check cashing the check for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three days</TIMEX>  we was overdrawn <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">six dollars</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		that's not too bad
 		that that's cutting it pretty close though
 	
 	
 		so
 		yeah
 		but uh it was i don't know we've never he we've had problems meeting our bills before but uh we've met them
 	
 	
 		well i think everybody has problems meeting bills now
 		not too much you can do about it
 		between the taxes and everything else everything goes up faster than the salary does
 	
 	
 		yeah that's what's going to hurt us in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX> uh we owe on our taxes and that will hurt
 	
 	
 		oh yeah so do we
 	
 	
 		and yeah that's taking money that we didn't have you know that we had set aside for uh a bill or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> and we're trying to finagle now getting ready for it because we got to pay them by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah they want their money real quick
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that's the only bad part we got the same problem
 		however i guess it uh beats the alternative
 		just not having anything to start out with
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well i know how it is to start out with nothing uh you know
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh i'm we're up to where
 		close to where we want to be but we're not quite there yet
 	
 	
 		well you get if you just keep trying pretty soon you make it
 	
 	
 		yeah i just can i just think that i it would help a lot if i got a job
 		but then
 		i'd rather be with my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		well you know <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> are important you got stay you have to stay home with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah well you know i've got a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two year old</TIMEX> and a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four year old</TIMEX> and uh
 	
 	
 		well soon as they get in to school it won't it won't be so bad
 	
 	
 		yeah but i know it would help with the bills
 	
 	
 		well Bonny
 		it it sounds like a pretty good idea
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		tell you what uh i think we about done our about <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five minutes</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		okay well it was nice talking to you
 	
 	
 		okay we'll check you later
 	
 	
 		all right bye-bye
 	
 	
 		bye-bye
