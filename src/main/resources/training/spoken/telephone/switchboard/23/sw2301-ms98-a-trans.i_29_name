 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so do you have any credit cards
 	
 	
 		yes i do i keep uh i have an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Express</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Visa</ENAMEX> card that i keep you know kind of for emergency purposes and i have you know i use a gasoline credit card which i you know pay off <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every every month</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but i've i've gotten rid of all of the credit cards you know that i possibly could and my balances are practically <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> on the ones that i have
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		especially since you know it's no longer after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> or after tax year nineteen ninety there's there's no deductions for you know credit card interest that you pay so it's a
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know gosh credit cards run what <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">anywhere from up to eighteen</NUMEX> nineteen percent i guess
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's just a bad deal course there are emergencies you know that you you know probably need to have a card
 	
 	
 		yeah i have one card
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh</ENAMEX> that's that's probably enough
 	
 	
 		and i try not to use it but right now it's maxed out
 	
 	
 		absolutely
 		yeah it's it's very easy to you know to do that or you know to abuse it it really is it's so easy to pull out the plastic
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but we're trying our best not to not to add any you know credit card debt to our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> here
 	
 	
 		yeah um
 		i have uh the thing that that bothers me worse than the credit cards i think is uh you mentioned the gasoline credit card
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i don't have that but i've got you know one of the  the
 		uh instant teller cards
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		that you can use for point of sale purchases and we use that usually to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gasoline</ENAMEX> and it's just it's really amazing how quickly that goes
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		uh-huh i'm sure you're right i don't i don't i don't participate in that but you know a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX> do
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah at least with the uh gasoline <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> credit cards you have you know up to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty twenty five thirty days</TIMEX> you know interest free for it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but you know the instant thing may be may may be the way of the future to you know to replace checks and every other thing
 	
 	
 		yeah that's what they've they've talked about it of course it eliminates any waiting period and God help those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who have to float checks occasionally because you won't be able to with that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		it certainly does
 		absolutely
 		that's right do you get any sort of discount when you use a card like that
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		i see
 	
 	
 		oh it was well they consider it to be the same as cash
 	
 	
 		i see i see i
 	
 	
 		well because it actually is yeah it's better than cash
 	
 	
 		it certainly is yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		they don't even have to deposit it it just goes straight in there
 	
 	
 		that's right no returned checks or anything
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		no i i understand it's becoming you know the popular thing to do we're not participating in that particular program at the moment and i don't really perceive doing it unless we absolutely have to
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but uh i have in times past gotten into a bit of trouble with credit cards it's just you know too easy to do
 	
 	
 		yeah but i'm so glad he told me that when that they they got to such a point with their credit cards they didn't want to cut them up because they were afraid sometime they might actually need them
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		they paid them off and then they stuck them in a thing of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> and froze them
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		she said at least before she could use them she'd have to thaw them out i mean that's funny
 	
 	
 		well that's a novel idea yeah that would cause you think a little while wouldn't it
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		that may not be a bad idea
 		
 
 		but i'm kind of
 		getting a little more leery of credit cards you know as time goes by unless you just absolutely have to now there are times when you'd at least think you do anyway
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i i want to still have just one just in case but i'd sure want to get the get it paid down and not use it for a while
 	
 	
 		so we
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		that's right my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> and i really i guess are fortunate we're really not compulsive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shoppers</ENAMEX> you know we we plan purchases you know pretty well you know watch for the best buys things like that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but uh some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have a real problem with it
 	
 	
 		yeah well our our limit is you know fairly low
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh so that's that's one thing that's good
