 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		have you had any uh major uh car repairs done recently
 	
 	
 		well as a matter of fact i just got rid of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>  because of the requirement to do some major repairs
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um i had a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Escort</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about ninety five thousand miles</NUMEX> on it and the engine was shot um
 		i i think the problem was uh the head gasket needed to be replaced
 		and um
 		but nobody would do just the head gasket everybody wanted to overhaul the engine entirely
 	
 	
 		so you're saying that the repairs would have cost more than the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> was worth
 	
 	
 		right and um
 		um
 		i did get the water pump was shot at the same time so i got the water pump fixed just to carry me over until i could sell the car um
 		which i which surprisingly the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> was in great demand um in fact i had a bunch of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> come to look at it and they were fighting over how much they were going to pay me for this piece of junk i was amazed
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i think any <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> that runs right now is in demand
 	
 	
 		i guess so um but i ended up buying a um a used <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> to replace it i got a uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eighty five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dodge Aries</ENAMEX> which only had thirty <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">four thousand miles</NUMEX> on it
 		and uh speaking of repair problems um this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> has a has an interesting problem that nobody seems to be able to fix do do you fix <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh i work on my own i've got an nineteen eighty <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trans Am</ENAMEX> that i've had uh since it was new
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		and i've had very good luck with it uh haven't had many repairs done at all the alternator went out <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four years ago</TIMEX> and uh the i had to replace the water pump back in nineteen eighty three
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but uh other than a few transmission leaks that i got repaired uh i really haven't had anything but uh regular maintenance
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		but do you do anything yourself i mean
 	
 	
 		yeah i change the oil and i do the lubrication
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		okay
 	
 	
 		but if any major problems say like uh transmission leaks i took it in for that
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and i had to have an alignment done <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> so i had that done
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		i don't think that's the kind of thing you can do yourself is it  unless you had the equipment
 	
 	
 		uh not really it's not too easy
 		i had past uh state inspection uh just <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last month</TIMEX> so
 		and i had a turn signal out so i had to take it in to get the turn signal fixed but uh other than that for passing inspection uh they gave me a shopping list of things i needed to get done
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		namely uh replacing putting the catalytic converter back on the car
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and fixing the emergency brake
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so those things i could do myself it wasn't a problem
 	
 	
 		yeah what now what <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> are you in
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texas</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> you're in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> so am i
 		um yeah the the problem i have with this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dodge</ENAMEX> uh this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dodge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Aries</ENAMEX> is that if i drive the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> for reasonable period of time enough to get the car heated up
 		and then i run to run out to do a quick errand and jump back into the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> it won't start
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and it won't start until the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> is cooled off
 		i've learned that
 		and as soon as it cools cools off it'll start right up
 	
 	
 		i had that problem with a nineteen <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixty eight</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Camaro</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		what was the problem
 	
 	
 		i never did get it fixed
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		it it could be the starter that it just gets too hot
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah somebody said that um
 		that uh there must there's probably some kind of short in the starter
 		and that when the car heats up it uh the metal expands to create the short
 		and then it it it isn't until the car cools down that the metal you know these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> pieces aren't touching any more and and uh and your you you know then it'll start because you don't have the short
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but i've taken it to a mechanic and and he started to look at it in fact i drove it out there and i said i bet you anything if you go try start the car right now you won't be able to start it sure enough he couldn't and they had to push it into the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garage</ENAMEX>
 		but they started uh tracing the wires back to see if they could find any shorts or anything and after they fiddled with the wires the problem didn't uh didn't recur recur
 		they couldn't get it to fail
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		and sure enough after i'd taken it home for you know <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of weeks</TIMEX> after that i didn't have the problem
 		but now it's starting to recur again
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so it's just one of those weird things i mean he was willing he said well i think it's in the ignition switch it'll only cost you eighty <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">five dollars</NUMEX> but i won't guarantee that's the problem
 	
 	
 		right they never do
 	
 	
 		uh yeah and i'm going well well i don't want to gamble so i just let the car cool off until i get a hard failure
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		i've heard of that problem with many other different <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> doesn't seem to be prevalent with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">just one</NUMEX> manufacturer
 	
 	
 		and then uh
 		yeah
 		well that's that's that's reassuring i've never had a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dodge</ENAMEX> before
 		and i mean it seems like a nice little car it's a great deal it only had thirty <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">four thousand miles</NUMEX> on it
 		and otherwise it doesn't give me any problems at all
 	
 	
 		i won't buy a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dodge</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you won't  oh yeah
 	
 	
 		my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> had one he had a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dodge</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six hundred and</NUMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">thousand miles</NUMEX> the head <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gasket</ENAMEX> went out
 	
 	
 		oh really Holy mackerel
 	
 	
 		nothing but problems with it so he finally traded it in and actually bought a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Escort</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh jeez
 		i've you know i've actually had a lot of luck with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fords</ENAMEX> um um i'm not gonna i'm not gonna sit here and claim that they're the best <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> in the world but
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> do like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fords</ENAMEX> yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah i mean this this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Escort</ENAMEX> even when the head <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gasket</ENAMEX> went i mean it would start <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time every time
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		uh so i've i've just been real pleased and my step father happens to work at a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">dealership</ENAMEX> and that makes things a little easier come car time but
 	
 	
 		yep
 		i'm ready for a new car myself but i've had this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eleven</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> and it's given me such little trouble that i i i don't think i could get an adequate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">replacement</ENAMEX> that would uh cause me to let huh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		i just uh i was just talking to somebody who'd had a some kind of i think he had a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cutlass</ENAMEX>
 		and he had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred and ninety</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">five thousand miles</NUMEX> on it and finally the thing finally went
 		so he goes out and he buys a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lexus</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i'm going whoa  he he moved up
 	
 	
 		i guess that's what about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">forty thousand dollars</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah i mean you know he's single he's approaching fifty years old
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		he doesn't really have anything else to spend his money on
 	
 	
 		i guess not
 	
 	
 		so but uh i can't i just can't imagine i mean are those <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> worth <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">forty thousand dollars</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		i have no idea i know they're they're engineered very well but i would have a hard time justifying spending that kind of money on any car
 	
 	
 		really
 		well it's funny because talk about car repairs i was getting my oil changed and i was sitting in the little lobby it's one of these you know <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five minute</TIMEX> change places
 		and this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> comes storming into the lobby there and he says um
 		you know you <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> advertise a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty</TIMEX> dollar oil change and you charged me <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> dollars
 		and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> says well yeah but you got a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mercedes Benz</ENAMEX> and it takes a special oil filter
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> was oh yeah he's almost proud that he had to pay an extra <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> bucks to get his oil changed i'm going
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i don't think that's worth it  i don't think spending an extra you know twenty <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">thousand dollars</NUMEX> for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> is worth it you know i don't know
 	
 	
 		
 
 		no <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX> will get get you on the oil changes anyway i took my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many years ago</TIMEX> for an oil change at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealer</ENAMEX> and they charged me <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> dollars for it
 	
 	
 		yeah oh yeah
 		oh jeez
 	
 	
 		they they gave me this cock and bull story that because there was a turbo charger on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> they had to prime the turbine with the oil
 	
 	
 		what
 	
 	
 		and it's it's it's a bunch of hog wash i i've changed the oil myself i've put a filter on you know put the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> in and all it's no problem at all
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah yeah
 		i couldn't i tried to do that with my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Escort</ENAMEX> but there's no way to change to get that oil filter out without that i could figure out without getting underneath the car
 	
 	
 		no i have to get under my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> to get the oil filter out but yeah you change it <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> times <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> it's not that big a deal filter you can buy that on sale for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> dollars uh the oil um <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">less than a dollar dollar less than a dollar</NUMEX> a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">dollar</NUMEX> a quart it's really not that
 	
 	
 		ooh
 		yeah yeah
 		oh yeah i'd prefer to do it but the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Escort</ENAMEX> was very difficult for me to get under and i didn't want to put it up on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ramps</ENAMEX> or anything it just made me nervous
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		right
 	
 	
 		i mean can you crawl underneath there or is it
 	
 	
 		well i can get the filter off just by laying down underneath the car i can't crawl under it the clearance isn't enough but enough to reach under and get the filter off it's not a problem
 	
 	
 		hum
 		yeah i just couldn't yeah
 		yeah
 		i think this uh the the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dodge</ENAMEX> would be pretty easy to change the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> on i think
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		at least i'm going to give it a try cause you can see i mean the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> filters i mean you can touch it it's right there
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh</ENAMEX> for anything else i'll put the car up on jack stands
 	
 	
 		you've got jacks it makes me nervous
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		when putting the catalytic converter back on i had to put the right side of the car up on jack stands
 	
 	
 		whoa whoa
 	
 	
 		but it wasn't a real problem
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah hm
 		well i i you know it's just a that's the biggest hassle
 		i think that if i had been nicer to my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Escort</ENAMEX> and been more diligent about getting the oil changes and doing that kind of stuff i could have probably gotten <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">another ten thousand</NUMEX> miles out of it
 	
 	
 		yeah <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">every three thousand miles</NUMEX> i'll change the oil i've got <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about ninety four</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">thousand miles</NUMEX> on the car right now
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		wow wow
 	
 	
 		and uh its working just fine i don't have any problems at all so i'm going to keep it uh i get offers  <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every now and then</TIMEX> from
 	
 	
 		gee
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		from grocery <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX> baggers that want to buy my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> because it's a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trans Am</ENAMEX> they're high school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">seniors</ENAMEX> seventeen <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years old</TIMEX> and they got to impress their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> friend
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		all right
 	
 	
 		the trouble is they think they can buy it for a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">thousand dollars</NUMEX> or less
 	
 	
 		right right
 		well i bet you i bet i mean if it's in good condition and stuff you could probably get a pretty good blue book price
 	
 	
 		yeah it's in great shape uh body is in excellent shape it just needs paint i need to look up some place to uh to get the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> painted
 	
 	
 		well
 		the paint paint job yeah if you're going to look a new car what would you look at
 	
 	
 		a new car
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		oh i'm not i don't think i'm in the new car market
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		a new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> that really hard pick
 	
 	
 		well what what what brand i mean what <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> would you look
