 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well how about you do you use PCs
 	
 	
 		oh constantly
 	
 	
 		you and i both
 	
 	
 		
 
 		it seems like uh everything i do has is computer related
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and if it goes down then we're stuck all day
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and so i like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> PC personally
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but that's pretty much everything i've worked with and uh i've become so accustomed to it that uh it's like second nature
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		what do you use
 	
 	
 		well i have an i <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM PS</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two model thirty</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		yes uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh it's kind of kind of getting too slow for me but my job i'm an EDP <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditor</ENAMEX> so i audit uh computer applications both on the PC and the mainframe level
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i use my PC constantly not only do i do PC type things like uh using lotus or word processors
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">huh-uh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i also use my PC to emulate a mainframe terminal for our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> mainframe and also to emulate a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">deck terminal</ENAMEX> for our deck machine
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		so all i have on my desk is my PC but i'm i'm getting not only our local area <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> but i'm getting <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> separate mainframe machines also
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 		oh we um we use it's an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM PS</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> also
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">huh-uh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and um
 		you know every <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">now</TIMEX> and then the file gets so big that you know it moves slower than i'd like
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">huh-uh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh but uh uh i we i do mainly um
 		graphics on it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">huh-uh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		a little bit of word processing and then lotus applications to it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		uh you know i don't know i just
 		i enjoy working with them
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		there's just there's so many capabilities out there i mean the things you can do are endless
 	
 	
 		yeah i've become kind of the PC <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guru</ENAMEX> in our audit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> because it's mostly financial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> with an accounting back ground
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and there's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of us EDP <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">auditors</ENAMEX> and one of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of us has an accounting background and so she's not real proficient in PCs and the other
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		just hasn't used PCs that much so i ended up taking on the load of making sure everybody knows what they're doing and i'm the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">administrator</ENAMEX> for our local area <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> and i need to keep that going and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so
 		i i'm i couldn't live my life without a PC i don't have one at home
 		which which
 	
 	
 		we have one at home but i just don't find the time that i can use it
 	
 	
 		yeah i would right now i would rather not have one at home because i would work at home
 	
 	
 		i
 		
 
 		yes uh
 	
 	
 		um we've got a couple of portable lap top PCs at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> that i end up bringing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of them home a lot
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		to do work if i had a machine already installed at home i would probably work <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">just about every night</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh the one of the reasons why i got mine was before i went on maternity leave they didn't know how they were going to do without me at work because i
 		am pretty much the like you said the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guru</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> with the different programs and any trouble shooting that there is
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and um
 		so they didn't know how it was going to work they're thinking that we were going to have to get a modem so that we could you know uh and a decks machine so that we could in my home so that we could make it through this <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eight weeks</TIMEX> or so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh you know it's uh
 		they're they're really great uh it's almost like we could we could become too dependent on them
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and oh
 		i the uh we use a lot of free lance and uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		that's uh
 		pretty much takes up a lot of our <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX> as far as producing transparencies and things
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and um
 		it uh you know compared to the way the things have upgraded have uh
 		really what's the word i'm looking for
 		i'm just totally drawing a blank  but uh the way things have changed over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</TIMEX> with the PC and the different programs is just great it's remarkable the things we can do now and compared to you know
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		back <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few years</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah just the power i'm i'm trying to uh get an upgraded machine mine is uh just putting along and it's not fast enough for me
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so i want to get a new uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four eighty six</NUMEX> chip but uh i don't know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i don't know if my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boss</ENAMEX> will spring for it
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but i'm i'm i'm
 		i determined to brake <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mine</ENAMEX> so he has to get me another one
 	
 	
 		we think about that a lot
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		well that's what i do we had a printer a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">a Hewlett Packard Ready Writer</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and we had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about ten</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> sharing this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">printer</ENAMEX> by it was attached to like a central PC and you had to take your diskette to the PC to print something
 	
 	
 		oh
 		um now that's awful
 	
 	
 		so the first thing when i started working at this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX> is i said well now <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of all we need to all be able to share this PC without getting up
 		so i talked my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boss</ENAMEX> into investing in a it's not a uh
 		a uh real elaborate local area <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> but we can share the printer
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">huh-uh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and we can uh send files to each other and we can mail send mail messages to each other which is what which is good enough it's what we need
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh okay
 		um-hum right
 	
 	
 		and then i talked them into buying a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HP Laser Jet</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh yes
 	
 	
 		and that was a major ordeal to get him to buy it but once he bought it he has been so pleased
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it's it's fast it's quite oh it has good copy
 	
 	
 		right the quality that you can out off with one of those as compared to one of those dot matrix printers
 	
 	
 		yeah i've got a little little uh <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">IBM Pro Printer</ENAMEX> on my desk but and i can use either the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Pro Printer</ENAMEX> or i've got my PC configured to where i can use either printer the one that's on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> or my own
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so if i just need something real quick and i don't feel like getting up and going and getting what i printed i can just print it in my office
 	
 	
 		um uh we're just trying to talk ours into getting a laser printer
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh it's just so you you know with budget restraints and things like that it's makes it difficult
 	
 	
 		they have gotten really cheap <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hewlett Packard</ENAMEX> makes it's it's actually a dot matrix printer
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but the quality is almost uh laser quality
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i think it's called the desk jet
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and they're under i think they're uh <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about eight hundred dollars</NUMEX> now
 	
 	
 		and we uh got a quote on some laser printers <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the other day</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">six hundred</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		uh yeah i don't remember what kind they were uh but uh we uh do a lot of transparencies
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">huh-uh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		sometimes the color would take too long to plot uh plot out
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so they just want black and white ones and see we can just run them through the laser printer real quick
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		because it will only take a minute to print one of those out and then run a thermal copy of it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh it uh
 	
 	
 		i mean that's all you need for like for like bullet charts and stuff you don't need them in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> colors
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		no uh-huh if it was a customer presentation then that would be different we would want to razzle-dazzle a bit but uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's uh yeah we have one in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> and if we want to use it well in our area if we want to use it we have to you know like you said you had to change it put it on a disc
 		and carry it over to there and see if they're not using the printer
 	
 	
 		you use the sneaker net system
 	
 	
 		right  and uh wait for an opportunity to use it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah we you'd have to just sit and wait while someone else was using the printer
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		until they got off the machine
 	
 	
 		i know i know i understand
 	
 	
 		that was uh i was amazed when i came to work i worked at the uh
 		well it used to be the largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Antonio</ENAMEX> until <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C N B</ENAMEX> came up and bought the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">rival</ENAMEX> and now <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N C N B</ENAMEX> and now <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N C N B</ENAMEX>'s got a little larger market share
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but it's the only uh
 		well it's part of the bank holding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> and that bank holding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> largest banking holding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> it's the only one that's still alive
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so any way i work in a big prestigious place
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and i couldn't believe when i walked in the door on my <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">first day</TIMEX> and here's the audit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> of this this huge holding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> sharing a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HP Rugged Writer</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i was going oh wait a minute
 		come on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> this is crummy
 	
 	
 		right
 		so how are you supposed to expect to stay number one when you're behind the  times in technology here
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah we're we're pushing real hard though we're we're trying well see the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX> is not like that we the the bank philosophy is one of innovation innovation and lead the market
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it's just the audit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> happened to be just a little behind the times because the uh the senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice president</ENAMEX> over audits is cheap
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and it's real hard to pry money out of him to to to do these things but i was i was able to convince him that it would be cost effective and that our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> presentations would be much better and
 	
 	
 		right we we find it hard to believe sometimes or hard to understand when uh
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		we work for a computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> and uh
 		how are we supposed to present the imagine that we're supposed to present with equipment that's outdated and when it's obsolete
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> that that some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> that run this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">place</ENAMEX> are very tight and it's like well why do we need this can't you do that with you know what we have and when we try and then they complain about this doesn't look good
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		unfortunately the the uh computer equipment and and related peripherals are changing and improving so rapidly like for instance we bought a
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
