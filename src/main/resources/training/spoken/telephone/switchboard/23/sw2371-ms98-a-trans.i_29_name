 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay we're supposed to
 		talk about what the weather's been like let's see uh
 	
 	
 		it's been
 		pretty windy
 	
 	
 		yeah it's been windy <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past few weeks</TIMEX> i've noticed that
 	
 	
 		yeah so far
 	
 	
 		has been hasn't been too much <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rain</ENAMEX> which is really nice
 		because <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX> all that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rain</ENAMEX> and it was just
 		bad with all the flooding when uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trinity Mills Road</ENAMEX> flooded over all those times you couldn't i couldn't pass by it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh yeah
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		well i i didn't have to go down there but uh
 		uh driving on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">freeway</ENAMEX> was uh made it difficult because everybody couldn't get off and they'd get off somewhere else
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		right well you know they said that we haven't had enough rain though and that surprises me because it seems like we've had a lot of rain this year
 		but since we've uh last i heard that we hadn't met our you know hadn't got up to the right level yet that we
 	
 	
 		yeah the current average or whatever
 	
 	
 		right well it truly surprises me because it seems like we
 		seems like we do get a lot of rain but i guess not i guess it doesn't accumulate too much
 		but um i'm glad it's summer
 	
 	
 		yeah  finally
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i like the warm weather
 	
 	
 		me too
 	
 	
 		and the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> wasn't that bad i was really grateful that it didn't get that bad <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this winter</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i'm not uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fan</ENAMEX> of cold weather i've lived up in in the northern part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> and i never did like the cold weather that much
 	
 	
 		i don't either i want some you know ski or something you know i'm benefiting from it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i guess  in a way i just i really like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX> like to uh be able to lay out or you know just be outside
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah i don't mind the heat that much it doesn't bother me that much cold weather i just i don't know i just can't tolerate too much with the
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i know it seems like you can never get warm enough to
 	
 	
 		yeah so i like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> it's a nice place to be
 	
 	
 		i do too
 	
 	
 		and so i guess it's probably the same over where you're at in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Garland</ENAMEX> as opposed to Lewisville
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		i would think i don't know might be a little bit different because the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> interferes with the weather patterns to a certain extent because of the heating of the of the concrete and asphalt
 	
 	
 		true
 		that's true that's true it does seem to uh
 	
 	
 		that's why they say always say it's like <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> degrees warmer in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> time than out in the country
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		uh-huh i do like um
 		like an old uh warm <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> the breezes that it gets at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> you know you can open your windows and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		oh and it gets those nice warm breezes coming in that's nice
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and that helps on utilities
 	
 	
 		of course
 		who can't use that
 	
 	
 		yeah and that's especially in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Garland</ENAMEX>  it's real bad
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		especially in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> period
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah well we didn't have much we had some good <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> but not a lot thank goodness not
 	
 	
 		well have you lived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> all your life
 	
 	
 		yeah sure have how about you
 	
 	
 		no uh this is this is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX> state i've lived in
 	
 	
 		are you serious
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		so i've just been all over the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> and uh some places had really cold weather when i was living in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indiana</ENAMEX> it got really cold
 	
 	
 		ugh
 	
 	
 		i mean <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX> it was like <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">sixty below zero</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		are you serious
 	
 	
 		and uh uh they said you know stay inside
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		in fact <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> i was driving <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one night</TIMEX> and i was listening to some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">station</ENAMEX> some radio station in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iowa</ENAMEX> and uh the uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DJ</ENAMEX> was saying uh <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">tonight</TIMEX>'s going to be like eighty below
 	
 	
 		gosh
 	
 	
 		and he said uh this is serious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX> this is serious business stay inside do not go outside at any for any reason
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> that's horrible
 	
 	
 		and i thought yeah no kidding
 	
 	
 		ooh i hate that that's horrible
 	
 	
 		that of course that was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> when we had the real bad freeze you know in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> and this <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last winter</TIMEX> wasn't wasn't that bad as as i remember it
 	
 	
 		right know
 		well that's true well a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> of mine went home <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this weekend</TIMEX> uh he lives up in the uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan Handle</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and um he went home for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Easter</ENAMEX> and it snowed up there and then <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next day</TIMEX> it was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">up to seventy five</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		is that right
 	
 	
 		yeah that would be horrible
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i wouldn't like that
 		well you just can't depend on it
 	
 	
 		schizophrenic weather
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah it's just real comfortable here where we live and that's the way i like it i like being able to depend on a hot <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> and
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know it does it gets cold enough in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the winter</TIMEX> to where you
 	
 	
 		you realize it
 	
 	
 		yeah and you can do your fires and everything and then move on
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		when i lived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> they had uh
 		what i describe as boring weather it was the same virtually year-round which what i thought was great you didn't have to worry about tornadoes you didn't have to worry about uh too cold or too hot it was just nice and even and i liked that it was it was nice
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh i don't mind the heat
 	
 	
 		i don't either
 	
 	
 		i don't i don't miss the cold at all but i don't mind the heat
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i wouldn't mind some you know like i guess after awhile in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX> when it hits i guess about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX> and you get a few cool days
 		i don't mind that because it kind of gives you some relief
 	
 	
 		yeah that's right it's kind of nice too to have that fall
 	
 	
 		you know that's nice
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		spring and fall are nice times of the year
 	
 	
 		yeah they really are
 	
 	
 		spring because we're getting that getting rid of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> finally
 	
 	
 		yeah and all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> are coming out thank goodness and grass
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		for a change i i got i get <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sick</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> just looking everything so dead i hate that
 	
 	
 		yeah no kidding
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		that's uh kind of depressing to see all that
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah it really is it's just an old gray looking sky and it's boring
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		really i guess it wouldn't be bad if you i guess up north it wouldn't be bad to visit we we love to go skiing and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">um snow</ENAMEX> it's beautiful when it snows and you have all those pine <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> and everything that is pr etty but i sure couldn't live there
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah it's something you have to get used to i guess i mean i lived with that for a while and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you just adapt
 	
 	
 		i guess so
 	
 	
 		to a certain extent here in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX> time we go back and forth between air-conditioned <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> there you go back and forth between warmed up areas i mean uh
 	
 	
 		warm
 		i guess so
 	
 	
 		i remember when i was living in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indiana</ENAMEX> i was uh uh going going to school there and i used to ride my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bike</ENAMEX> across <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">campus</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX> it was it must've been close to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> degrees above <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> and
 	
 	
 		um
 		God
 	
 	
 		and i thought well if i ride my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bike</ENAMEX> the wind chill will be close to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> it will last <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">seven minutes six minutes</TIMEX> if i walk it'll be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> degrees warmer but it will last <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty minutes</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		um
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		which do i want you know it's colder for a shorter time or a little bit warmer for a for a longer time and so i took the shorter colder option
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		hum
 		right
 		right
 		i don't blame you  i would too
 	
 	
 		and i got down to where i uh to to the building i was going to and my face was about frozen off and i thought was that such a good choice i weren't quite so sure at that point
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i do hate that feeling though it
 	
 	
 		oh yeah frostbites
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah my fingers always get get it real bad i hate that i mean i bundle them up and everything and and i still get it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i guess i can bare the cold it's just when it does the wind hits
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		oh that just feels like it goes all the way to the bone
 	
 	
 		it does
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you can feel all the way through it's like a knife like a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">sword</ENAMEX> like a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">sword</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">sword slicing</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> or whatever
 	
 	
 		yeah it hurts
 		exactly hurts i hate it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh well i don't know what else i can say about it
 	
 	
 		well me either
 		it's kind of a boring topic
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i guess
 	
 	
 		well i guess that's all i to say you too
 	
 	
 		all right then i'm through you too bye-bye
 	
 	
 		have a good <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</TIMEX> bye
