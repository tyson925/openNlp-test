 
     		
 	
 		
 
 		so what kind of camping do you like
 	
 	
 		well we uh as a little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> i used to go camping with my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> and uh we'd load up our <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> and take tents and cots and all kinds of stuff and
 		the place that we went the most often was uh in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oklahoma</ENAMEX> it's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about a two</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">three hour</NUMEX> drive and it is a little bitty national <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> right in the right in a town called <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Sulphur Oklahoma</ENAMEX>
 		and it was real pretty had lots of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> and creeks to play in and it was a lot of fun
 	
 	
 		so you like that more civilized kind of camping you got cots
 	
 	
 		yeah probably so
 	
 	
 		yeah well i'm i'm sort of a rough-and-ready camper i'll uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		whatever i can carry on a backpack
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		is is what i go with
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um when i was in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX> i used to be up in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Dakota</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and there were some really nice places up in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Black Hills</ENAMEX> to go camping
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i had this really nice place you had to uh drive in as far as i could and then <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> and then you had to walk in the rest of the way
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but it was across a little stream and it was sort of um
 		uh not a big area but there was a perfectly round stand of trees
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and it had a nice little area inside that course it gave you shelter and everything
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and it was right next to a nice cold stream
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		so it was my favorite place
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and probably the worse thing that ever happened was around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX> the weather starts getting funny it will be warm <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX> and freezing the next
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so but that's also about the time you start getting cabin fever
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		well i had cabin fever really bad so i loaded up the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> and took off
 		and i got up there and got camped or got got my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camp</ENAMEX> setup
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and that night it got down to seventeen below and started snowing
 	
 	
 		oh my goodness
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		did you have uh very warm sleeping bag or
 	
 	
 		oh i had i had a nice sleeping bag i also had uh uh catalytic heater
 	
 	
 		oh my goodness
 	
 	
 		um but i woke up and the snow was halfway up the the front of the tent
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i'm going oh no
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i go out i had all my stuff set i had my little campfire thing setup and my
 		my pots and pans and stove and all that
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and i get everything's buried under snow so i'm out there digging around so i think well to hell with it you know i'll go i'll go play around for a while
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well there's this fallen tree across the stream and these streams of course are felt fed by melted snow so they're cold anyway
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah oh yeah
 	
 	
 		so here i am going across this snow encrusted log
 	
 	
 		oh no
 	
 	
 		and i slipped and fell in
 	
 	
 		oh no
 	
 	
 		and crashed through the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> right up to my neck in freezing cold weather i could just feel my heart going
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh
 		oh no
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		how did you get out of that
 	
 	
 		well fortunately i had the presence of mind when i slipped i just i just went with it i didn't try to twist or anything
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and as i went i just turned and stuck my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX> out and i hit the hit the log with my arms
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and that pretty much saved me from going all the way under
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um anyway i finally pulled myself out and i mean just as soon as i got out my clothes started freezing
 	
 	
 		oh man
 		oh that's awful
 	
 	
 		yeah so i i
 		trotted back to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> rather quickly
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">uh</ENAMEX> jumped in went home and took a hot shower and changed clothes and went back
 	
 	
 		oh my goodness  oh that's quite an experience i probably would have had a <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart attack</ENAMEX> and died right there on the spot
 	
 	
 		it was
 		i think i almost did that was something
 	
 	
 		oh that
 		i bet
 	
 	
 		yeah i i enjoy camping i like getting out
 		especially i don't i don't understand these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people people</ENAMEX> take these camper <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trailers</ENAMEX> and stuff i mean that's that's not camping i mean that's like
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		yeah that's just like moving to another area for a while
 	
 	
 		yeah i mean here you are you got you know you got showers and stoves and refrigerators and TV's and air conditioning
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i mean good grief that's not camping
 	
 	
 		i know it's kind of funny
 	
 	
 		i like to rough it
 	
 	
 		yeah well did you go camping by yourself then you didn't go with other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> or
 	
 	
 		no usually i went by myself it was sort of get away from everybody time
 	
 	
 		huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and you've been locked up with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX> all <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> it's time to get away by yourself
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and it was so it was so nice up there that just
 		i mean it was so
 		quiet and peaceful
 	
 	
 		yeah well that's nice
 	
 	
 		yeah it's nice nice area
 	
 	
 		yeah just a second
 		uh when i uh planned my little uh schedule of when i could talk on the phone this one was suppose to be asleep
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and she's not cooperating
 	
 	
 		yeah she fooled you
 	
 	
 		yeah i think so
 	
 	
 		uh i've got <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">kitty cats</ENAMEX> and they were suppose to be taking a nap and
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> just crawled up in my lap and every time she hears me on the phone she's got to come sit in my lap
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah wants you to
 	
 	
 		got to be got to be part of the action here
 	
 	
 		my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> want a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> so bad and uh i'd i'd like to get them one but we live close to a busy street and almost everyone has a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> it's been hit run over maimed you know and i just can't stand the thought of it
 	
 	
 		oh
 		yeah all all <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mine</ENAMEX> are uh purebreds so i keep them in
 	
 	
 		so
 		yeah keep them in the house
 	
 	
 		yeah especially
 	
 	
 		well that may be our only option if we ever get one
 	
 	
 		especially
 		especially this one
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		she's a mess
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		aren't you <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">kitty cat</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		well
 		this is real interesting that you're as far away as you are because i really thought this was uh uh we're
 	
 	
 		sort of like <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> exclusive
 	
 	
 		yeah <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> yeah and so i just figured no it's just this area you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		well that's interesting
 	
 	
 		have you had many calls
 	
 	
 		well you're my <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> one and i have never gotten the courage to do it myself isn't that funny
 	
 	
 		well i tell you it's it's easy to do it's just uh like when i started calling you it was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty</TIMEX> my time <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty</TIMEX> your time i guess
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and however long it took however long we've been on that's how long it took for some for the computer to find somebody
 	
 	
 		for it to
 		oh my
 	
 	
 		yeah i've been sitting here and sitting here and sitting here
 	
 	
 		oh i never thought about that that it would take a long time to find someone available
 	
 	
 		i didn't think it would take as long as it does but like <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">last night</TIMEX> when i made one
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		the long that was the longest one i waited <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five minutes</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh my goodness
 	
 	
 		and sometimes you'll get it on the first try i mean it's just
 	
 	
 		yeah i guess it depends on the time of day too
 	
 	
 		yeah this is not a real good time of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX> because most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> listed their home numbers and of course they're gone
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but i've got a class tonight so i wanted to get these out of the way
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		this is this is my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">thirtieth</ENAMEX> call
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that's great well i got a catalog that you know shows all the gifts and things you can get and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i started getting inspired thinking oh we need to do this i'd like to have a few of those things
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah the only reason i'd do it is because i want to make sure that i get all my calls in before they they just up and pull the plug on the program you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that's right and they probably will soon so
 	
 	
 		yeah because being a student i'm doing it for the money
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i can see that
 	
 	
 		i want to make sure i'm i'm my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">roommate</ENAMEX> does it too
 	
 	
 		huh well that's pretty neat
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		it'll be a nice little bit of money we're going to
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah every time i've talked to one of them my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> said i can't believe that you made <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">five dollars</NUMEX> every time you do that  it sounds easy  so he signed up to do it but he's never done <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> so
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well of course there's this other one that i've i've talked to fairly regularly in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> um same thing her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> signed up for it and she's the one that does it
 	
 	
 		i know
 		yeah i know it's crazy
 	
 	
 		but he'll spend the money i bet
 	
 	
 		that's right yeah he'll say yeah i did that
 	
 	
 		yeah we're going to take the money and get uh go out and find a nice stud for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Himy Persian</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		yeah she's a she's a beauty we're going to going to get a nice litter off of her
 	
 	
 		well that will be neat
 	
 	
 		yeah she's she's so sweet too
 	
 	
 		oh i tell you my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> would love to they'd just want any kind of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> bless their hearts
 		and like i said um i really would like to have one too because i know how much they want one It's just hard one my youngest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> has <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asthma</ENAMEX> and uh been a little afraid to have a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX> all the time with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> that has asthma
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so i thought well i need an <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">outdoor cat</ENAMEX> but if i have an <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">outdoor cat</ENAMEX> i'm afraid it's going to get hurt so
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i have a problem
 	
 	
 		yeah that's that's bit a problem i mean you could always buy a uh you could always buy a Sphinx
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		those are hairless <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> of course they're
 	
 	
 		huh i don't think they'd be too fun
 	
 	
 		oh they are they're they're loads of fun that's the most playful <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> around
 	
 	
 		are they
 		huh
 	
 	
 		but they on the other hand too they cost twenty <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">five hundred dollars</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh my land i'd be scared to death to have anything that expensive
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah my my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">roomy</ENAMEX> wants to buy a a Sphinx
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		and i keep saying no no no
 	
 	
 		oh i've never heard of that
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		we both decided on a Devonrex though it's sort of like a Sphinx it's a very short haired <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		it's almost like just fuzz
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		but uh they're substantially cheaper
 	
 	
 		yeah i would hope so
 	
 	
 		we're we're into this breeding business pretty heavy now and he
 	
 	
 		well that's good
 	
 	
 		yeah as long as you don't lose sight that they're still <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">kitty cats</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		and they're fun to have around
 	
 	
 		yeah i guess so
 	
 	
 		this one here is just sweet
 	
 	
 		oh that's neat
 	
 	
 		she's kneading on my my stomach pushing and pushing and drooling
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		quit drooling on me look at this i'm wet
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well it was nice talking to you i think i'm going to have to catch my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> before she eats any more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">candy</ENAMEX> when i'm on the phone that's her sign that she can do what she wants to do
