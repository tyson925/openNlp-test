 
     		
 	
 		
 
 		i don't know i grew up uh in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the sixties</TIMEX> and at that time
 		uh it was is a changing time for the whole music scene i guess and i grew up with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Beatles</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rolling Stones</ENAMEX> and the whole pot culture during that time and went through that phase and
 		kind of stayed with it i guess for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several years</TIMEX> after i graduated from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">college</ENAMEX> and and thereafter but have since
 		uh i grew up in a small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> in in southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oklahoma</ENAMEX> i have kind of gone back to uh more of a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">county</ENAMEX> uh flavor in music um
 		i'm not quite sure why that is and it seems like almost a opposite but i guess i got away from what i consider to be the pot
 		uh sounding music it didn't have what you know guess what i was looking for at the time <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> tells more of a a story it kind of reminds me of my roots of growing up and i've i've become i guess more of a country <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fan</ENAMEX> over the years
 	
 	
 		when you say that you grew up uh in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the sixties</TIMEX> i take it that was the uh teenage type <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> or uh
 	
 	
 		yeah that was my teenage <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> i was born in fifty and and uh
 	
 	
 		okay
 		we we're very similarly aged so we probably have an interesting interesting perspective on the music on the times so i'm just <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple years</TIMEX> older than you uh
 		essentially i was one of the nerdy types in high school really which meant that i for one reason or another i didn't pay much attention to music but as i look back now i realize it was very formative for me
 		uh
 		my early popular music <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">interests</ENAMEX> were in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Simon</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Garfunkel</ENAMEX> whom i saw perform when i was in college and i became attached to that style of uh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">urban</ENAMEX> urban <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> if there is such a thing i think with in
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		a way one could talk about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simon</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Garfunkel</ENAMEX> that way because they do tend uh to have a dramatic or story approach to their music uh usually tend to have some sort of good or bad moral to it
 		uh
 		over time i became very interested in in baroque classical and i think that was just through
 		experiencing contacting college and the fact that i found it it very relaxing for me my tastes now run i guess to a upbeat
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">uh Simon</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's something that interests me uh combined with with the classical tastes i had mentioned and my classical music tends to be confined to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seventeen hundreds</NUMEX> early <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eighteen hundred</NUMEX>
 		music i'm not a music um  i'm not particularly schooled in it i know what i like to listen to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">as far as</NUMEX> classical music
 	
 	
 		that's kind of the way i am
 	
 	
 		and i
 		i spent a good deal of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">time</TIMEX> listening also to uh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> from the late <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">seventies</ENAMEX> really um <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neil Diamond</ENAMEX> for instance
 		Um
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of of that particular time i
 		listen to some <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> and western but i'm not school
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">schooled</ENAMEX> in it and i i've enjoyed the times when i have listened to it i played a little bit of piano i continue to think that i want to do it and i never have the discipline to stay with it
 		but when i do play
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh and</ENAMEX> and begin to reacquire skills i inevitably fall in love with country western music which tends to be in some ways easy to play for a for a new piano player
 	
 	
 		it is it's got uh basically an easy uh rhythm and and tone
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and it's it's pretty fairly well easily to uh uh something to fall into i'm kind of the say way i i've gone through different periods of life uh in music
 		from pop to classical i guess one of the things was that influenced me was that i i've worked in radio <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stations</ENAMEX> as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DJ</ENAMEX> for all my college <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> trying to support my way through there and support was support was uh
 		influenced by all different kinds of music but basically because that's where i worked and i've developed a real love for uh classical music in
 		probably junior high and high school because my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">band instructor</ENAMEX> was uh heavy into classical type music he said he used to sit on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">mornings</TIMEX> and watch cartoons just to hear the music
 		uh that they were using behind them because they used especially <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Disney</ENAMEX> used a lot of classical music
 		uh behind the cartoons and so consequently we wind up wound up playing a lot of classical music there and i think that uh got deep seated into me one of things i especially like now in music regardless of what kind it is
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> are those that call on those classical uh
 		roots i guess uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barry Manilow</ENAMEX> comes to mind for some reason there's there's not a whole  lot of his stuff that i'm real crazy about but he does have some things <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX> had some things
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> and i think even <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Electric Light Orchestra</ENAMEX> had some
 		some real um
 		influences by classical music and
 		i'm still still my favorite in fact most of my CDs that i got are classical music
 	
 	
 		i find it very interesting that some television shows that i enjoy i particularly like the music i don't know which is chicken and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egg</ENAMEX> in that situation
 		uh a good example would be uh i have connections but but not particularly deep ones to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Vietnamese</ENAMEX> war type situations
 		uh
 		and i found that i really like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China Beach</ENAMEX> and i particularly like <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Tour of Duty</ENAMEX> and both of them i had as much fascination of the background music i think going on as i did to the theme of the shows
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> and i i've uh Thirty Something i'm particularly interested but it's the music almost that i find myself listening to
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i'm kind of thinking that's maybe our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> was
 		uh so in tuned to music
 		of that time that we identify
 		goodness or badness with uh things now with the music that's behinds them
 	
 	
 		that could well be i i uh
 		spent my junior year uh
 		and sophomore and junior year in in college when i a song by the uh
 		uh i think the title of it was just Downtown
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> and if you recall how it goes downtown <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">da</ENAMEX> dah dah dah
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh all i have to do is hear that song
 		and i get you strongly evoked memories of of difficult times in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> being behind on work
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> and
 		my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> now knows if they come into my study and uh
 		i happen to have had a tough day at work and maybe i'm trying to get a project done uh at school
 		uh
 		and i'm humming or whistling in a sort of mad crazy way the tune to Downtown they know to just stay away
 	
 	
 		that's their signal
 	
 	
 		
 
 		they can hear the unconscious music signal behind it that's right
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		when did you first take your uh first piano lesson
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh probably about <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> grade
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i have uh returned about every <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four or five years</TIMEX> to thinking that i would like to do something about it
 		i usually get to the point where i can play some of my favorite themes and then inevitably i am swept away by the
 		the pressure of other types of things uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		it is a time consumer
 	
 	
 		it is in order to continue to to grow and i
 		i always think that i'll be able to do it and then i inevitably discover that i have no innate music talent relative to composition and that i struggle and really can't quite understand what is that other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> take for granted
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		in composition themes and i keys and things are something to me that remain a mystery no matter how many times i bang on them i have a pretty good mathematical concept for what's involved
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh but in a in a innate music sense there just seems to be something missing there which is always frustrating for me since i have pretty high math <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aptitude</ENAMEX> and i keep thinking gee i thought that all the math and music <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are supposed to go hand in hand but but it doesn't for me
 	
 	
 		no it's making that that connection especially with the mechanical
 		parts of it i was never able to to master all that in fact my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> both they were oh thirteen <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixteen years</TIMEX> older than i they went through the uh
 		parent thing where you've got to practice or you're not going out to play thing
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and when it came to my turn the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX> said no we're not going through that again they sold the piano and is the turns out i was the only one who really had an interest in it and never got to so i that's one of things i felt like i missed in life and i i really in fact uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of my favorite things to do now is sit down and listen to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chopin</ENAMEX> that is played on uh piano i just
 		you know i can just drift off into some other world just listening to that for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> if i ever have the time to do that
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		maybe one of these days i'll you know i'm kind of like you maybe one of these days i'll get around to it i'll do something with the piano but probably not
 	
 	
 		so we both have a secret background that says somehow or another we just knew we were piano <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX> and never g ot a chance uh
 	
 	
 		just never got a chance to come out no
 	
 	
 		that's the most fascinating thing
 	
 	
 		well it's a pleasure talking with you
 	
 	
 		and you sir you take care
 	
 	
 		of luck in your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">graduate</ENAMEX> school
