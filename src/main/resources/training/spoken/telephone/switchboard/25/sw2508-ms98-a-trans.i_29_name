 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		how do you uh manage your budget
 	
 	
 		well let's see we or i sit down at the
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		uh in a on a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</TIMEX> or a biweekly i get paid <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every two weeks</TIMEX> so i make out a budget for every <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks</TIMEX> and
 		i sit down and see how much money i have to have for my bills going out
 		and then i compare that to uh how much money we need to make and
 		then just set it up that way and allot this much money for everything and if we have any left over we'll
 		uh you know buy clothes or have fun go out to eat or something
 		and we're going to try to start saving
 		as soon as we can
 		we generally don't have a lot left over but as far as the long term our long-term goal is to to get out of debt
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		most most of our debts are from before we were married and we're trying to get rid of you know student loans those kinds of things
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well i in my younger <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> i'd always heard the adage you should uh buy as much of a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> as you can afford
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> because of the uh improvement in real estate prices
 		and on the last move we bought ourselves a fairly large house
 		and i've got some pretty stiff mortgage payments now
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh the uh
 		improvement in uh income and uh investments and so forth has not uh come at the rate i've expected so we're still kind of hurting by the uh high mortgage payments and we haven't gotten out from under them yet
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		so far we've managed to hold our own by uh
 		trying to set up a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a monthly</TIMEX> budget
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh i try to take out just so much cash for me and my uh give so much cash to my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		to spend on groceries and clothing and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fuel</ENAMEX> for the car
 		and then the rest of it's uh pretty much fixed expenses uh mortgage electricity
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> and uh
 		and garbage collection and telephone bills and cable television bills
 		and those are pretty much fixed
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah that's basically the kinds of bills we have are on our budget are you know the needs the have to haves and
 		you know those kinds of things uh we don't have a lot of uh
 		you know like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JC Penny's</ENAMEX> in our  in our budget and uh maybe twice <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> we're to where i can let my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> go clothes shopping like that and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		let's see my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother-in-law</ENAMEX> lives uh not too far from here so she helps with our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX>'s clothes when she can
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and
 		that's real good and uh
 		well at <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> i have a real good benefits package for uh
 		uh
 		you know like for going to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> and that kind of thing so that's not something i really have to put in the budget that seriously
 		so
 	
 	
 		yeah no my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>'s pretty good about uh grocery shopping and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		she pitches in and uh makes clothes for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		really well that's neat
 	
 	
 		uh which is a big help uh one of our big problems though is handling unexpected uh uh budget items
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this month</TIMEX> the uh heat pump went out and uh
 	
 	
 		um yeah
 	
 	
 		they want pretty <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">close to three thousand dollars</NUMEX> just to replace that
 	
 	
 		wow
 		so what do you do
 	
 	
 		well uh we have to cut into the savings uh at this point to uh to buffer that
 	
 	
 		oh
 		wow
 	
 	
 		and
 	
 	
 		well that's good that you have the savings to get into
 	
 	
 		
  
 		then maybe we'll go for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a week or two and or a month or two</TIMEX> and then the car breaks down
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so it's the unexpected things that make it awful hard to control the budget
 	
 	
 		wow
 		yeah that's
 		that's the way we are we've had a lot of unexpected things just in the last uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">couple months</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that uh really hit us hard but i've been able to work enough overtime to you know really help with the with covering the expenses
 		so but we've never been we've been married for uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nearly four years</TIMEX> and we've never been able to save any money and i think it's just
 		hit both of us uh just in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past few months</TIMEX> that we need to start saving some money no matter what we do we need to put that in our budget and just start doing it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		even if it's you know <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> dollars a week
 		and so we're going to start doing that or actually we started <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two paychecks ago</TIMEX>
 		and that was uh i think that was a really wise decision
 	
 	
 		well do you have some uh savings plans at work
 	
 	
 		no actually i'm i'm not involved in anything like that at work or
 		uh anywhere uh i don't have anything to fall back on at all
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i i know that's not wise but
 		that's just uh where we're at right now my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> just went back to work part-time uh she can substitute teach at schools
 		and uh there's so many school districts and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> here in the metroplex that uh by turning her name in if she wanted to she could work
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know everyday but
 		we're we're just going to let her work one maybe <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two days a week</TIMEX> and we're just going to apply all the money that she makes to uh
 		uh our debts and try to get as much out of debt as fast we can
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and there's and we're we're <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christians</ENAMEX> and that's uh we've only been <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christians</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about five years</TIMEX> but that's a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">a real</NUMEX> a biblical truth in the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bible</ENAMEX> is to
 		to not be in debt and we're really starting to see the the the reasoning behind that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh because we're you know we're always well i can't be sick <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</TIMEX> but one day
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		or you know <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this month</TIMEX> but <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX> because you know our bills will catch up with us if i am
 		or you know i can't we can't go on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a two week</TIMEX> vacation because
 		uh i wouldn't make any overtime in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks</TIMEX> so that would really hurt us financially and you know just things like that all time and you know we we really see how we're
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know indebted or nearly underneath uh the debt that we have
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know and that's that's really hard but
 		so far we've never really uh been behind on any bills uh
 		i had to put our student loans on hold once for about i think <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three months</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and we had a a cutback at work
 		and uh this is this was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of years back</TIMEX>
 		but anyway but we're doing really good we're not saving but we're staying right even
 	
 	
 		well we've been looking around at uh
 		uh trying to develop some side activities that that might help out such as uh creating some <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">craft</ENAMEX> objects that we can market in the uh local stores
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		or uh
 		uh making uh some dresses for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> or things l ike that or even writing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>'s books
 	
 	
 		yeah that's neat
 		oh that's neat yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		i tried uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this past year</TIMEX> writing uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journal</ENAMEX> articles but uh i found out it cost me more than the the honorariums i got for writing them
 	
 	
 		wow
 		oh wow because of the time
 	
 	
 		uh well especially the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> one because i wound up buying a lot of reprints for handouts and i ate up all my profits with uh
 	
 	
 		wow
 		right
 	
 	
 		buying reprints
 	
 	
 		right
 		wow
 		yeah my my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> made uh a whole lot of crafts <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> presents
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and we didn't uh
 		you know have to allot any well hardly very very much money anyway for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> just for our uh personal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> just me and her and our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> and
 		i think her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mom</ENAMEX> and that was really you know about it we we made everything else that uh we gave for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas last year</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and she did really good with that
 	
 	
 		oh we thought we were going to be pretty tight with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas this past year</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but uh we have a family <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> that uh ate all of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>'s toys
 		so coming up to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> time  the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> didn't have any toys so we had to go out and
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 		wow
 		oh no
 	
 	
 		and get them a whole new set of playthings
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		
  
 		now i don't know how the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> has fared eating all that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plastic</ENAMEX> and uh and stuffed animal stuffing but  he's still here
 	
 	
 		
 
 		wow wow that's pretty pretty bizarre  the dog ate <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Christmas</TIMEX> presents
 		that's funny well anyway what uh is the economy doing pretty good there where you're at
 	
 	
 		so far it's uh doing fairly well uh we're in the metropolitan <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> area
 		and uh i guess most of the area is still living off the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> with uh
 		beltway bandit type contracts
 		uh our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> is uh done fairly well
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah what <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> is it
 	
 	
 		i'm with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Melpar</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX> of E-Systems
 	
 	
 		oh of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">E-Systems</ENAMEX> okay
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i see what do you all make
 	
 	
 		uh we're primarily in the uh uh systems integrations business
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		selling to the government
