 
     		
 	
 		
 
 		we go
 	
 	
 		so how do you rate gun control
 	
 	
 		well i think uh i think on a scale of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> i would be i would be more toward a uh a uh uh an
 		a stand that would not totally ban <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX> but would certainly very much control them uh
 	
 	
 		i agree
 	
 	
 		yeah i think that uh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh and</ENAMEX> and you know i i say this because i'm coming from a i'm coming from my my uh uh my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Massachusetts</ENAMEX> are all avid <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">gun</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX>'s got a big collection
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX>'s got a collection there they both uh do police work uh they go out and shoot and
 		they're from the mentality that when uh uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX> were against the law only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">criminals</ENAMEX> owned them that sort of thing
 	
 	
 		i agree
 	
 	
 		but i uh uh i i think it's far too easy for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to get guns
 		uh let me let me tell you a little a little more of of my background where i've really come to this position i i as i've told you before uh we lived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malaysia</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four years</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and it uh i tell you how against the law <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX> or any kind of firearms are uh it's a hanging offense
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh my gosh
 	
 	
 		to have a gun there's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> offenses that are hanging one is to have a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">gun</ENAMEX> and the other is to is to deal in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">narcotics</ENAMEX> and and there's no appeal once you're found guilty the sentence is automatic
 	
 	
 		so i guess they don't have a drug problem over there huh
 	
 	
 		uh well it's interesting they do uh well they do and they don't not like we do here you can't buy it off the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street corners</ENAMEX> but there's so much money to be made in drugs
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that there's a lot of times not for selling in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malaysia</ENAMEX> but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> go to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Thailand</ENAMEX> and they have to bring them through the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX> there the last <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that got hung weren't even trying to sell them there they were just uh caught with them
 	
 	
 		oh no
 	
 	
 		and and and the uh the law says that if you've got a certain quantity on you you're presumed to be a dealer
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh if you're a user the penalty isn't much much less you go to rehabilitation if you're a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealer</ENAMEX> then you get hung but anyway uh they
 		they have some very strong antigun laws there and and uh like it's a hanging offense
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		now uh yeah <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> get broken into and they get slashed up with knives but at least the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> has to be next to you with a knife i mean you can outrun a knife but you can't outrun a gun
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		so uh the violent uh there is not as many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> getting killed in robberies and holdups and things like that as you see here
 		uh that's probably why i've come to that to that way of thinking of course the uh the very emotional uh thinking over what happened to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> you know the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> that got it was mentally deranged since you get one so easily
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh but i'm sure that they get a lot of publicity there's probably a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that get shot with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX> by equally mentally deranged people
 	
 	
 		well um just recently i think it was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Sixty Minutes</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		they had an article uh or uh
 		a news story about uh gun control and in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> they have started something where you know you always have to be eighteen or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twenty one</NUMEX> to buy a gun but um they've started where they do a background check and so
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		after you can go apply for this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">gun</ENAMEX> but it takes like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven days</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		until you can get it and i think that's a good idea you know i'm not for total gun control because i feel like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> need to protect themselves but um i think that you know the background check is a great idea
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah i think it's a i i think it's great and i'm trying to think the uh secret service <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> that got uh injured so badly when he was trying to protect <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		was it Brady yeah
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brady</ENAMEX> and this is the law that's before the the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">legislature</ENAMEX> right now is is referred to as the Brady <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Bill</ENAMEX> right
 	
 	
 		i didn't know about that
 	
 	
 		yeah and and that requires some that would be at the federal level and require some waiting period presumably uh during that waiting period there would be a background uh uh check that would take place
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 		see i think that's great but they also said on this um news story that that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> can sell it to one another
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and they wouldn't have to do the background check and i mean they went on to tell about all the the illegal <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX> and everything and that i think that <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Sixty Minutes</ENAMEX> bought some <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX> and um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		like an <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Uzi</ENAMEX> even and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and so you know there's a lot of controversy and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> walk around at gun shows with their big <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX> on their back saying for sale and you don't have to do any background checking i mean any they would sell it to anybody
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		we you know i wonder i had occasion to go into a pawnshop recently i've never been in one in my life before and uh i was just looking around and and the majority of what they've got in there are guns
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i'll bet they don't i'll bet you don't i i would imagine legitimate gun <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX> you'd have background checks but i'll bet if somebody goes in and offers a pawnshop
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">guy</ENAMEX> some money for a gun
 	
 	
 		enough money that's right
 	
 	
 		he he just picks it up over the counter
 		and and i was i was really surprised that there you can get <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX> of any kind that you want you know the other thing is you had talked about the uh
 		needing a gun to protect yourself and you know maybe someday we're all going to get wiped out by a robber here and then i'll change my mind but
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		there's so many accidents with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> accidentally getting a hold of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah there is
 	
 	
 		uh with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> being out at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> hearing rustling at the door he forgot his key wham he's gone uh i i absolutely don't want <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> in my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> for that reason
 		uh there's just too many things that can happen that are bad
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		well um my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> both have a collection of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX> and um i don't know i guess we we've been taught responsibility when it comes to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX> but accidents always happen but my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> has always keep kept his hid from us i mean even to this day i don't really
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh sure
 		yeah
 		you don't know really you don't know where it is
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right i know where his big gun is like his <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">shotgun</ENAMEX> and stuff but um
 		his <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pistols</ENAMEX> and stuff like that and he keeps those hidden and it is just for our protection it's you know if we did have a prowler he he keeps it like um he has the little rotary dial thing and like
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i think it's the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> shot or the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> shot the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bullet</ENAMEX>'s in there but i mean he'll give them <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> chances
 	
 	
 		oh okay that's that's an interesting thing so uh yeah that the only way that would be a disadvantage if the other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX>'s got a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">gun</ENAMEX> and fires when he sees his and it's on it's on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> shot uh i think that uh uh
 	
 	
 		and um
 		right
 	
 	
 		yeah i i i think that you know <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have legitimate reasons for having them the only problem is so many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have them that don't have legitimate reasons for having them And the other thing is that there are a lot of crimes of passion
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh you know a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> may have one at home for his protection but suddenly uh uh yeah <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> or he gets in an argument with a neighbor and he goes home particularly when we get into the hot <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summers</TIMEX> and
 	
 	
 		his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>
 		that's happening more and more often too
 	
 	
 		oh sure he goes ho me and gets his <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">gun</ENAMEX> out and comes back and shoot them there was a uh
 		uh just recently here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> i'm i'm trying to reconstruct it somebody jumped in front of somebody in line in front of a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven eleven</NUMEX>
 		and they got mad and they had a little argument over it so this one <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> goes home and he is sitting talking to his his uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">huh-uh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> about it and he sees the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> that jumped the line in front of him coming down the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> so they got out and have more words and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> went down to his house <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> down the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> and got a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">gun</ENAMEX> and come back and shot the other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> and killed him
 	
 	
 		oh my gosh
 	
 	
 		and and and when they're available like that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who normally wouldn't do things like that but momentarily fly off the trigger
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		tend to uh uh uh uh tend to do that and then it happens in the in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> a lot it happens in uh uh i i guess
 		at certain times of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> tempers grow short
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and and it happens then and i i uh uh
 		you you know my uh uh oldest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX>'s fiance is a uh is a part part he's a college <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> but he also is a reserve police <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX>
 		and and he uh he has all kinds of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX> and he's taken her out to teach her to shoot
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh uh you know i think that's good because she's not afraid of them and it it teaches her to be responsible relative to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX> but uh when he's out on police work you know he leaves her home alone and shows them where they are
 		in case she needs them and i worry about that i would almost worry about that more than if she didn't have one
 	
 	
 		yeah because she might be um apt to go get it a little quicker than
 	
 	
 		see what i mean yeah
 		uh yeah
 		yeah yeah <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX> i lived in an <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one night</TIMEX> i heard wham and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> it shock the apartment
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh i came out and some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> came flying out of their apartment
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> next to me and they asked me to come in and look and there was chips of wood all over the place
 		and a big hole in the ceiling and a bullet comes to rest on the pillow beside one them's head
 	
 	
 		oh no
 	
 	
 		evidently it had ricocheted around the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room well</ENAMEX> a young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eleven</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years old</TIMEX> uh was living with his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> up <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">above</NUMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girlfriend</ENAMEX> was visiting and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> took the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girlfriend</ENAMEX> home
 		and apparently the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> had uh he had a gun in there for protection so the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> was bored it was a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> fifty <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> magnum and he was sitting there spinning the chamber
 		and it went off and actually shot his toe off and went through the ceiling uh through the his floor which was the ceiling of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> below that and i say ricocheted around the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> a little bit
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it was kind of scary
 	
 	
 		yeah really if it landed on her pillow beside her if she had uh just rolled over
 	
 	
 		yeah and it it it had about spent all it's energy but you could see there was splintered <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wood</ENAMEX> from all the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">places</ENAMEX> that it hit going around the room
 	
 	
 		oh my gosh
 	
 	
 		and and uh so i i uh i i think we're almost coming from the same place on this subject really
 	
 	
 		yeah i do too
 	
 	
 		i i i i think that that we don't want to go to the extreme of banning them completely but we sure want a lot of control then and a lot of protection
 	
 	
 		um i think i would rate probably a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">seven</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah i think i would too i think i would too
 	
 	
 		just because um you're right i think that if we did ban them the bad <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> would still have them
 	
 	
 		yeah  be uh well it's too late hey hey if i were starting my own <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> from the beginning
 	
 	
 		i mean
 	
 	
 		from the beginning i would
 	
 	
 		probably like the country <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malaysia</ENAMEX> is that where you said i mean they started it
 	
 	
 		yeah <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malaysia</ENAMEX> but of course uh it's also true in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Great Britain</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yeah they're not allowed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Great Britain</ENAMEX> either even the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">policemen</ENAMEX> don't carry them the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">policemen</ENAMEX> carry <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clubs</ENAMEX> but don't
 	
 	
 		no i didn't know that
