 
     		
 	
 		okay we're energized um painting interesting uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> called me when she called me the computer called me i thought that they were reading my mind i'm in the middle of um going out for bids to have my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> painted
 	
 	
 		okay
 		oh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">uh</ENAMEX> painting is not hard to do uh as long as it's not in not to the point of where it's uh needs to be scraped and bleeding and peeling
 	
 	
 		no
 		right
 	
 	
 		and our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> is not but it's starting to bleed through and burn through because the paint's real cheap and it's just a hassle to go do it so i'm looking for the easy way out and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah i know did is it easy to find <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painters uh painters</ENAMEX> to do this for you
 	
 	
 		it's easier to find <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painters</ENAMEX> but you have to be you have to be aware of what of how messy they can get and are they gonna put on a good a good two coats and are they gonna caulk exterior
 	
 	
 		right are you talking about outside or inside exterior yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah uh interior's not so bad it's because it's more fun it's more convenient but you get outside where you have high peaks and those kind of things it can be a real issue
 	
 	
 		well
 		yeah
 		well when we've painted um
 		right now our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX> doesn't have to have the same kind of exterior painting there  it's more trim because it has  some of the old <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">asbestos</ENAMEX> shingles
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		on the back and there's some sort of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stone</ENAMEX> or something in the front so there isn't as much <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wood</ENAMEX> that has to be painted um
 		but it it the problem is that it hits the sun hits it so preparing it is a real problem you've got to prepare it well or else it'll flake
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		um-hum  here the
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		some of the home <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">builders</ENAMEX> are they they don't put brick on the side of your <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> to save money so they put up a lot uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">little quarter</TIMEX> inch Masonite basically and they're painted kind of like a spun of some sort and so it's real cheap and uh
 		uh i've had thirteen <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">hundred dollar</NUMEX> bid and i've <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as low as five hundred</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">forty dollars</NUMEX> so it's just a matter of it's
 	
 	
 		wow that's quite a range
 	
 	
 		oh yeah <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> brags about his his piece of equipment he's using and the drop cloths and all that kind crap and i'm not so much worried about that as what
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i don't want it all over the brick and windows and and the
 	
 	
 		yeah which might be a bigger problem than it would be uh yeah absolutely
 	
 	
 		oh sure
 		so y'all you haven't had any any jobs painted in your <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> or recently then
 	
 	
 		no we have uh done a little painting ourselves
 		um we painted a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedroom</ENAMEX> uh well within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last couple of months</TIMEX> um and we have we have some more that need to be done but the
 	
 	
 		just fun
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		the problem that we we've owned this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> almost <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five years</TIMEX> now and  um when we bought it
 		the um it had been vacant for a while because the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> had retired to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arizona</ENAMEX> but the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> was a real estate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> and she was selling it and it'd been lived in briefly by her before she bought her town <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>  so she told us that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX> had been
 		uh professionally painted recently and it looked pretty good you know the interior walls all basically white but they obviously had been done
 		without to much uh wear afterward  the only problem was when we started having the movers move the uh furniture in we identified the various <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> by pieces of masking tape on the wood uh
 		the door frames when we took the masking tape off <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> the painted came with it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		uh that's not very
 	
 	
 		big long strips so what had happened is that professional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painters</ENAMEX> had not prepared the surface properly and some of that still has to be redone
 	
 	
 		oh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> just painted over <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">varnished wood</ENAMEX> oh my
 	
 	
 		yeah well no actually it had been uh it would had been a repaint job
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		but they had not um either they had painted with the wrong kind of paint over top or they hadn't really roughed it up or whatever they would because it was woodwork so it looked as if it had been painted
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		correctly with you know uh an enamel or something but um it had not either that or it had had not been prepared underneath and it was greasy or something
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		it comes off in strips i mean not even little bit so we still have some of that trim work to do because we put it off all this time we know what a job it's gonna be because you almost have to strip the whole thing in order do it again
 	
 	
 		oh no
 		hm
 		i wish you good luck
 	
 	
 		okay  thank you bye
 	
 	
 		thank you very much bye-bye
