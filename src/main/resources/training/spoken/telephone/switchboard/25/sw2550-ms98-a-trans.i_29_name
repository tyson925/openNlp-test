 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		so
 		and i think she was in some of the shows for a while as extra and stuff so
 	
 	
 		yeah that wasn't a very good thing that happened to that family
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		they kind of went in there and took over
 	
 	
 		well what are you going to do they're they're coming to the end of their season uh
 	
 	
 		well that's what i'm doing May <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> i'm going to sit right here watch it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i was going to say there's going to be no more <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> reruns
 	
 	
 		
 
 		actually i haven't watched it much this season in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last couple of years</TIMEX> i've been on that uh downward trend
 	
 	
 		yeah of course they're uh they're probably going to set it up for some kind of sequel or something in the future and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah those TV movies or something
 	
 	
 		yeah it's got to come back
 	
 	
 		it was funny i i spent a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> overseas <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few years ago</TIMEX> and all the TV was i was in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> and all the TV shows were in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Japanese</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but they showed reruns of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> and it was great because i could turn it on and all of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> were very familiar to me and i'd seen all of the shows so i knew what was going on
 	
 	
 		so you didn't need to know the language
 	
 	
 		huh-uh but it it was it was really nice when you move to such a foreign culture to see all these familiar faces
 	
 	
 		how about that
 		true and hear hear the weird voices
 	
 	
 		yeah all those dubs it's terrible
 	
 	
 		it like
 		yeah somebody <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time was talking about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Wayne</ENAMEX> movies with these weird <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> voices and
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it's hard to imagine
 		well what do you think about what's going on on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LA Law</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> it's
 	
 	
 		well i
 	
 	
 		have you seen it <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past couple of weeks</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		i can't remember the last time i saw it
 		i know that um <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Susan Dey</ENAMEX> is with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jimmy Smits</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah and she's pregnant did you know that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and that just
 		she doesn't belong with him
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and that they kicked <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Kuzak</ENAMEX> out
 		did you know that
 	
 	
 		no he's not with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX> anymore
 	
 	
 		no he uh the the i'm trying to remember <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leland</ENAMEX> decided to extend <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brackman</ENAMEX>'s uh
 		reign as a senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and the rest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> all got up in arms about it
 		and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael</ENAMEX> met with them and said and said you know we got to do something about this we need to make a proposal let somebody else be the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> and he kind of elected himself
 		and everybody else went along with it and they they uh gave it to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leland</ENAMEX> and he hit the roof
 		and um
 		he and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brackman</ENAMEX> talked about it and and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brackman</ENAMEX> decided to try and do away with him so he fired him
 		because he he violated one of their policies of going behind a senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX>'s back or something
 		so they fired him they chased him off with the security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guards</ENAMEX>
 		they're fighting out that battle now he's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX> formed his own firm
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		he uh
 		what else did he do he did a lot of nasty nasty stuff behind their back
 		yeah he stole <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grace</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Victor</ENAMEX> they've gone with him um
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		and um
 		who are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">the other two</NUMEX> he stole <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> associates
 	
 	
 		um the
 		the tax <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abby</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jonathan</ENAMEX> he he took <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abby</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jonathan</ENAMEX> with him
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		really
 	
 	
 		yeah and he he went to uh he went to the bank
 		and he took um i can't remember the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> he defended for murder
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Earl</ENAMEX> you know they had a lien against his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> so he'd pay his legal bills
 		do you remember that
 	
 	
 		the the black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		he was a teacher
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		they they they put a lien against his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> so he'd pay his legal bills because it was like <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">four hundred thousand dollars</NUMEX> or something
 	
 	
 		whoa
 	
 	
 		well <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michael</ENAMEX> reduced his legal fees to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">twenty thousand dollars</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so that they cut that out so they they couldn't have a lien on his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> anymore
 		so he did away with that and then he went to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX> because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX> gave him apparently some extra credit because they had that lien
 		well s ince they didn't have the lien anymore they couldn't have the credit from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX> so that that got the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX> in hot water
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and then then <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael</ENAMEX> went to court and and uh petitioned that they needed to go into solvency
 		because they were so financially in bad shape
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh they all showed up in court um <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leland</ENAMEX> was going to try a motion make a motion before that so they ended up both being in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> in front of the judge pleading their case and um
 		i think i think <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael</ENAMEX> was doing it on the one hand and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> that do you remember the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> that that uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grace</ENAMEX> had an affair with the other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> that she had an affair with for a while kind of an older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> she
 	
 	
 		at the firm
 	
 	
 		no he wasn't at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX> he was like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosalyn Chase</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> before
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		it was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier in the season</TIMEX> she had an affair with this other lawyer
 	
 	
 		no i guess i didn't see those
 	
 	
 		and and anyway <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leland Leland</ENAMEX> apparently has hired him on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">now</TIMEX> and he's and he's defending this case
 	
 	
 		jeez
 	
 	
 		and what happened at the end is the judge um
 		um uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael</ENAMEX> wanted wanted the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX> put in receivership
 		and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> wouldn't do it but he said he he's going to give a like a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten day</TIMEX> uh evaluation
 		and he was going to put it in the hands of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">businessman</ENAMEX> to to run it and see if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX> was salvageable or not
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and and both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> had to come up with with lists of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that were suitable to to run it
 		and he rejected both of the lists and came up with his own person
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you'll you'll never guess who this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> is
 	
 	
 		who
 	
 	
 		think of the worst well now it might be hard but think of the the worst <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> that's been on the show
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		in in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past two years</TIMEX>
 		besides <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosalyn</ENAMEX> she's dead and gone
 	
 	
 		yeah she's that was weird  that was very weird
 		um the worst person
 	
 	
 		goofy
 	
 	
 		i don't know
 	
 	
 		you'll never get it it's it's uh
 		was it Roxanne
 	
 	
 		Roxanne the the secretary
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roxanne</ENAMEX>'s ex-husband
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Meyer</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		well he's got a lot of business smarts though
 	
 	
 		yeah i know that's who he put in charge of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX> you
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i think what she did to him was a travesty
 	
 	
 		yeah but he's going to be  he's going to be running the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX> for the next i don't know <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten days</TIMEX> or whatever to evaluate
 	
 	
 		that's funny
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		boy they've really got their uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		talk about a genealogy chart
 	
 	
 		yeah that's pretty pretty strange well they they've already said that um
 		who is it i guess it's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Susan Dey</ENAMEX> and and uh
 		whoever plays <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kuzak</ENAMEX> isn't coming back <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</TIMEX> so some of this some of this has to do with why they're not coming back i guess
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well is um
 		the tax <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> still married married
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		they're going to stay there in fact um
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Susan Dey</ENAMEX> and and uh
 		the the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> had had a confrontation about it
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		why why they didn't invite them
 		and and the the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kuzak</ENAMEX> founded is just a litigation firm
 		and they said well we wanted we wanted you but we didn't really want <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stuart</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 		because he's not a litigationist and we didn't figure you you would come without him and and we're going to be fighting against each other so
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so it's just kind of weird
 	
 	
 		that that's a weird marriage
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		they're married in real life
 	
 	
 		i know
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i know
 	
 	
 		they've had i was surprised when they started having big problems and then i only caught part of the episode where he went on that uh nature deal
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and and he got real into it i guess
 	
 	
 		yeah  yeah
 		that was kind of bizarre
 		yeah it's interesting to talk about their marriage their marriage in real life because she had breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> and that
 	
 	
 		oh she did
 	
 	
 		yeah and that was real tough for him and there were some times on the show where there were some real emotional things going on with the
