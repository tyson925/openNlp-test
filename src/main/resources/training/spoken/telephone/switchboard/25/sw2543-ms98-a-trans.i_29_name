 
     		
 	
 		
 
 		okay what kind of music do you like
 	
 	
 		well i um <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several years ago</TIMEX> a radio broke in my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> and i never i got out of the habit of listening to the radio and so
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i haven't been listening i i used to just listen to the rock <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stations</ENAMEX> but um  lately i have been going back to classical music i don't really know what
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		too many of the most popular songs are unless you know they're in the the news or something but um so i tend to listen to some of the older
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		songs that were popular back when i was paying attention and then i like some classical music and some of the
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		pieces that have been around a while i haven't paid much attention to most of the current music what about you
 	
 	
 		um i listen i listen to a wide variety of music sometimes i'll turn on the classical music sometimes i'll listen to jazz uh every <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">now</TIMEX> and then <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> and western um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i'll listen to some of the rock <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stations</ENAMEX> i also like the uh the the classic rock <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stations</ENAMEX> that play the older more mellow type
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		rock music um some of the some of the rock <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stations</ENAMEX> now are the i guess the top <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">forty stations</ENAMEX> or whatever they just it really gets on my nerves because they play so many commercials and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		sometimes the deejays are just kind of annoying and irritating and uh it gets kind of old and they play the same songs over and over and i just get kind of tired of all that
 	
 	
 		that's true
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so lots of times i'll just play cassettes instead of listening to the radio actually but uh most of my cassettes i guess i don't i don't like hard rock
 	
 	
 		
 
 		no
 	
 	
 		um i have some some rock and some jazz and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> of maybe one or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> and western some uh
 		oh i can't believe i can't think of his name um <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Garth Brooks</ENAMEX> i have a couple of his tapes
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but it's mainly it's mainly just the the light rock type stuff
 	
 	
 		yes i don't i never liked any of the heavy metal music  i never really listened to it because i you know i prefer to have more i guess an established pattern of
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		music to listen to but and i back <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a long time ago</TIMEX> when the rap music first came out it was kind of a novelty and i listened to some of it but i you know now that there's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">just a million</NUMEX> rap <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and uh they try to tend to try to do outdo each other with raciness i think and
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		so i you know i'm not attracted to that at all but um it made a big difference in my life not to have a radio that was a easy access and so now that i do have one i just don't automatically turn it on
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		unless there's something i'm particularly listening to but you know if you go <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two or three years</TIMEX> without having that what i got the most exposure to
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it really changed my lifestyle and kept me from
 		just having a you know easy access to current music and so i did like i say tend to go back to
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">albums</ENAMEX> and cassettes and things that i had already had purchased but we don't have a CD yet do you
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		no i don't
 		i sure don't because i have so many albums and cassettes i feel like gosh i have to go out and buy a CD <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">player</ENAMEX> and then start collecting CDs and it just i haven't gotten around to doing it yet
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah i i kind of decided to wait until it it was around a while it was kind of like remember when personal calculators first came out and they were really really expensive and then now you can get one for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two or three</NUMEX> dollars
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		just like VCRs too  yeah i thought of that too that if i wait it'll get a lot less expensive and i can do without it for a while
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">sure</ENAMEX> and also they get better quality with and they learn to have more features and things and without and making them less expensive so we're kind of waiting
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		to like uh now you know and the price of cassettes has gone down because CDs are so popular so
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		that's and a CD is a lot more expensive than a cassette ever was too right now i think
 	
 	
 		i haven't even priced them i guess they must be
 	
 	
 		they're somewhere between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> and fifteen <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">dollars</NUMEX> a piece
 	
 	
 		oh really that is awful
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		i bought some at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> time for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> of mine that have CD <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX> i thought my gosh now i know another reason why i'm not going to get a CD <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">player</ENAMEX> for a while
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 		take our time well i can't imagine um you can't record on them and so
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		they won't be as functional as like a cassette <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">player</ENAMEX> where if you heard something
 		you could record it you know uh if you have i guess if you wanted to record something to play out in your <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> or something that you'd heard or that you owned an album of so CDs won't be nearly as handy
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah see i've got a on my stereo i've got a a uh turntable and then i've got a dual cassette so i can record off other cassettes
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but i never realized you couldn't record onto CD i just never really thought about it because i haven't really looked into it very much i don't have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> and and i've never really looked at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> very closely but that that would be inconvenient because i have a cassette <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">player</ENAMEX> in my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> now i guess
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know one of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these days</TIMEX> when i get a new car maybe i guess all of them probably will have CDs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX> by then but uh i'm not planning on doing that for a while i just got mine paid off so i'm going to stick with the cassettes and and uh you know until
 	
 	
 		yes  enjoy it
 	
 	
 		until they now my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> my younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> has a she does have a CD <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">player</ENAMEX> that she got for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> and she's got the the cassette so she can record off cassettes onto CDs i mean i'm sorry other way around off CDs onto cassettes um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		well that's good
 	
 	
 		so i can record some things from her and you know get cassettes and record off other ones or off the radio if i want to but
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but um i just haven't gone to CD yet
 	
 	
 		why we haven't either but we you know we like the
 		the idea of having great um extra quality you know in your music and things but but i'm satisfied to just have what i've been used to not have to think about the great financial
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		sacrifice that that would be to suddenly try to switch over to all CDs or something but i know one thing that has colored my music choice is
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		when we had <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> um i really started to think about what kind of television programs i was watching and what kind of music i was listening to and activities because um you know i just didn't want them to be exposed to
 	
 	
 		right
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		a lot of things and a lot of the lot of the songs have some lyrics that um i just wasn't pleased with you know
 	
 	
 		oh yeah  and they get worse and worse too
 	
 	
 		um-hum and so i really think we've tried to tone down
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		our taste there to make uh you know our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> not be exposed to so many negative negative things so early in life
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		well that's amazing how i used to when i was in college i used to have the stereo on all the time or i had on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTV</ENAMEX> or something but ever since i've been out of college
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i guess over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last several years</TIMEX>
 		i listen to the stereo less and less now i will turn on i've got a small jam box in my bathroom i'll turn that on while i'm in the shower and while i'm getting ready because there's really not much else i can do and it's kind of boring standing there putting on makeup so i'll turn the radio on and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		right
 	
 	
 		and then i listen to it when i'm in the car driving to work because again there's you know there's nothing else going on i might as well listen to the radio while i'm driving to work but other than that i've i really don't
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i don't listen to the radio or even to my albums or cassettes or anything very often anymore i guess i'm just too busy doing other things that it's
 		too much trouble to get up and go decide what i want to listen to and put it on the on the turntable i don't know i just don't don't bother to do it very much anymore
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yes i know what you mean i i know my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> he um
 		plays an instrument and he played in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> when he was in college and in high school and so he has a lot of all different kinds of music and he goes out of his way to play marching band music or
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		like you say jazz or classical to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> to to give them some exposure to different kinds of music and i think that's really good because they're learning to like all different kinds and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		that's good what instrument does he play
 	
 	
 		he plays the it's a euphonium it's like a small
 		a really small not a tuba but
 		i think it's hard to explain  i never had known anyone to play <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one</TIMEX> before but it's kind of like a small small tuba but it's not the kind that sits up on your shoulder
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		uh-huh i've never heard of that
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but it's a cross between a tuba and and an and you know a horn it's a brass instrument
 	
 	
 		
  
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so he plays that and and a little bit of piano and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but he has some real fond memories of marching <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		concert band type
 		activities and he thinks that'd be good for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um-hum oh i'm sure it is i'm sure it is i was exposed to a lot of music when i was younger i my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> had me take piano lessons for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eight years</TIMEX> and
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
  
 		so i was i was a real good piano <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">player</ENAMEX> but then i got interested in a lot of other things and i got real involved in many things and
 		and now i don't have a piano in my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> or anything i could sit back down and play a few things but not like i used to be able to it's kind of sad that i've let that slip away
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i took guitar lessons i think for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one or two years</TIMEX> and uh
 		that was about the same time i was taking piano and then i got too busy in high school to really keep up with it between homework
