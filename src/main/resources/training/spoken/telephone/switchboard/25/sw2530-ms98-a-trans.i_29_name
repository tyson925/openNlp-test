 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> is his birthday yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		oh is it really
 		oh how old
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>

 		my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX>'s expecting her first <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this month</TIMEX> say yes
 	
 	
 		oh really oh how exciting  that could it's always
 	
 	
 		so our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> are all grown up
 	
 	
 		do they live close by
 	
 	
 		just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of them
 	
 	
 		the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> that's going to have the baby well that's good you that will be your new hobby then  taking care of grandbaby
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		um my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX>'s going to have a baby <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this summer</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so but i guess that's a little off the subject
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i don't know i've tried various things i've tried to get interested in things like refinishing furniture woodworking or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">um ceramics</ENAMEX> but it just seems like
 		it's so expensive to break into something new
 	
 	
 		um
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		that um you know with my i've got quite enough of an investment in my photography equipment
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that
 	
 	
 		we we had for a while done uh well we still do a lot of picture taking in that and uh we're in the process of putting our <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">eight millimeter</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh films and now the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> and i were going to put them on video
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and we're we're in the process of doing that right now and
 	
 	
 		are you doing that yourself
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		how do you do it
 	
 	
 		uh we bought the equipment
 		uh that you do it with
 	
 	
 		you don't have to
 		i mean is the something that you don't have to see it as you it's not like your
 	
 	
 		well the you buy this little little piece of equipment and you use your video camera of course and uh your projector
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		oh okay that's what i wondered
 	
 	
 		and the combination you the way you connect you know connect them up
 	
 	
 		do they make good quality copies do you think
 	
 	
 		uh i think it's going to we were a little worried there was a lot of background noise on it but uh
 		we can hook it into our uh stereo system after we get the pictures all done
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		we can hook it into our uh a video or uh stereo system and uh put music
 		to the film and that will cut out all the background the noise of the uh recorder running and that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh
 		well that's nice
 	
 	
 		because the projector made a lot makes a lot of noise
 	
 	
 		yeah i remember those we've never had one my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> never had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> but um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and uh so that's been kind and our darkroom is very we have a darkroom but it's very dusty
 	
 	
 		oh
 		that's my dream i guess is to have my own darkroom
 	
 	
 		
 
 		we we're real active in it for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a long time</TIMEX> but you know you get busy and
 	
 	
 		yeah um
 	
 	
 		the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> grow up and
 	
 	
 		they're expensive to maintain just the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemicals</ENAMEX> are expensive
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		we mainly just did a bit of black and white it's
 	
 	
 		yeah i would still like black and white
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		to me black and white is photography color is more snapshot
 	
 	
 		oh you can really get some good really good pictures in black and white
 	
 	
 		yeah you really can <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> don't realize that
 	
 	
 		that
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		not realize that black and white it nowadays it's actually more expensive than uh color
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		it's hard to even find film or anything
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		but uh
 	
 	
 		and i well i used to i learned how to knit when i was little my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandmother</ENAMEX> knitted a lot
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and she knitted all the time
 	
 	
 		did she
 	
 	
 		and uh before she passed away and made some beautiful things but i've never really learned how to do more than the basic
 	
 	
 		oh that's great
 		yeah
 		yeah i don't do a whole it uh time seems to be hard to find for anything you want to do i don't know why
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you
 	
 	
 		yeah i know
 	
 	
 		you'd think i'd have a lot of time but
 	
 	
 		yeah you'd think i would too but you know
 	
 	
 		
 
 		but i i i'm knitting an afghan for the baby and i haven't worked on this for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several weeks</TIMEX>  i just haven't got back to it

 		i really really have trouble finding time i did did some toll painting for a while and i started doing a still life and it's it never got finished

 		that's something i've
 		it's interesting to me <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who watch <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who are that know how to paint i just felt like that's something i've never been very good at or very good at drawing or anything
 	
 	
 		well had have you watched any of these things on TV these large brush
 	
 	
 		i've watched uh i've yeah here and there but they make it look uh i i know that

 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		well once you start it apparently it's not bad some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> have gone into the call age <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Claritin University</ENAMEX> is just not too far from here
