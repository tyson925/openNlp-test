 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hi Rick</ENAMEX> how you doing
 	
 	
 		pretty good
 	
 	
 		you say you live in your own <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> or you do not
 	
 	
 		no i don't i'm uh renting a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">townhouse</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">right now</TIMEX> but i'm moving uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of May</TIMEX> i'm going to move into renting a house
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		wow i've i've never heard of that before
 	
 	
 		i'm uh
 		well actually this will be the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> time i've done it
 	
 	
 		how does
 	
 	
 		i am uh in grad school right now
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and on my kind of salary you just  it's kind of hard to come up with money to make a house payment
 	
 	
 		well i i'll bet you end up spending more money renting a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> than you would if you put a down payment on it and and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah well down payment is a tough problem i guess
 	
 	
 		yeah if you can get by that hurdle
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i can remember when i uh when i brought my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> i needed help
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX> helped me out to get started and now my rent uh well my mortgage if you will is uh cheaper than uh you know one room uh apartments
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well
 		i don't know you're in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Massachusetts</ENAMEX> i think the the market is a little bit different here
 	
 	
 		it's a lot cheaper in uh in uh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh no i'm in i'm in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Raleigh North Carolina</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh oh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Carolina</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh
 		it's probably what i'm paying now for an <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> is <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">six twenty five</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and this this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> we're moving into is <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">only five hundred dollars</NUMEX> a month
 	
 	
 		so you'll actually be saving money
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		how about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utilities</ENAMEX> for the uh for the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> that you're in now
 	
 	
 		well the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> now is is uh it's got a heat pump
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so it's it's kind i mean it's not that cold in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Raleigh</ENAMEX> in the wintertime but
 		i mean the air conditioning is probably your biggest threat
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">place</ENAMEX> doesn't have air conditioning and has gas heating so it's going to be i know it's going to be cheaper
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		maybe hotter but
 	
 	
 		i i uh probably make you sick if i told you what my uh my mortgage is with with the taxes
 	
 	
 		yeah i can imagine i know how things are up there
 	
 	
 		i'm paying uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two hundred</NUMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> dollars a month
 	
 	
 		what
 	
 	
 		with taxes
 	
 	
 		what
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i bought
 	
 	
 		you have some kind of deal
 	
 	
 		no no deal it when i bought my home uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty five years ago</TIMEX> it was it was very expensive
 	
 	
 		oh oh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty five years ago</TIMEX> okay yeah that makes
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm an old i'm an old guy
 	
 	
 		well that makes it more my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> have the same kind of deal too
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		they've had their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> that long
 	
 	
 		well it works that way with uh with anybody who buys it's very difficult when you first buy your <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> uh but once but once you do that and hang on to it you'd be surprised what inflation does to uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		to the housing market and even though we're in a slump right now it's not going to last forever it's going to catch up sooner or later and uh you got you got to live in a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">some day</TIMEX> uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah see the problem i have now is uh i i want mobile because i'm not really
 		sure what is going to happen <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> from now i've moved like
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last two years</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		when you rent the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> do they uh force you to lease and guarantee payment
 	
 	
 		uh yeah they usually do put a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> lease on it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i was living in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colorado</ENAMEX> and i didn't have a lease which was really nice
 	
 	
 		oh the the lease
 	
 	
 		but i just kind of a verbal agreement yeah i'm going to stay a year and i'll be nice to you  if you'll be nice to me
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		the the lease can work uh work <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> ways it can work to your benefit too where uh they can't increase your your rent uh if something goes wrong with with a written lease but with an oral lease they can so it works both ways
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		yeah huh well what would you suggest think it would be a good idea even i think i might be moving to buy a house
 	
 	
 		well buying a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> is is should be your ultimate goal because you're going to have to live somewhere
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh even if uh if you hang on to it for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five years</TIMEX> put a little bit of uh uh money into it you're going to get it back again
 		with uh with premium just like putting money in a bank it's forced forced savings
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 		if uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know living in a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> is something you're going to have to do whether you you're doing it alone whether you're doing it with a with a a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> or you're going to have to you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah see i'm single <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">now and</TIMEX> and see i may be going back and getting a PhD
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i know i can't afford a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> if i'm going to be doing that
 	
 	
 		you you sound like a young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> and and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm i'm <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty five</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		all right when i was uh in my early <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty twenty one twenty</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years old</TIMEX> i was working for a a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> in a gas station
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and he tried to convince me to buy this single family <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> that he saw for sale and uh
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		uh the price will sound odd because it was uh you know about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty years ago</TIMEX> but it they wanted uh <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">forty nine hundred dollars</NUMEX> for it
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		and the buying a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> was the last thing that i wanted to do
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so i didn't buy it and i'm sorry now because I i you know i wasted a lot of money uh when you're <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty twenty one twenty</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years old</TIMEX> you you throw it away you and i wasn't paying rent i was living at home
 	
 	
 		you wish you did
 		paying it on rent
 		oh well that's the ideal thing
 	
 	
 		but uh but you know  i was throwing my money away
 		with that on girls <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> you know typical things
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i had to waste a lot of money on my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> that was the biggest mistake i ever bought
 	
 	
 		
 
 		you buy a car it depreciates you buy a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> and it inpreciates it it it
 	
 	
 		i know it was the s tupidest thing i why didn't someone tell me that
 	
 	
 		
 
 		you you buy a car uh and have it <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a week</TIMEX> and you've lost <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of it already
 	
 	
 		i know i bought a a brand new i bought a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jeep</ENAMEX>
 		with everything on it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>

 		i see i was i was up there <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> got married in Duxbury
 	
 	
 		and
 		the housing market up here is uh is really slumped so you can buy a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> relatively inexpensive right now
 	
 	
 		huh
 		Raleigh well uh have you ever do you read uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US News</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		no i don't
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Raleigh</ENAMEX> was in the top <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twenty five</NUMEX> housing market
 		i mean it was a good place to buy a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> but the problem is that the average <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> cost is really high
 	
 	
 		what about the tax structure
 	
 	
 		it's i mean it's it's good to buy a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> if you have the money it's just that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> are like
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two hundred</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">three hundred thousand dollar</NUMEX> houses
 	
 	
 		wow what is the tax structure like up there how much a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">thousand</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		i'm i'm not really sure to tell you the truth
 	
 	
 		as my uh
 	
 	
 		being a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">renter</ENAMEX> not even caring about that
 	
 	
 		you don't care about that huh
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		my uh my taxes
 		exceed my mortgage payment
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		
 
 		it wasn't like that when i first
 	
 	
 		that's like my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> where the insurance is almost  you go to the
 	
 	
 		yeah i can imagine it wasn't like that when i <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> bought my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> uh
 		this gentleman that i was talking to when i did buy my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> told me that's what happened to him
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		and uh this was you know <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty years ago</TIMEX> and it's happening to me my tax is exceeding my mortgage payment
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i'm paying a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundred and twenty one</NUMEX> dollars a month
 		uh i've got another uh year to pay on my house
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		and my my uh taxes are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred</NUMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five</TIMEX>
 		
 
 	
 	
 		wow that that just doesn't seem to make make any sense why if you have to tax something for something you already own
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah but they're going to tax you just like they tax you your <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">automobile</ENAMEX> they're going to tax your home
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and then you've got maintenance expenses but the overall cost is is a a lot cheaper now and where you're single now's the time to do it when you're married you know got to have time you're not going to have money you're not going to have
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well i did see a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> for sale in the area i wanted to move into but
 		i don't know where i could come up with the down payment
 	
 	
 		what is what the
 		what is the down payments look like now <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty five</TIMEX> percent
 	
 	
 		i don't know
 		i don't know

 		yeah
 	
 	
 		although the computer uh science areas are booming right now but the uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		the thing that's holding everything back right now is the economy
