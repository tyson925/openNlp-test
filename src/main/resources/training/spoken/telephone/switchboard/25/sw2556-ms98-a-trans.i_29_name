 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> are you big into lawn and garden work
 	
 	
 		well um i just bought a home so i've just now went out and purchased my brand new <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">lawn mower</ENAMEX> and um so i've been assembling it and haven't had a chance to get out there and and test it out
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well do you is it a new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> or
 	
 	
 		no it's um uh it's an older <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> and uh so it already has the the yard's already been established um but
 		there have like big oak <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> in the front and so the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">grass</ENAMEX> is not growing out underneath the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">oak trees</ENAMEX> so i'm have to get out there and do something about that you know spread some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seed</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fertilizer</ENAMEX> and stuff
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		okay i think one of the
 		some of the problems with uh oak <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> is their leaves tend to accumulate and they leach a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> into the soil
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so i found that when i had a uh wooded lot that i needed to put a lot of lime out
 	
 	
 		oh okay okay
 	
 	
 		to uh neutralize the uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">uh oak leaves</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but there's still a problem that uh the shade from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> just uh grass cannot grow
 	
 	
 		right
 		right right
 	
 	
 		and uh one of the things that uh we did uh just we sort of made a little garden that uh surrounded the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> and planted uh pachysandra
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		which is a a shade <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> that seems to do well underneath the trees
 	
 	
 		hm that's an idea
 	
 	
 		yeah so that saved the bare spots and uh you know also eliminated mowing the uh that area of the lawn
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah that's true that's true yeah i have um in between the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sidewalk</ENAMEX> see are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">oak trees</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and then there's one uh sitting on the right uh facing the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> on the right hand side in the middle of that whole section and then i have this whole section over there that has nothing in it at all but just just the grass
 		so that may be an idea to do is uh because i've got that concentration of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> right there is to uh you know just do something like what you said was to put some kind of um uh little <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> that does well in shade uh the shaded area
 		and forget about you know trying to plant <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">grass</ENAMEX> and stuff underneath that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		the other thing too is that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">oak trees</ENAMEX> have those acorns and i don't know if i'm uh going to have to go out there and if i can rake those up or if i'm going to have to pick them all up by hand or what
 	
 	
 		i don't think there's it's it's an impossible task
 	
 	
 		well i know but if you saw how many acorns were sitting up under there you'd see it looks like an impossible task  but we have um um <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> has a lot of the um uh wooden fenced in back yards
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		for privacy fence so i did buy a a <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">weed</ENAMEX> eater too and uh so i could get you know around uh around the wooden fences and um uh you know get all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">weeds</ENAMEX> and stuff up out of there
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well one of the things you may need come fall is a leaf blower or a leaf vacuum
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		because i've you know my wooded lot at my previous house uh i didn't have to mow the lawn very often because it didn't grow that fast
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but in the fall i had to spend <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of weekends</TIMEX> out there on you know two separate <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekends</TIMEX> just getting rid of leaves
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		wow so what what did you did did you use do you have a blower or did you have the uh the vacuum
 	
 	
 		well i had a a leaf vacuum to pick them up and uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		in the front yard i would uh just drive up to the curb and drop them at the curb the uh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">county</ENAMEX> had a pickup service for leaves dropped at the curb
 	
 	
 		huh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and for the back i would uh vacuum them up and then put them on a tarp and drag the tarp out front to to dump them
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		wow
 	
 	
 		and springtime you have to use bags to pack them
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh uh</ENAMEX>-huh yeah that i've never i don't think i've ever seen um a a vacuum though for the for the lawn i know i've seen the blowers
 	
 	
 		yeah well uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Craftsman</ENAMEX> put out a uh leaf vacuum <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few years back</TIMEX> craftsman <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sears</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roebuck</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		who was it
 		oh Craftsman uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh i think it was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about two hundred dollars</NUMEX> or something like that it was a very powerful machine
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		and it would have a tendency to pick up some of the uh acorns if they didn't get uh pressed into the ground
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh</ENAMEX> ooh that'd be good i think that's that's my problem is i i couldn't believe uh uh because uh i guess the other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> they weren't really outdoor type <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> because the lawn really needs to be
 		i have uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">bushes</ENAMEX> and stuff that really need trimming and um so uh
 		so i'm just thinking how in the world i was going to have to scrape up all those uh acorns that are sitting out there they even have some little trees growing
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		because they just left them the acorns i guess sit rather than raking them up um so you know i'm going to have to get out there and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but it was interesting i had to go buy a hoe and a rake i mean the whole works because i've i've lived in an <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> for so long i've never had that kind of equipment so that was that was interesting to go down there and and get all that kind of stuff
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah it's especially delightful moving from an <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> to a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> so that you you can have a little piece of turf you can call your own
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right right so this has been uh this has been an experience for me
 		and uh uh but i i can't wait until we have uh uh some more time to get out there in the front yard and and really do uh you know a lot of landscaping
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		because i want to cut down all the the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> that they or the little <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">shrubs</ENAMEX> that they have because some of them are like um
 		they have the new uh green leaves i don't if it's getting green up there where you are uh but they're almost fully
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">blossomed</ENAMEX> and but there are like sides of them where there're like whole dead uh portions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">shrubs</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh so i've been debating of whether or not just to cut out the dead portions or you know just to take it all out and i think i've pretty well decided just to take it all out and start all over again
 	
 	
 		well you better price the new <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">shrubs</ENAMEX> before you do that
 	
 	
 		i'm just going to get the little baby <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">shrubs</ENAMEX>  the little baby ones you know take <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several years</TIMEX> to grow  there um
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		well it's not too bad i mean i i i thought they were pretty reasonable but i don't know i have nothing really to compare it with uh you know <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">five dollars</NUMEX> for a for a shrub
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i don't know and uh i hadn't really wanted to get that many you know to put out there i i much prefer flowers
 	
 	
 		well my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> got carried away <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this past year</TIMEX> and uh she cleared out a lot of the existing gardens and replanted with new things
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i think she spent over a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">thousand dollars</NUMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> and uh and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fertilizers</ENAMEX> and mulch and everything else and it's it's not hard to go through the money doing that
 	
 	
 		wow
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		um-hum wow
 		it's true it's true just just picking up the equipment that i have
 		you know and and and i didn't blink an eyelash that's what got to me when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> you know said and that'll be <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">five hundred</NUMEX> and something dollars you know with my my big new <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">lawn mower</ENAMEX> and stuff i was just okay you know so yeah you're right you're right you can i think you can go through quite a bit of money
 		i think it depends too where you buy it from if you buy it from a nursery or um we have like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Home Depot</ENAMEX> here i don't know if you have that there is
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		we don't have that here we've we've got some uh local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">nurseries</ENAMEX> that are pretty fair on price but still in the metropolitan area they they hold a gun to your head while they while you write out your check
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		local
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		there you go that's right that's true i understand that
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well it was nice talking to you
 	
 	
 		all right good luck with your new home
 	
 	
 		well thank you
 	
 	
 		and uh nice talking to you
 	
 	
 		oh okay talk to you bye
 	
 	
 		bye
