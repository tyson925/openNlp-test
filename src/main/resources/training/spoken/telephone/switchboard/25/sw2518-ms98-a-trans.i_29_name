 
     		
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		okay exercise is something that i don't do enough of and i have an incredible uh
 		setup at home that i that i have available to me that i should use and um in fact i'm trying to get back into it <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</TIMEX> i have a treadmill a treadmill and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		a a exercise bicycle plus a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> i could go walk and  a whole lot of things like that
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well it sounds like you're you have the stuff there
 	
 	
 		i have the stuff there i don't have the motivation all the time
 	
 	
 		yeah well well i uh go to aerobics twice a week which i started a little over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> ago
 	
 	
 		so how about you
 		oh that's good
 	
 	
 		and i i think that's probably pretty good for me um i part of my incentive when i started was to try to lose <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a few pounds</NUMEX> because i had a special reason you know i wanted to and had a lot of motivation which
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i did but then you know i just gradually come back up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a few</NUMEX> pounds anyway which is no big deal i'm not
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		over weight or anything but you know how you always want to lose a few and
 	
 	
 		yeah uh never happy
 	
 	
 		i've found that now i i think if i didn't do the aerobics then i'd probably have to do something else because i'd probably gain weight you know because i
 	
 	
 		yeah that's the one thing about if you exercise enough or or even a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a a moderate</NUMEX> amount you don't really have to be that concerned about your diet if you just eat normally and then don't over eat but you can
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		because if you don't exercise then it seems like um what you you just have to be really really careful about what you eat you can you can eat like a normal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> if you get a moderate amount of exercise and not really have to worry about it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well i've never paid a whole lot of attention to my diet but
 	
 	
 		but
 		really
 	
 	
 		you know i feel guilty all the time because oh i shouldn't be eating that
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well you must you must not have a weight problem at all
 	
 	
 		not really uh i mean i would just like to be you know <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">five or six pounds</NUMEX> thinner but i don't consider that to be that big a deal
 	
 	
 		yeah that
 		no no but how often do you go to aerobics
 	
 	
 		twice a week
 	
 	
 		you do and you've been pretty faithful about that
 	
 	
 		yes uh in fact i probably haven't missed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than five</TIMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> times in as i say about a year and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three months</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		and that's for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an hour</TIMEX> each time you go well that's that's good
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah i i think it's you know at first it it was kind of a drag because i was not used to doing that much of anything and um
 	
 	
 		that's really good
 	
 	
 		i had been going to school and doing a lot of just you know sitting and studying and and really not working out at all but uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		now as long as i keep going it's it's not that difficult to do and i can see where you know different muscles and things are in better shape
 	
 	
 		oh my muscles are horrible that's the main reason i really ought to be doing something like that because <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mine</ENAMEX>'s not so so much uh weight i mean i have
 		i i if i had lost if i lost <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> pounds i'd think of myself as nice and thin but uh most of it is just you know it's just in bad shape
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so but i it was i i know how i felt so tired <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> was for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time in in a quite a while i took my <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> for a walk and it was incredible how much more energy and how much better i felt last night
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		so uh you know if if uh if if you can just remember even though you don't i don't particularly enjoy it at the time the benefits are just
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh just in you know far far out weigh the
 	
 	
 		yeah there's sometimes sometimes sometimes when i go to aerobics and i get all hot you know it's too warm in this place where we go and everything and i'm thinking why am i doing this
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		
  
 	
 	
 		but like i say it just kind of becomes a habit and it's if if you don't break that cycle very often then you keep doing it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		well it sounds like you're you're uh you know got it got it well in hand i i just i go great <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few weeks</TIMEX> and then i something something something happens that disrupts my schedule and then i just find excuses and the next thing you know you're not doing anything
 	
 	
 		yeah well i think one thing too that makes this easier for me is that i uh do this at a recreation <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> and it takes me <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about three minutes</TIMEX> to drive up there
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		if i had to go you know <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">several miles</NUMEX> if it took me <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> or fifteen or <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty minutes</TIMEX> each way i probably would quit doing it
 	
 	
 		do you go right after work
 	
 	
 		no uh in fact that's kind of uh one of the things that's uh funny about it is i go at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">eight o'clock at night</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		yeah and you'd think well who wants to get up and go then but um it's really not been that much of a problem
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		so it's during the week
 	
 	
 		
  
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you go during the week
 	
 	
 		yeah well my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> and i were also doing quite a bit of walking but we got off of that a little bit
 		uh mostly you know with the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter months</TIMEX> and all it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		seems like there are too many reasons that you can't go because of the weather and things and
 	
 	
 		does he go to have an exercise program too
 	
 	
 		not really and he needs to but uh he's a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CPA</ENAMEX> so at the moment he's snowed under until after tax <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX> but i'm definitely going to get him back on something because he has a few
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		kind of nagging health things that i think you know some more exercise would help
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		so yours is a class an aerobics <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> that you go to
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		but some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> i guess are not too comfortable doing that but
 	
 	
 		yeah we've had a couple of them in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> and oh uh they've kind of stuck with it one of them though has been coming with his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girlfriend</ENAMEX> and they're about to get married in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of weeks</TIMEX> so it might be interesting to see if they stick with it
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but um i also swim quite a bit in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX> time
 	
 	
 		gosh you work you sound like my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> i have a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nevada</ENAMEX> who who is really into i mean she's very athletic anyway she always has been she was the athletic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> and she swims and she
 		you know cross country skis and does all this stuff it sounds like you sound like the same type
 	
 	
 		well i'm not gung ho you know i but i'm not opposed to any of of you know kinds of things i just don't do a lot of them
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know it's tough to to work everything in that you want to accomplish and i have a lot of other interests
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well uh it's too bad we can't talk about your other interests but we just have to talk about exercise
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so well keep up the good work and i'm going to i'm going to
 	
 	
 		well
 		well you'll have to  start working on your machines because that's nice that you have those things
 	
 	
 		well i told a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> of mine whose got a real she really does have a weight problem i said well i have an exercise bike that's sitting over here that's collecting dust and i i have my treadmill and i have a rowing machine
 		and a trampoline i said i'll come over <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this afternoon</TIMEX> and you can borrow the the exercise the exercise bicycle at least maybe it'll get some use so um you know we're going to try to she's got
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about fifty pounds</NUMEX> that she needs to lose so uh you know even though that sounds that's bad it it may be easier for her to lose that for me to lose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> then for me to lose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so i'm i'm going to you know try to help her and that will kind of help to get me you know make me want to do things too so yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah that might be good i have a a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> who uh needed to lose a lot of weight and she and uh another
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> of hers decided to start walking and they were doing i don't know several miles <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">each night</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> she really got the weight off yeah really
 	
 	
 		really
 		yeah kind of kind of having a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a</NUMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buddy</ENAMEX> or somebody to kind of stir you on and and
 		you know keep your motivation level up too i think sometimes might help so i was thinking maybe your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> would you know maybe the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of y'all i mean if he had come on let's go or you you know and y'all kind of did it together in a way that helps
 	
 	
 		well yeah
 		yeah it it helps a lot with the walking because otherwise it's just plain boring
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh to me at least i don't like to go out by myself but that's when we do the most talking and you know about things that have taken place during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> and
 	
 	
 		that's yeah
 	
 	
 		all sorts of things that i don't think you know we typically do  we don't take that much time to talk
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		
  
 		well maybe if the with the weather getting so nice and
 	
 	
 		so
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		after you come home from aerobics make him go for a walk with you  while you cool down
 	
 	
 		well i enjoyed talking to you all right bye-bye
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well you too bye-bye
