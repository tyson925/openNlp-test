 
     		
 	
 		
  
 		so do you fish
 	
 	
 		oh yeah my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> has a lake <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cabin</ENAMEX> and so we go there for the small lake uh
 		just outside of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas Fort Worth</ENAMEX> area it takes us <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about three hours</TIMEX> to get there and we go and we fish and we catch a bunch of junk  nothing nothing to talk about for the most part but it's fun
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> from a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> or from shore
 	
 	
 		from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dock</ENAMEX> from shore
 	
 	
 		oh that's nice uh
 		mostly <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">catfish</ENAMEX> or
 	
 	
 		oh mostly we catch carp if we're doing good we catch a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">catfish</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> once in a while and you know we go ahead and eat those but we've never caught enough to really have what you'd call a fish fry what we normally do is just uh go ahead and clean it up and then uh
 		you know put it in a bag and freeze it and and somebody takes it home and eats it then when there's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">just a couple</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> instead of a whole <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX> usually there's a pretty good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX> there so we don't ever catch enough to eat carp is usually pretty much fun
 		because i've caught up to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about an eight pound</NUMEX> carp on a little you know a little pole with <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty</TIMEX> pound test line and that that's a pretty good fight so that's a lot of fun
 	
 	
 		yeah a real light line real light <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rig well</ENAMEX> that sounds like fun
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		they fight hard
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colorado</ENAMEX> so different than that mostly trout
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		in the mountains
 	
 	
 		yeah and in the rivers and stuff
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah mountain streams and rivers
 	
 	
 		are they good to eat
 	
 	
 		uh yeah very yeah there isn't much there you know
 	
 	
 		oh you mean size wise they're not very big
 	
 	
 		um by and large no but but they're big fun
 	
 	
 		yeah well i've been is that mostly uh fly fishing when you're doing that or are you fly fishing or are you using a bobber
 	
 	
 		what
 		i i i'm a fly fisherman
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah i i cast a ways i'm not highly proficient but it's fun
 	
 	
 		i've never even tried that my if i don't have a reel with a button on it i tend to get so much backlash it's not worth the trouble
 	
 	
 		well let me explain fly fly fishing to you then you're not casting a weight on the end of the line
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you're casting the weight of the line
 	
 	
 		with the little thing on the end yeah i thought it had a weight
 	
 	
 		yeah well the fly on the end weighs nothing it weighs less than the line
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so what you do is you strip off oh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four five six little</NUMEX> rolls
 		coils of line into your hand
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and you whip the line
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		as you whip it
 		over your head or side to side
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you slowly <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">feed</ENAMEX> out more and more
 	
 	
 		hum
 		so you're fishing downstream so it will carry some
 	
 	
 		well no no you fish upstream
 	
 	
 		oh you fish upstream
 	
 	
 		right and then you let it carry it downstream
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and then you reel it in and you do it again
 	
 	
 		you hope that they think it's a bug and
 	
 	
 		yeah exactly jump at it
 	
 	
 		and eat it yeah
 	
 	
 		uh
 		from what i'm seeing and hearing and all the the big pattern that's
 		really
 		looking forward for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">spring</TIMEX> is the grub pattern
 	
 	
 		that's a fish
 	
 	
 		no no it it looks like a grub yeah okay whenever you yeah a lure a fly
 	
 	
 		oh it's a it's a lure
 		i see
 	
 	
 		whenever
 		you have a something that looks like something else
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and it's a fly you call it a pattern
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		all right uh you know there's bumble bee patterns
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		there's excuse me uh there's bumble patterns there's mosquito patterns there's wasp patterns there's grub patterns uh
 	
 	
 		um
 		did someone just come up with this design and and you're going to make one for yourself or are you going to buy it
 	
 	
 		uh you can buy them uh i've got some and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		they seemed to have been hitting real heavy on it in Fall
 	
 	
 		oh it's just that that just happens to be what the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> like this year huh
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah you know how that changes
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		the phase of the moon and
 	
 	
 		i guess so we tend to use just bait and a few lures but bait tends to work the best just some blood bait
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i i
 		yeah i'm from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">west Texas</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh are you where are you from oh i'm from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Midland</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Lubbock</ENAMEX>
 		oh another <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">west Texan</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i went to college at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tech</ENAMEX> so you've been out to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buffalo Gap</ENAMEX> fishing
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah i've been up there
 	
 	
 		it
 	
 	
 		i didn't catch anything but i've been up there
 	
 	
 		it
 		it's kind of nice way to get away from everything for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the day</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah it's fun it's lazy take a picnic lunch i used to do that with my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> every once in a while we'd go out on a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> and just spend <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> before it got too hot
 	
 	
 		yeah it's
 		well
 		there you fish <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">mornings</TIMEX> and evenings
 	
 	
 		yeah  yeah we do most of our fishing at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">nights</TIMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		just from the heat of it all that's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> advantage you've certainly got on us
 	
 	
 		it at times gets incredibly hot here
 	
 	
 		it does i've only been up there once in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX> well no i've been up there twice in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX> but both times it was really pleasant in fact it snowed on us in in
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gosh</ENAMEX> when was that we were in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mesa Verde Park</ENAMEX> and it was like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of June</TIMEX> it was just before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July fourth</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June</TIMEX>
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and it was <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty eight twenty nine</TIMEX> degrees we were out in this silly tent with regular little sleeping bags not knowing any better  and here it went and it froze and it snowed on us
 		we did not know what to do about it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		fishing is not just just dragging <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> out of the water it's it's a total experience you know getting out in nature and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		hearing the crickets and listening to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> and seeing the squirrels and camping out and eating out of doors and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		do you
 		yeah
 		do you have to do you wear waders when you fish
 	
 	
 		uh i probably ought to i just freeze
 	
 	
 		oh goodness it must be a little bit cold
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah well you know ankle deep or standing on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX> and slipping it out there
 	
 	
 		that's cold <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> around there
 	
 	
 		slipping it out there
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		you know i always intend to just stand on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX> and just kind of slip it out there and
 	
 	
 		do you have any
 		oh i see
 	
 	
 		you know how it is the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>'s kind of
 	
 	
 		yeah and you get you get a little more carried away with it and you move a little closer
 	
 	
 		and then you're in to it just a little bit and then you splash in and the next thing you know your knees are wet
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		do you have any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> that you take fishing
 	
 	
 		uh
 		got a stepdaughter she's real sweet and uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		at times she enjoys it at times not and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		a fuzzy little dog
 	
 	
 		i have a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three and a half year old</TIMEX> and a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one and a half year old</TIMEX> and the little one of course is could care less the uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three and a half year old</TIMEX> has just gotten to the point we got him a little pole <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> and just put uh
 	
 	
 		ah
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		his big thing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> was throwing it in the water and reeling it up  that was what he considered fishing  <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> he's gotten to where he can we we were at a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX>'s uh stock pond we were out at their farm
 		and and they had been fishing and let him use the pole while we walked we all walked off a healthy <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">hundred yards</NUMEX> or so and let him <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> and he started trying to cast it
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		so he he was kind of getting there but he's
 	
 	
 		yeah you <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> sure want to be out of range
 	
 	
 		he's at a dangerous point right now he understands the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mechanics</ENAMEX> of pushing the button and throw but not necessarily the direction it's going to go in
 	
 	
 		it takes time yeah <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> we had a oh just a wonderful trip up to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Trappers Lake</ENAMEX> oh it was cold and rain the whole time and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		we still had a good time out of the deal
 	
 	
 		yeah well that's good
 	
 	
 		uh
 		and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colorado</ENAMEX> is a beautiful place to live
 	
 	
 		oh yeah my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> would like to live there but i don't know all of our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> is here so
 	
 	
 		well and you've got to have you've got to work for a living to
 	
 	
 		well yeah but <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> is up there so  that part of it would probably work out
 	
 	
 		what division y'all in
 	
 	
 		i'm sorry what
 	
 	
 		what <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX> are y'all in
 	
 	
 		we're both uh i was uh military but he's division three
 		it goes back and forth <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Division</ENAMEX> well maybe division <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> right now he's in computers
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so and he's in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> and everything else i have some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> who work up there
 	
 	
 		well the only thing up here is division one
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kathy</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kevin Guy</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		okay yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah and they like to fish they've been inviting us to come up there in the summer her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> has a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cabin</ENAMEX> and they go fishing up there
 	
 	
 		oh fishing's fishing is fun up here it's not
 	
 	
 		so that would be neat to try it some time
 	
 	
 		it seems like the success ratio the success rate here is not as good as on some of the better lakes there but
 		it is fun you know it
 	
 	
 		yeah long as you have a good time that's the main point so
 	
 	
 		the the experience is is better up here i think you know it seems more relaxing there's more to look at
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		definitely more to look at
 	
 	
 		and and there's something about listening to water run that's relaxing to the soul
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know if you're if you're just sitting on a nice hot lake
 	
 	
 		yeah the only thing you've got to watch is when that creek comes up we camped next to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one one</NUMEX> time when we were there <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of summers ago</TIMEX>
 		and we figured we were up a long way off and then it rained <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">that night</TIMEX> and we thought well wonder how far off we are and we got up <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next day</TIMEX> and that creek that had been fifty or <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">sixty feet</NUMEX> from our site of our tent was now about
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> feet away and it's like oh well maybe we ought to move just a touch so that was kind of funny
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah it it is interesting to watch that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> rise all of a sudden
 	
 	
 		yeah i just love the way it looks i could almost just watch the water we in fact we have gotten out on on trips before and just stopped and watched it because there was so much and if you were there i mean it was
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time we were there and i guess it was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late May</TIMEX> so it was really your <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">spring</TIMEX> almost you know at even though it was it was really summer down here and and the i guess the creek the mountains were really starting to melt and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">creek</ENAMEX> was just wild just running
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and and all the white <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> and noise and the it was just beautiful
 	
 	
 		yeah it it gets foamy foamy almost and you know it's just pure and pristine
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and the froth and
