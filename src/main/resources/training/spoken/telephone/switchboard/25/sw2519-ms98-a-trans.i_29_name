 		no i'm definitely  now i do like to walk
 	
 	
 		no me either
 		do you
 	
 	
 		yes since <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> has uh uh instituted that um
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> walkabout i have gone out and started walking even more bought me the you know the proper proper shoes and everything to get started and uh <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> out there you know way out there in the boondocks
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		wonderful
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and it was so funny <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the other day</TIMEX> i took some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> to to lunch
 		and when we came back they said oh there's a parking space real close and i parked way out in the boonies and i said you can walk off your lunch
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		that's the way to do it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i'm kind of like you i've never really gotten into it it's just a it's just a chore you know and i finally decided <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one semester</TIMEX> i'm in college and i'm taking night classes and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um um</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i still don't have any of my PE classes and so <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one semester</TIMEX> i thought okay that's what i'm going to do and that will get me where i'll have to do it you know
 	
 	
 		oh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and they were offering a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a</TIMEX> walking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> where you you know you have to walk you know that like for every mile you walk and every so many <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> you get you get points you know and then you have to go in once a week and log your points so it's not like you can do the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> like anytime you want you know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um um</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um um</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the semester</TIMEX> you go back in and your like your final exam is a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">three mile</NUMEX> walk and if you walk it in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this many minutes</TIMEX> you get an A <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this many minutes</TIMEX> you get a B
 	
 	
 		oh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i thought oh this will be an easy class and you know and i did it and i did it for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a long time</TIMEX> like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about the middle of the semester</TIMEX> i ended up having to have surgery on my foot and this has been <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of years ago</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well
 		oh no uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and you know i had i did that and i just ended up having to drop the class you know by the time the final came around i wasn't even where i could wear a shoe yet let alone walk <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> miles you know
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh no yeah
 	
 	
 		but that was the only time i have ever been able to like start an exercise program and really stick to it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um um</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		because then i had to i had to go <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every week</TIMEX> and log in what i had walked and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> looked at it <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every week</TIMEX> and it was you know
 	
 	
 		right
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but other than that i just you know i kind of get in the mood every once in awhile say okay i'm going to start going to aerobics now you know and and i'll go for like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks</TIMEX> and go this is for the
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		there you go
 		
 
 	
 	
 		birds you know this is too much work
 	
 	
 		well you know i have noticed too that uh uh when i started the exercise uh not the exercise but the walking program uh that i did tone up you know like all over but it didn't get the upper part of my body and uh so
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		what i do is i bowl i am a fanatic when it comes to bowling and i used to bowl <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> times a week so i really loved it and i still bowl at least once a week now on a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">league</ENAMEX> on on a and i'm bowling on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> league
 	
 	
 		wow
 		yeah
 		uh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um but i've noticed that what i do is that i have my towel that sits on the floor so that every time i get up to bowl i have to bend over to pick up my towel and that way i get the little extra exercise
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i'm always explaining to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> i do little things like that like you know take the stairs instead of the um the elevator and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i do silly things like that versus a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a regular</TIMEX> program that you would have
 	
 	
 		but that's you're amazed at how much that adds up i was on uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nutri Systems</ENAMEX> for a while and that is one of the things that they really stressed doing you know
 	
 	
 		it sure does
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		when you come to your Nutri System meeting don't <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> in the parking <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">place</ENAMEX> outside the front door <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> at the other end you know i mean and they stretched stressed things like that too you know during when you're sitting in sitting watching TV at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every</TIMEX> commercial get up off the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couch</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		there you go
 	
 	
 		go to the living room and get a glass of water go to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedroom</ENAMEX> and make the bed go do something
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but get up during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every</TIMEX> commercial and things like that and you'd be surprised at how much just that little bit adds up you know just gives you a little more activity so
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		that's true
 		that's true yeah
 	
 	
 		especially when you're like us and don't really want to do it anyway you know
 	
 	
 		hum-um no i used to i really did uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX> and uh i was thinking about that not too long ago that
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		i used to walk and not only did i walk but i used to watch all those exercise programs on TV and i would tape them
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and then i would do them like <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> times a day but i don't do any of that kind of stuff anymore i think having <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> everything just kind of everything goes by the wayside
 	
 	
 		well i can't use that as an excuse because i didn't do it before i had mine either so
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i've never been i just i'm more into you know sitting than i am
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah me too
 	
 	
 		so but you know i have found that with i have a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two year old</TIMEX> and i have found really though i'm kind of the opposite i'm more active now with him than i was before
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		because now you know he'll i want to go outside and i'll go outside with him and we'll walk up and down the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> and we'll go to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> and i'll run around with him and stuff like that that
 		so i'm getting more you know more exercise that way than i ever did before i had him you know so
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i think i think that has helped a little bit i don't know
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah running
 	
 	
 		just chasing him around the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> you know  will be plenty for you
 	
 	
 		oh yeah that's that's enough
 		
 
 		well <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mine</ENAMEX> are older now doing uh their own things so
 	
 	
 		right right you've kind of gotten out of that little stage there
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh yes yes i have a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirteen year old</TIMEX> and an <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eleven</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year old</TIMEX> so yeah yes
 	
 	
 		oh lucky you you're getting into even more interesting stages hm
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah see we're actually going through the same stages <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the two year old</TIMEX> and the teenager
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh yeah</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah  same thing huh it repeats repeats
 	
 	
 		yeah you watch it'll be exactly the same
 	
 	
 		the terrible twos repeat at about thirteen
 	
 	
 		
 
 		it does it does it it absolutely does so
 	
 	
 		how interesting i can hardly wait
 	
 	
 		yeah i i i know i just know you can't but no i don't get as much exercise as i used to but i at least since <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> has implemented that program i do i'm more aware of it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and you know that i'm need to do this that and the other and uh so i try to do combinations of things but not like go down to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Health Club</ENAMEX> like i see all these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> do
 	
 	
 		right that that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">walkabout</ENAMEX>'s a good program it really is you know when they first started it i i got all the information of course
 	
 	
 		it is it is
 	
 	
 		but just like everything else i was real <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">gung ho</ENAMEX> with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> of mine oh we're going to do this we're going to do this and we did do it for a long time
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and then i started school you know and like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two nights a week</TIMEX> i was going to school and then <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the other two nights a week</TIMEX> my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> worked so i had to pick <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ryan</ENAMEX> up you know there's always an excuse you know to to not do it so
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um um</ENAMEX>
 		oh yeah
 		oh yeah
 		and it gets worse it doesn't get any better
 	
 	
 		yeah oh and i'm sure i'm sure
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah because i'm constantly running my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> around someplace and that's where i actually get my exercise
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		is running them from here to there in the car
