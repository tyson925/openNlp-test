 
     		
 	
 		
  
 		well what's your favorite dish
 	
 	
 		oh for your question probably
 		it's uh tough to decide between like some sort of a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dish</ENAMEX> or something like pizza
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i understand that i like oriental cooking and uh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pasta</ENAMEX> and i have the same problem uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> heritage so i definitely like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pasta</ENAMEX> but i like <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> don't mix though  i've tried that that doesn't
 	
 	
 		
  
 		no
 		no although you can make a sort of a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> pizza
 	
 	
 		yeah that doesn't work very well either
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh i don't know sort of dumb what kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> would you have in a dinner party well it depends on what kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> you got coming over so we'll leave it at that
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		uh let me see what do you what you like to cook uh just everything or do you have specialties
 	
 	
 		i'm i pretty much specialize i guess in uh <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> um i'm a vegetarian
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		as uh <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> gives me a lot of room to play with i've been i've been doing some stuff with um <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Middle Eastern</ENAMEX> lately you know cooking up dals and stuff which has been fun
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah i um
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		i i've been collecting recipes and modifying recipes for a long long time
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh i run a little direct mail business on the side and i finally put together a cookbook
 	
 	
 		
  
 		wow
 	
 	
 		and uh i've got to
 		i got to reformat it i i did it on my word processor and now i've got to redo the whole thing again and i'm trying to figure out a cheap way to a quick way to do it without having to retype it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		because uh it's it's all size about it's not it's not very big i mean it's like <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred and five</NUMEX> pages something like that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but it's got lots of good recipes so i was thinking about trying to sell that on the side just  for fun
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah yeah i usually um you know i get <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Usenet</ENAMEX> so i usually just uh look at the recipe <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> in there uh for interesting things
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		well see what else can we talk about food
 	
 	
 		well what sort of cookbooks do you um do you usually use
 	
 	
 		well usually hardly any at all anymore um i've i've gotten together sort of like basic recipes
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and once you have those you can add to them or take away from them and come up with all kinds of different dishes
 	
 	
 		that's true
 		
  
 	
 	
 		i i have several cookbooks uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Betty Crocker</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> and a couple of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> cookbooks a couple of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> cookbooks i even got a <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Filipino</ENAMEX> cookbook um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		hm
 	
 	
 		they have a nice dish in there for a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chicken dish</ENAMEX> i forgot the name of it
 		but it takes a special kind of sausage and you can only get it at <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Filipino</ENAMEX> stores
 	
 	
 		well that's interesting
 	
 	
 		yeah and it's it's a it's a strange sort of it's sort of like a pepperoni
 	
 	
 		
  
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but it's it has a much sharper flavor and it's uh
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		it's almost like it has red dye in it or something when you cook it it bleeds and it colors the food
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		it's pretty interesting but it's a real good chicken dish it's sort of like a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chicken potpie</ENAMEX> in a way you have a crust on top and all that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		
  
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		delicious though i love it
 	
 	
 		do you
 		yeah i pretty much i i guess i stick pretty much i got a couple of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moosewood</ENAMEX> books some
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Greens</ENAMEX> i find to be very handy
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um
 		
  
 		other than that i mean i you know i got <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> others that i can i can look up for inspiration or something i don't know but uh yeah but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		an idea yeah
 		that's the way i am i generally get there and
 	
 	
 		
  
 		right
 	
 	
 		i have a have an idea of what i wanna do i don't really know how to get started so i i look at something get me get me ah yeah well i'll add this to it and do this and turns out pretty good sometimes
 	
 	
 		
  
 		right
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah i find it's usually pretty useful to cook you know some number of recipes out of a book to get a flavor of the style
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and then from that point you can pretty much improvise once you once you understand the spicing patterns and stuff like that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well i mean i mean that's yeah that's the fun of cooking improvising
 	
 	
 		right absolutely
 	
 	
 		if you're gonna sit there and just follow a recipe that's no fun
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know
 	
 	
 		i agree
 	
 	
 		you know a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkey</ENAMEX> can do that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i bet even my <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> could do that
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		no not this one she's dead to the world right now
 		oh well well let's see i guess that's about it on food
 	
 	
 		yeah okay
