 
     		
 	
 		well <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wayne</ENAMEX> i've never done any uh auto repairs myself at all i mean i may have screwed in a little  screw that looked like it was falling out on the door or something but uh i personally haven't done anything maybe
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i've uh changed wiper wiper blades or something but i have noticed since uh i got married that my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>
 		he hates to do auto repairs but he would rather do them himself than than to pay someone else i guess he can't make himself pay someone to do the repairs when he knows he knows how to do it
 		and to do it so he he hates the time that he takes but he has changed um
 		the brakes and he has done all of the tune-ups and the things like that  and recently he changed the steering mechanism in our car
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i was really impressed with that  we had to have it to get the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> inspected it wouldn't pass inspection and
 		and so he priced around and everyone wanted <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">several hundred dollars</NUMEX> for it so he thought well i can get one in a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">junkyard</ENAMEX>  for like fifty dollars which he did and then
 		he did it and i so i guess uh he's been pretty good about keeping our <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> up what uh what's your experience been like
 	
 	
 		well i uh i
 		have a long experience with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> i uh when i was younger uh my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> had a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Corvette</ENAMEX> and i bought a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corvette</ENAMEX>
 		when you have a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Corvette</ENAMEX> you more or less do all the work and i've done everything from build the motor from the uh you know the bare block on up
 		and i i'm the same way as your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> is when it comes to my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> i hate to go pay somebody good money
 		you know i hate to pay somebody <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty five dollars an hour</TIMEX> for something i can do myself it just to me it makes absolutely no economic sense to do that  in fact i um <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">just this past weekend</TIMEX> put new plugs in both uh my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> an my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>'s car
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		right
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and so i uh
 		i pretty much try to troubleshoot and do everything i can do myself but i've i've gotten to the point in my life um you know i just crept over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">forty years old</TIMEX> where
 		i don't want to crawl underneath the car anymore  i mean it's uh
 	
 	
 		that makes sense
 	
 	
 		i don't know whether i've i've just reached a point you know it's it's real rough in the winter time
 	
 	
 		huh yes
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		and so i try to make sure that uh by the time fall runs around because we actually have <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winters</TIMEX> here on the east coast um  that uh i have you know the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>'s in pretty good shape enough to last through the winter
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and uh then spring time i usually end up giving them uh a uh tune-up and make sure that they're running well and uh
 		yeah it's like i had the muffler go out on my on my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> shortly before it was required to go in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maryland</ENAMEX> they have uh emission tests
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and you're required to get your <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> to go through the emission test well my muffler of course starting going bad right before i was supposed to go to the emission test so you know i had to do that job and of course that was back in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December</TIMEX> when it's nice and cold outside
 	
 	
 		yes i'm sure it was
 	
 	
 		but the thing was that i could do the job myself i mean the parts cost me
 		oh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">roughly a hundred</NUMEX> dollars um if i'd taken it someplace to have it done it was going to be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three hundred</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		right
 	
 	
 		now like who's got that extra <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two and a quarter</NUMEX>  i know i don't so
 	
 	
 		yeah well that's exactly the way he feels is that
 		he really hates to spend the time it takes a lot of time if he if he thinks it's going to be <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two hours</TIMEX> it's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> if you know whatever it always takes him twice as long but then when he's finished he's he always says well now you owe me
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">hundred dollars</NUMEX>  and then he thinks that he has the money that that he can spend on something and he hasn't given it to someone else so he gets some satisfaction out of that although
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		generally i think he he does not look forward to or anticipate there's some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that enjoy tinkering around on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> there's a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and he just isn't one of them
 	
 	
 		yeah i uh i don't mind it um there was a time when i had my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Corvette</ENAMEX> i mean of course i loved it um
 		but i've you know i've got other interests now and there's a lot other more important things i think i should be doing with my time
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i have the same problem i mean you can tell him from me but it doesn't matter i mean i've i've had greasy fingernails for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>  and it still takes me twice as long as i think it's going to take to do the job
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so but think i think the difference is that uh when you own the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> you take more care in what you're doing
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and you want to make sure that it's done right and put back together right and
 		you know i've i've in the past i've had brake jobs done by someone that when i went back and
 		and looked at it <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">some months later</TIMEX> i'd find something drastically wrong with it
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know like a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">spring</TIMEX> that was put in incorrectly which could have resulted in brakes failing and me having an accident you know those kind of things and when you have a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicle</ENAMEX> that's being used by you know other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> you know you don't want
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		that kind of a situation to come up
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		and it's very very difficult to find a mechanic <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these days</TIMEX> that you can trust i only have one <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> that i know that i trust to work on my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> and uh he's <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about uh sixty miles</NUMEX> from here
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and so it and if i have something that's really major that i can't handle or feel i don't have the time to handle i'll take it to him to do it
 	
 	
 		right you know that it's uh really has a bad reputation is to feel that that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in general feel and have have rightly so i think been cheated many times and um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yes
 	
 	
 		and well i know once when we had a we usually round inspection time we find out there's something wrong with our <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> but um once the muffler needed to be changed and uh
 		he had looked at it himself and but we saw a commercial for like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fourteen or twenty</TIMEX> dollars or something for a change he said that's really really good so he went in and uh but when
 		they quoted him a price they really wanted fifty or something anyway but the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> that the muffler <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> had um my at least my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> felt that they had damaged the muffler
 		further you know they had punctured a big hole in it when it really could have just been patched or whatever and so since then i don't think he's ever even seriously considered a you know any kind of job he thought he could do himself
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but i know from his childhood he says his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> always buys and restores <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> just as entertainment i guess  and um so <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kelly</ENAMEX> growing up he
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		he felt like that that was a good way on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX>'s that he developed a good relationship with his father
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and so he used they used <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> repairs kind of as a way to have uh you know something that they did together
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and he thought that turned out pretty good because it you know it helped him to understand and be functional now and it helped him to have a close relationship so
 		that's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one one</NUMEX> way he looked at it
 	
 	
 		yeah that's probably uh
 		uh something that uh
 		is is you know is good for both of them i know that uh my older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> i could never get him interested in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> and i couldn't you know i just like you know you sure you're a boy i mean your not interested in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX>  i mean he he just
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		would not have anything to do with them and uh later on and uh like when he you know grew up got out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and got his own <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> um
 		he didn't know how to do anything to it i mean absolutely nothing i mean he couldn't even check the oil i mean that's that's how uninformed he was and disinterested
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i guess there are some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> out there like that um you know i always thought maybe you know if he took more of an interest and you know what i was doing and maybe we could have communicated better
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but uh yeah i i think that's great
 	
 	
 		yeah it didn't always work well i felt um i feel like i could myself do some things
 		but that i have enough responsibility  that if i have someone like my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> when i was living at home and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>
 		that's willing to do it i go ahead and let them do it i don't feel the need to um
 		you know be a feminist on that issue and say i can take care of my own things i'm i'm happy to let them run run the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> because i have so many other responsibilities that um
 		so i haven't tried to do a lot myself
 	
 	
 		uh i i trained my uh my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> in in doing things in fact uh when i uh <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> transferred down to uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texas Instruments</ENAMEX> back in nineteen <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eighty seven</NUMEX> um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh when i left here uh she had to change a set of plugs in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>  because she was up here for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a month or so</TIMEX> after i was
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh it was an interesting experience for her i mean she'd always assisted me and done some other things but for her to actually get in there and do it herself it was uh it was something a little different
 	
 	
 		hum
 		it's a good experience it helps you feel i think comfortable with your <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> and feel like it's
 		not so scary if um you're driving it and you might get stranded somewhere that you might you think well i've i've been under that hood and i know what's going on but
 	
 	
 		uh yeah
 		yeah i think it's important that everyone know you know basically how how the darn engine works it helps you figure out what's wrong with it you know i've i've been out with my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> before when
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know her <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> died on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">highway</ENAMEX> and i happened to be with her and managed to get her to the other side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> because it was dark and all
