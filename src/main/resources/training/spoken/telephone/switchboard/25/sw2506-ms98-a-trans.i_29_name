 		it's a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> story house it it's a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> home and it looks like it's going to be the last i think we're going to demolish it
 		we've got <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and it's
 		they have scraped the uh plaster off the walls you know with riding their little toys through it and stuff

 		and i wish we could down here
 	
 	
 		well it would be nice but i kind of like the freedom too don't you
 	
 	
 		well sometimes but i tell you i'd sure like to be able to get on a bus or something and get to work but if i did it it'd take me about <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an hour and fifteen minutes</TIMEX>
 		i would have to get on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> and drive or walk to a bus you know there's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> terminal close to us and then they'd drive me to the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terminal</ENAMEX> here then i'd have to go to downtown <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> and then walk over a couple of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">blocks</ENAMEX> and get on another <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bus</ENAMEX> to go to my school
 	
 	
 		right
 		if it's anything like uh
 	
 	
 		so that's too much
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> always has been no one wants to be at downtown <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> much
 	
 	
 		yeah but there sure are a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that work down there
 	
 	
 		is the crime rate still bad
 	
 	
 		definitely and i went down there a couple maybe <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three weeks ago</TIMEX> for a trial
 		
 
 		and i mean all these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> were standing up that was you know during the workday all along the curve <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> you know just
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		all around these vacant <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> there's a lot of vacant <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>
 		and they're just being demolished
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		and and they stink and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> bottles all over the place huh-uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		huh that's terrible
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Garland</ENAMEX> how nice is it now it's been a while since i've been there
 	
 	
 		you know i think it might be up to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two hundred and fifty thousand</NUMEX>
 		it's gotten big
 	
 	
 		yes it has
 	
 	
 		i think when we moved here it was like <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred and</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty</TIMEX> something like that
 		and i didn't realize when i moved here that it was a separate <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		well yeah it is
 	
 	
 		you know i know now
 	
 	
 		where you from
 	
 	
 		but i didn't i'm from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kilgore Texas</ENAMEX> it's in east
 	
 	
 		Kilgore i know where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kilgore</ENAMEX> is
 	
 	
 		oh where are you from
 	
 	
 		i'm i'm originally from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lubbock</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		are you
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so why'd you move up to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colorado</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		seemed like the thing to do at the time
 	
 	
 		well it's real pretty up there i have a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Denver</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh i love it the mountains
 		i love the mountains
 	
 	
 		what do you going
 	
 	
 		uh back to the topic
 	
 	
 		what
 	
 	
 		it seems that uh
 		more and more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are not owning owning traditional homes these days
 	
 	
 		they're not owning <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> period
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah uh everyone says
 		you know when i bought <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this several years ago</TIMEX> w hen our local economy was good everyone said no no you're crazy to buy a mobile home
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but now it seems that uh with the local economy bad and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> and straits it seems that uh
 	
 	
 		it wasn't such a bad idea
 	
 	
 		oh they're doing some backpedaling
 	
 	
 		so have you got uh land
 	
 	
 		no i'm renting at the time so
 	
 	
 		i did that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one year</TIMEX> i lived with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> and we all taught
 		it was a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedroom</ENAMEX> so we took turns
 		you know
 	
 	
 		turns
 	
 	
 		having sharing the bedroom
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i got to where i decided i wanted to pay more rent and get a private bedroom
 		and then we had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">baths</ENAMEX> it was just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> the little <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bathroom</ENAMEX> were the thing that really bothered me because i felt real closed in
 	
 	
 		well mobile <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> have changed a lot probably since you had one
 		ours is wood sided ours is wood sided
 	
 	
 		that was in the seventies
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and it has uh a traditional V top roof
 	
 	
 		i'm sorry
 	
 	
 		and uh it's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine hundred</NUMEX> and eighty square foot
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedroom</ENAMEX> one bath
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> are nice sized
 		well you can imagine <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine hundred</NUMEX> eighty square foot broke up into
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedrooms</ENAMEX> one bath it's it's comfy
 	
 	
 		
 
 		so have
 		have you got it underpinned
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		are you required to by law
 	
 	
 		i don't know whether it is or not
 	
 	
 		we were down here
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it was already setup when we bought it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 		well i bet it's not bad
 	
 	
 		oh yeah it's wood sided it has sheetrock everywhere and uh
 		you know so it's quieter than you remember mobile <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> to be
 	
 	
 		okay
 		but how much is yours when we bought ours we were paying <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three hundred and twenty nine</NUMEX> dollars
 	
 	
 		oh our payments are like two
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		for how many years
 	
 	
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fifteen</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh so it was still a lot cheaper
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		what
 	
 	
 		
 
 		so it was still a lot cheaper than what we did because ours is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty years</TIMEX>
 		
 
 		and we bought one of the cheapest houses you know a tract house
 	
 	
 		yeah oh yes a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mobile home</ENAMEX>'s a heck of a lot cheaper and
 		well actually whenever we got ours we picked it up used you know
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three or four years</TIMEX> used and uh
 	
 	
 		which probably didn't make much difference
 	
 	
 		well yeah did
 	
 	
 		have a  on it
 	
 	
 		no no no what i meant not in quality what i meant was
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four years</TIMEX> equity costs <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">five hundred dollars</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		in the price
 		gee nice huh   that sounds good
 	
 	
 		so you know there's not that much time left on the loan and
 	
 	
 		so if the economy gets better are you going to get another one
 		another house
 	
 	
 		i
 		don't know
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		uh to tell you the truth right now it feels kind of comfy to have our <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mobile home</ENAMEX> and have it so close to paid for
 		you know i need to pickup and move somewhere else
 		somewhere else is easy
 	
 	
 		but you wouldn't take that mobile home right
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		you would
 	
 	
 		sure absolutely
 	
 	
 		it'd be cheaper to move that than buy another one
 	
 	
 		oh absolutely
 		when i you know when you talk about the deal like i got yeah
 		yeah it would be cheaper
 		uh especially if it were a paid move or something
 		you know there's some paid moves occasionally
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> would pay move you
 	
 	
 		i don't know but
 		they did when i when i moved up here so they might want to move away
 	
 	
 		so how many <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> you been up there
 	
 	
 		uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six or seven</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		do you snow ski
 	
 	
 		uh a little bit little bit mostly i just love walking the mountains driving in the mountains
 	
 	
 		it's real pretty i went rock climbing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time
 	
 	
 		oh that's exciting
 	
 	
 		my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> talked me in that  i'm a real um scaredy when it comes to heights but once we got on top of the rocks it was quite
