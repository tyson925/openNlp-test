 
     		
 	
 		okay do you have any <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pets</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah i have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> and a dog
 	
 	
 		oh boy sounds like us yeah go ahead
 	
 	
 		um
 		uh we just got the the dog <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">less than a year ago</TIMEX> so he's still a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">puppy</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh what kind is it
 	
 	
 		he's a mixed breed he's part <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Collie part Shepherd</ENAMEX> and part Chow
 	
 	
 		oh so he's got
 	
 	
 		more <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Collie</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shepherd than Chow</ENAMEX> the only Chow he's got is is his tongue
 	
 	
 		oh he's got a blue tongue oh
 	
 	
 		yeah he's got little spots on them
 	
 	
 		we have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chows</ENAMEX> and  a miniature <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">Schnauzer</ENAMEX> and recently added a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guinea pig</ENAMEX>  which wasn't by my choice but
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i was out ruled so  but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> are mine mainly mine and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> but i just love them to death
 	
 	
 		was the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guinea pig</ENAMEX> for your for your child
 	
 	
 		daughter yes  yes as if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> weren't enough had to have  a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guinea pig</ENAMEX> so
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		anyway she's she enjoys her though so that's that's what matters but um our Chows we've had them
 		i'd say right around <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> maybe <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven years</TIMEX> and they're um
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		registered and we've been breeding them she's had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about four or five</NUMEX> litters
 	
 	
 		oh my my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>'s always wanted a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chow</ENAMEX> but i'm kind of concerned about um with having cats
 	
 	
 		oh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and how how they socialize with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> um which is one of the reasons why we got a mixed breed <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">um</ENAMEX> because we we thought they would socialize easier
 	
 	
 		right
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> had originally wanted an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Akita</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> has an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Akita</ENAMEX> and he so far he's bitten <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> people
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		um
 		oh man
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		goodness
 	
 	
 		and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that he got the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Akita</ENAMEX> from used to have <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> and they no longer have any other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so
 		uh
 	
 	
 		it's telling them yeah when we had um we had a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> when we first married no  yeah we had the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> and then we got um the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chows</ENAMEX> and  bring them bringing them in as <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">puppies</ENAMEX>
 		they got along just fabulous with her and uh you would think you know that they were all dogs the way she would prance around them and and paw at their face and they'd just play and they were never they never harmed her
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so uh they got along great now i don't know how
 		how it would be bringing in uh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">cat</ENAMEX> to a full full grown <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah i i wouldn't want to bring a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> into a full grown <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> but i i wouldn't feel
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um hesitant about bringing a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">puppy</ENAMEX> in to adult <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> i think they would socialize easier
 	
 	
 		right
 		i think so too
 	
 	
 		um
 		how how old is your child
 	
 	
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> she
 	
 	
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> so you had the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> before you had the baby
 	
 	
 		right and i was  not really concerned about
 		um them harming her uh i think i think a lot of that that that we hear all the time is how you bring them up
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and ours are real friendly they're protective but they're very friendly and lovable i mean you think they're lapdogs
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know they'll just come jump on your lap and want to be have their bellies rubbed and everything  and
 	
 	
 		what color are they
 	
 	
 		uh the female's red and the male is black
 	
 	
 		oh i bet the black one's pretty
 	
 	
 		yeah he is he's a big old thing and um i was concerned about the female mainly and as luck had it uh she had puppies <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the same week</TIMEX> my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> was born so it was kind of like she had her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">babies</ENAMEX> and understood about
 	
 	
 		about your baby
 	
 	
 		you know yeah and and i think that really helped and um my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> you know since since she's little has been playing with them and
 		they let her tug their hair and and get on their back or whatever and she's she's grown up with them and loves them to death and they love her so
 	
 	
 		yeah i think it's good for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> to grow up around <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pets</ENAMEX> as as long as they don't have any <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">allergies</ENAMEX> to them or anything but i think it really helps them to
 	
 	
 		so
 		i do too
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		understand when when uh they go to other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> and they have pets i see so many times <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> just
 		you know
 		being mean to <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> not really understanding that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> have feelings
 	
 	
 		yeah exactly that or or uh the other extreme they're they're terrified of them and i hate that and they shouldn't be i mean some maybe but but um
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		like our miniature <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schnauzer</ENAMEX> she's just she's just like um
 		a little hyper thing and just prances around and jumps all over everybody acting silly and a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> are scared of that
 		and which i understand because she is you know a lot of movement and everything but when she calms down they're so scared of her it's it that bothers me because she's the friendliest thing she wouldn't hit you know harm them at all
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		and and and that's mainly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that have never had <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pets</ENAMEX> around their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
 		so i think i think it's a good idea to have them
 		we've had a um
 		in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past</TIMEX> we've had birds too uh like cockatoos
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and parrots and uh
 	
 	
 		now are the are the cockatoos are those the big ones
 	
 	
 		the big white
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> with the the orange crest on top
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		we've had those and those are neat they're messy
 		very messy yeah and loud oh a lot louder than a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> you know a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> you can  stop barking you know or whatever but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> you it's hard to keep them from squawking or whatever but
 	
 	
 		are they
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but they were neat enjoyable <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> to have
 	
 	
 		well we've thought about getting an aquarium partly because partly for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> i think the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> would really enjoy it um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah with a lid
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah of course  um but so far we just uh and and starting up an aquarium an aquarium we we're thinking about getting a saltwater and they're so expensive to start up
 	
 	
 		oh yeah they
 		yes yes they are and in your  the luck of keeping them alive through those first you know few days
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		but the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">the</NUMEX> saltwater <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> have so much more color and they're so much more beautiful
 	
 	
 		i know they are
 	
 	
 		um the freshwater <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">tank</ENAMEX>'s just really to me they don't there's most of them really aren't that pretty
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		i really don't i really don't care much for them
 	
 	
 		right i don't blame you there i think the saltwater are a lot more attractive than
 		i don't know those <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish fish</ENAMEX> are just beautiful just it's like you have a little bit of
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ocean</ENAMEX> with you or something something rather than just little fish
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		but i don't mind having  my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> had a
 		like a little goldfish
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about a year or two ago</TIMEX> and it finally died and that was neat but it and they're you know she can't play with it you can just look at it and
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		you know you can't roll around and
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tussle</ENAMEX> around with it
 		like you can a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> or a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		yeah i wouldn't i wouldn't dare have a a goldfish here because uh it it it would probably be in a small bowl and then my <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> would knock it over i have to be real careful about
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		where i put things if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> will will jump up on things and knock things over all the time
 	
 	
 		oh no oh no
 	
 	
 		they're always up where they don't where they're not supposed to be
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yes yeah and that's hard
 	
 	
 		i know that's that's just like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> you know you you they know that they're not supposed to do it but they're going to do it anyway because they know they're not supposed to
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that's right and they're so independent i love having them for that reason
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah and until we got the dog um it was real easy to to go to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three day three day weekend</TIMEX> or whatever and now
 	
 	
 		sure
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it's like a major production trying to find somebody to take care of the dog while you're gone
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 		that's right that is hard
 	
 	
 		and i we knew it but we never even thought that about when we got the dog we just saw him oh he's so cute let's take him home  you know and then <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first weekend</TIMEX> we had him we had we were in a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> in a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedroom</ENAMEX> apartment
 	
 	
 		oh yes
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> went out of town
 		and left me with with the brand new <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">puppy</ENAMEX> and i had to work <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twelve hours</TIMEX> that day
 	
 	
 		oh fun
 		oh no
 	
 	
 		and so i left the dog locked in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedroom</ENAMEX> and i put paper all over the floor well when i came home i opened the door and there were chunks of carpet padding
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh oh no
 	
 	
 		everything all over the place and he had tried to dig his way out from underneath the door
 	
 	
 		oh no i guess you didn't get your deposit back did you
 	
 	
 		well i had the carpet fixed um i yeah i didn't even tell the apartment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> about it
 	
 	
 		oh good
 		oh okay  oh no bless your heart
 	
 	
 		but that that was my <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> real experience with with with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">puppy</ENAMEX> when when we had our family <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> growing up
 		i was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eleven</NUMEX> or twelve i think when we <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> got him and i wasn't really involved in the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the the</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		paper training and you know teaching him commands and stuff so this was and to me a whole new experience  only it wasn't like <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> at all
 	
 	
 		sure yeah
 		yes it is
 		no no i wish it was  i wish they were in that instinct
 		but they don't our only problem with our <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Schnauzer</ENAMEX> she's an indoor dog  most of the time  and
 	
 	
 		so
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh we finally she's right at a year and we finally got her you know house trained and everything uh her only problem is trash
 		if you do not pick the trash up you know the container and put it on a table or chair or something she'll knock it over i don't care how full full she is so it's not like she's hungry it's just she wants to get into trouble
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		my <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> do that it if i throw anything away that's any kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meat</ENAMEX> or anything like that anything that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		that they think is good they'll get into the trash and then it doesn't matter where you put it and where you hide it and how how tight you have the lid down on it they'll get into it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i've come home <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many a days</TIMEX> from work to find trash all over the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen</ENAMEX> floor
 	
 	
 		oh i hate that
 	
 	
 		and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>'s just looking at me like sorry
 	
 	
 		uh yeah  you shouldn't have left it there  i just hate that when she does that i just oh and she knows it's wrong you'll walk in the door and she'll cower and go hide under the table
 	
 	
 		i couldn't help myself
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so you she knows she does wrong
 		but she uh she continues continues to do it so
 	
 	
 		yeah and the problem that we're having with our puppy right now he's not really he's actually not really a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">puppy</ENAMEX> anymore he's like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixteen months</TIMEX> old
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um
 		but he's still chewing
 	
 	
 		oh is he
 	
 	
 		um the last thing he chewed up was
 		uh when we
