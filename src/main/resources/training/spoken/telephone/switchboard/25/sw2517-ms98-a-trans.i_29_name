 		make taken all the chicken breasts off the bones and i had this whole stack of nice chicken breasts up there and he jumped from the floor probably <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about four and a half feet</NUMEX> high and grabbed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of them off and devoured it before i could get near him
 	
 	
 		yeah that sounds that sounds like <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Kitty Cat</ENAMEX> our our <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bombay</ENAMEX> she's very athletic um being
 		tall and skinny she can do all kinds of she's very versatile with her paws she's almost like a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkey</ENAMEX> she even eats with her paws
 	
 	
 		really wow
 	
 	
 		yeah she'll she'll dip her <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> or her paw down into the food and scoop up some and eat it from her paw
 	
 	
 		have you ever taken videos of her or something that must be fun
 	
 	
 		no we're going to uh we're going to catch her doing some some of the funnier things and she's also a retriever
 		the only thing she likes to play with is crumpled cigarette packs so i crumble up a cigarette <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pack</ENAMEX> and i throw it and she'll go get it and bring it back to me it's just like having a dog
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		she loves to play fetch and it doesn't matter where i throw it she can get it i've i've thrown it under under the refrigerator and she'll get down there and stick that long skinny paw in there she's very versatile
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		maybe she likes the smell of it
 	
 	
 		i don't know i i think she just likes the noise because if i want if i want to find her anywhere in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX> all i have to do is crumble a package and she will come running
 	
 	
 		that's amazing that's really cute
 	
 	
 		yeah she yeah she's she's a sort of a weird one
 		why don't you go back to sleep  uh she's up playing now
 	
 	
 		now she can maybe she'll type something that you need for you and then you'll be in good shape like a paper
 	
 	
 		no now she's now she's just she's just rearranging all my papers for me she's playing with the pen uh-huh  why don't you play with the keyboard
 	
 	
 		oh
 		when i had the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">uh cats</ENAMEX> at my place as soon as i took out the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX> to read it they would plop right down on top of it and just not move and just stay there forever
 	
 	
 		uh-huh oh yeah well <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sheba Sheba</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">himmy</ENAMEX> loves to play with the paper she uh she gets she likes to crawl inside of it
 		and she thinks she's hiding and nobody can see her
 		and uh she'll jump all over it and tear it to shreds
 		she's something she she's a stubby little thing she's big for her age
 		she got little short legs and great big paws  and she's not she's not athletic like <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Kitty Cat</ENAMEX> i mean the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of them these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> are the favorite playmates
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Van</ENAMEX> sort of sits off by itself but they love to play and uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sheba</ENAMEX> has the weight advantage because she's heavier
 	
 	
 		she would just sit on the other one
 	
 	
 		oh when i <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> got her i mean <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sheba</ENAMEX> was just a little tiny thing got her at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten weeks</TIMEX>
 		and and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Kitty Cat</ENAMEX> took it upon herself to train her and she and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Kitty Cat</ENAMEX> would jump all over her and beat her up and all you'll hear is Sheba you know  all the time
 		well now she's bigger than <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Kitty Cat</ENAMEX> and she's giving <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Kitty Cat</ENAMEX> some payback
 	
 	
 		she be she gets back at <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">kitty cat</ENAMEX> for all the hassle
 	
 	
 		that's right <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Kitty Cat</ENAMEX> they'll be playing and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Kitty Cat</ENAMEX> will jump on her and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sheba</ENAMEX> will just turn around and throw her to the floor get on top of her and  you can't do that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</TIMEX> she'll have stitches leave her alone
 	
 	
 		oh
 		have you always had <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> did yo u have them when you were a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah ever since i was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> was asthmatic and so we never had <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pets</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> we had a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> for a little bit of the time and then but that time i never really liked <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> you know i always thought <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> were loose and sort of the typical
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 	
 	
 		thing you say about <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> you know they don't they don't they're not people <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> and things like that and i favored <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> a lot but <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> are just too impractical to have at all
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah well especially where you are
 	
 	
 		oh yeah it's impossible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have them and they're out walking them on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> but i don't think it's fair to the animals
 	
 	
 		
 
 		no not not for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> especially some of the breeds they've got and some of those you know need to be outside and have places where they can run and all that that's why i like <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> so much better they're easy to take care of
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		do you let your <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> outside
 	
 	
 		no no not these these are these are all purebred
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		are you afraid they'd get stolen or run away or
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		uh stolen run away no i doubt it but i don't want them breeding with any
 	
 	
 		well that's for sure but
 	
 	
 		yeah with any any weird <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">strange cat</ENAMEX> around here
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		we're going to be looking for a stud for this one pretty soon
 	
 	
 		how old is she again
 	
 	
 		she's uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four months</TIMEX> right now
 	
 	
 		you breed them that young i mean like in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> or
 	
 	
 		well no well no we have but you have to line up a stud <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several months</TIMEX> in advance she'll be going into heat probably around uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July</TIMEX> or August
 	
 	
 		i see
 		but you breed them the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time they go into heat
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		yeah you get your best litter is usually your <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> one
 	
 	
 		really wow that's amazing because i would have thought that it would be better to wait a little bit
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nah</ENAMEX> so it's sort of an old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> or common folk tales about you know if you're going to have a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> spayed let it go through heat first not true because when they go into heat their uh
 		genetic parts swell up and expand and everything and then once you do take them into surgery it's a little more difficult easier to have them spayed before they even go into heat
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but but when they first go into heat uh that's the time when you want to breed them especially the purebreds
 		we'll find you a nice handsome stud
 	
 	
 		are you going to try and breed her several times or you'll see how the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> breeding goes or
 	
 	
 		uh probably just twice
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		just twice for her and we're going to end up probably keeping one out of each litter
 	
 	
 		how expensive are you know thoroughbred <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> to get
 	
 	
 		um not too awfully uh uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sheba Sheba</ENAMEX> cost us uh <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">two hundred dollars</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		you
 		that's not that bad but you certainly want to protect them after that
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i mean the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the stud</TIMEX> fee is worse i mean we're going to be paying probably <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">four hundred dollars</NUMEX> for a stud
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">wow</ENAMEX> and how much can you sell the litter for you know the same type of price if they're good or
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		uh we're going to breed her with a champion so we'll be able to get uh probably around <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> fifty for the kittens
 	
 	
 		um-hum and how much uh how many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kittens</ENAMEX> do they normally have in the litter
 	
 	
 		her <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> one will probably be <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about four</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
