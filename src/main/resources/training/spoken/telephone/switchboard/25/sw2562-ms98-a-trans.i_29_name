 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so
 		if i do any garden work it's only when i go home in the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Summer</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh where do you go to college
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		where's that
 	
 	
 		it's <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about two hours</TIMEX> north of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yes well do you do you know do you do gardening at home
 	
 	
 		yeah we go home well we have a large <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> there's twelve <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> in my family
 	
 	
 		oh my goodness
 	
 	
 		so like almost all our <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetables</ENAMEX> and everything is from the garden
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		so we have a pretty good size garden
 	
 	
 		yeah well i guess you glad you got to go to college so you'd get some rest
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but we have like a lot like my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mom</ENAMEX> likes <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> so we have a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> too
 	
 	
 		yeah i had a whole bunch of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> and things well i don't have as many now we lived in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a long time</TIMEX> and i had a whole bunch but
 	
 	
 		so
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		now i work and i live in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> so
 		that sort a kind of hung it up i have a few <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> but most of mine are like in <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">barrels</NUMEX> and things like that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> i decided that well my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> made a little garden
 		out there with some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tomatoes</ENAMEX> and stuff in it but i decided that i don't like grass i don't like to have to have to pull grass
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so i decided that i would plant me a tomato <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> in a flower pot
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		to go see how it worked
 		and mine looks real good
 	
 	
 		you you know i've seen a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that do that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i've seen you know like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elderly people</ENAMEX> that really can't get out too much and sometimes like we i have a great <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aunt</ENAMEX> that lives in a
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it's it's just like uh a high rise for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elderly people</ENAMEX> and you know she does her own thing and everything but she has it's like a little apartment <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> and she has a tomato <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> round
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh
 	
 	
 		because she you know they keep it warm with for all the older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and she keeps it <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> round
 	
 	
 		i had never thought about that i could probably plant <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> and bring it in and just like i bring my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every year</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		that'd be neat well i got a patio and
 		i tried to talk my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> into just buying a whole bunch of pots  and planting them all in it you know because that's favorite thing is <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tomatoes</ENAMEX> to grow
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and so um but he said no he was going to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> in the earth you know like he always has because he's always had a garden out in the country
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i think he kind of misses it a little bit you know since we moved to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> but um
 		i went ahead and planted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mine</ENAMEX> looks better than his
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it does and then i like um you know what daylilies are
 	
 	
 		pardon me
 	
 	
 		daylilies
 	
 	
 		are are they well do they just come out in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX> then go so but we call them morning glories up here
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh</ENAMEX> that bite you
 		no no hum-um these look like a <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">lily</ENAMEX> they look like a a well they really look like an orchid
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		when they come out uh-huh that what the look like but they only bloom for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		they'll um you'll have a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">bud the evening</TIMEX> before and then <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the next morning</TIMEX> as soon as the sun hits it it opens it starts opening up and then when it gets dark it closes and that's it it only blooms for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		and then it's done completely done
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		yeah but um
 		they look like <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">orchids</ENAMEX> is what they look like but they look like different color ones like i have uh yellow ones and i have red ones and i have purple ones and then they have like you know the velvety real velvety looking stuff inside
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		it looks just like <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">orchids</ENAMEX> in different colors that's what they look like
 	
 	
 		oh that'd really pretty
 	
 	
 		they are they're beautiful uh i have a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> when i lived out in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> and she had belonged to this kind of society that like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every year</TIMEX> you know or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every so many months</TIMEX> they would send you different bulbs that they came out with
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i mean they were real expensive they were like well the most expensive one that she gave me a bulb for was like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty two fifty</TIMEX> for one bulb
 	
 	
 		oh my gosh
 	
 	
 		so what she would do is she would plant them and they multiplied
 		so <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next year</TIMEX> when she you know weeded them out so they wouldn't be as thick then she'd give me some of the bulbs
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i mean i have some of the most beautiful day lilies that you've ever seen
 		so when we decided to move it was really funny because like i said i had a whole bunch of
 		different kinds of things and i kept saying well i want to take a few of these and i want to take these and i want to take these
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> finally said look are we going to take the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">grass</ENAMEX>  can we leave the grass  i said yes we may leave that and we had a tree
 	
 	
 		
 
 		take the whole grass the whole yard
 	
 	
 		yeah and we had a tree that was um like <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">seventeen foot</NUMEX> tall or something like that and he said
 		no no i am not taking the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> you know i mean every time we went outside he'd look at something that was humongous you know no we're not taking that
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		but the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last day</TIMEX> he said can't we leave the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">grass</ENAMEX> and i said yeah i think we will leave that
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but um i brought um my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> when they were little they had given me uh some azaleas so i brought all my azalea <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">bushes</ENAMEX>  and you know i brought i brought as much as i could bring
 	
 	
 		that'd be funny
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		without you know really tearing up their place but just like um you know the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that bought ours
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		they bought the place but um i knew that they would you know if i left like one bulb of each <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of them by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> they'd have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> bulbs of each <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of them
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so it wasn't like it was going to be this big raw place or something you know it would cover it right up
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but i just couldn't see it you know going off and leaving everything like that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		because this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> i really liked it and everything but the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">yard</ENAMEX> was a lot to be desired oh there was nothing these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> we have one ugly pine tree
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i mean and it is ugly
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i even tried making it look nicer you know i tied the yellow ribbon around it and it was so ugly oh it did not help let me tell you i took it off and put it on my door i did not want to call attention
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah i mean it was terrible so really the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> that i brought over and put out here the are just about all i don't do any of the mowing or you know edging and all that my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> does all that stuff
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but that's because i'm allergic to the grass
 	
 	
 		oh that'd be awful i love going out in the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Summer</ENAMEX> in the grass
 	
 	
 		really now i like to go to the beach where the sand is because then it doesn't make me ill
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah but um well even up here at school you know you it gets hot and we have the windows open well they mow the grass up here sometimes <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">six o'clock in the morning</TIMEX> and just to smell the grass it's just i just love the smell of freshly cut grass
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah i used to until it i got so allergic to it i don't know if it's all well i went and had some tests run and just about all the kinds i was allergic to but it's not as bad here
 		um like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint Augustine i</ENAMEX> think is what we have and it's not as bad as it was when we were out in the country
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but out in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> i mean if i went outside while he was mowing the grass i was going to have a gigantic attack
 	
 	
 		oh my gosh
 	
 	
 		so um i get shots for it now too that helps a whole bunch but one good thing about it see i don't have to mow the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">grass</ENAMEX> or  i mean that's really nice
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but
 	
 	
 		well you said that you had a garden what what all things do you <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> in it or do you like to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> in it
 	
 	
 		um well the first thing we always <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> is tomatoes i mean <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every year</TIMEX> i don't care if we don't have anything else we're going to have <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tomatoes</ENAMEX> and then we plant cucumbers and uh we
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		do your cucumbers come good
 	
 	
 		oh yeah uh
 	
 	
 		really sometimes when my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> has like that's the one thing no one is allowed to touch except my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> he takes care of all the cucumbers
 		because he said the vines are just so at our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> as soon as you touch a <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">vine</ENAMEX> it's like it completely dies
 	
 	
 		really it must be the um at
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		sometimes we have really good luck with them but then there'll be like maybe <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</TIMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a row</TIMEX> that we can't get anything
 	
 	
 		now that's i mean that's something that grows like a <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">weed</ENAMEX> here
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		i mean it grows like a weed we have to allow extra room for those because you know i mean extra space between the rows and all
 	
 	
 		yeah because they take up a lot
 	
 	
 		yes but i mean we usually get if we <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> for every <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> we probably get fifty to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixty</TIMEX> cucumbers off of it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		holy smoke
 	
 	
 		i mean just pulling them as fast as you can we usually give them to everybody anybody that wants a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cucumber</ENAMEX> can have it but we tried it too where you run it up a fence
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and um yeah we had some weird <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cucumbers</ENAMEX> because they grew inside the fence i mean like the little thing would be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> side and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> on the other
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh my gosh
 	
 	
 		i mean it was but we they're so heavy you know they get so heavy they kind of weigh it down but
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i mean cucumbers here grow like crazy
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	

 		of course it's real hot here too you know
 	
 	
 		well see <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tomatoes</ENAMEX> grow like crazy at our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> Like we have a section of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tomatoes</ENAMEX> and we put the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tomatoes</ENAMEX> there <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every year</TIMEX> in the same section And i swear we get <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tomatoes</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> rows up
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah yeah now if we have any like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> will pick or something you know and some of the seeds drop have you ever had them just come up in different places from that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i know we do that too you know and at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first year</TIMEX> because i was from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> when we got married and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first year</TIMEX> that we planted i couldn't figure out i mean the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">well</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first year</TIMEX> after
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i mean we planted them but <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first year</TIMEX> you know after we'd had a crop
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		all these little things like we had cucumbers coming up you know in the middle of our okra and i thought how did this get here i know i didn't put that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seed</ENAMEX> there and it was weird but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> had you know evidently just
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		deposited them for us
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well sometimes too when we take out our garbage and we usually you know we just dump it in the middle of the garden you know after your garden's basically done
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and we're now finding out like we have peach <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> in the middle of our garden now because we took <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peach seeds</ENAMEX> and dump them there whenever the garden like in the fall
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		now we have peach <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> coming up
