 		well you know what they say about the weather here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		what's that
 	
 	
 		if you if you don't like it wait <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five minutes</TIMEX> it'll change

 		and i grew up in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint Louis and Saint Louis</ENAMEX> was much the same
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well tell me uh is is it normally that cold up there in the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">in the Spring</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		no it's not this is uh about uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> degrees cooler than usual but <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about a week ago</TIMEX> we were up to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">eighty and eighty five degrees</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		you're kidding
 	
 	
 		no no it uh it fluctuates from one extreme to the other it seems
 	
 	
 		you are you sure you didn't leave your refrigerator door open
 	
 	
 		i'm sure i didn't i was ready to turn on the air conditioning
 		it no it really was extremely warm it only got down to about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixty</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five in the evening</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		we had <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about three or four days</TIMEX> of that and then all of a sudden a cold front came down and uh temperatures dropped <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> degrees in a very short length of time
 		and uh it has gone down gradually <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each day</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this morning</TIMEX> it was <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty nine</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> it was about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty two</TIMEX> uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> were scraping <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> off their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this morning</TIMEX> if they've been sitting out <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">all night</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it really wasn't too wasn't too pleasant
 	
 	
 		oh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> macree
 		no i should say not
 		well i i sincerely hope that you don't have that terrible storm we had
 	
 	
 		oh i hope not
 	
 	
 		i hope it doesn't reach you up there
 	
 	
 		well they are predicting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rain</ENAMEX> and thunderstorms and i wouldn't be a bit surprised by what we would not be getting the same weather you had
 	
 	
 		well i let's hope it well it if it's the same as what we had at least it'll be warmer
 	
 	
 		uh yeah  yes warm rain well of course by the time it gets up here it may run run into a cold front coming down from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah oh boy the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the that whew</TIMEX> that would be tear disastrous if you had that rain storm and freezing weather
 	
 	
 		yes
 		yes
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		we had uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a week ago</TIMEX> they had golf ball size hail coming down in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> part of the uh of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Dayton</ENAMEX> itself
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh then we just had <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about an inch and a half or two inches</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rain</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">less than an hour</TIMEX>
 		it was just coming down by the bucketfulls and a great deal of lightning
 		it it wasn't uh it wasn't conditions to being out in it and i had just gotten home we had a lot of tornado warnings also
 	
 	
 		oh yes
 	
 	
 		and i had gotten home shortly before that uh the rain started so uh i felt a little more secure that i was at home rather than having to be out driving in it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well uh i heard on the news <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this morning</TIMEX> that um
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of our local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> uh lost the roof of their gymnasium
 	
 	
 		is that right
 	
 	
 		and they suspected may have been a tornado
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but uh uh thank God for small favors the uh
 		uh what do they call them the the
 		marching <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> or something
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh uh had just quit rehearsal <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about a half hour</TIMEX> before
 	
 	
 		oh they that was
 		very very fortunate for them
 		because that could have really been disastrous
 	
 	
 		oh and how
 	
 	
 		well of course this is tornado season uh in to uh we have many tornadoes spawned in this area and northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indiana</ENAMEX> now we're in the southwestern part of uh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		just <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">forty miles</NUMEX> north due north of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cincinnati</ENAMEX> and uh but uh northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indiana</ENAMEX> has many tornadoes come roaring across and we get the backlash off of it if not the part of the tornado itself
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so uh we you know we get a lot of bad weather in this area
 		but of course you're supposed to be the sun belt and i do know that you get some freezing weather down there on occasion
 	
 	
 		oh yeah well during the winter yes we do uh we've had uh
 		well <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">past four or five years</TIMEX> i guess <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least one day</TIMEX>
 		during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> when just everything would just close down because we'd have freezing rain
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh of course <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> down here they just don't know how to handle themselves and
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right yes i was going to say that it does make a difference when you're not accustomed
 	
 	
 		oh not only that but we're we're either either don't have the equipment to handle it either
 	
 	
 		to uh having to drive in it
 		right right
 		and
 	
 	
 		uh they go out there and the well all you can do with with uh freezing rain of course is spread sand on the ice
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and but uh you know we don't even have <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicles</ENAMEX> that will do that they they have to get uh a truck of sand and uh uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four or five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">laborers</ENAMEX> up there just spreading it by hand
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		right well uh well here what they do and i i contend that it's certainly not the right thing to do they spread salt
 		and of course the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX> does melt the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> but then what melts immediately freezes and becomes uh a perpetual problem
 	
 	
 		well and then to make matters worse it destroys your <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicles</ENAMEX> too
 	
 	
 		oh it sure does do that
 	
 	
 		yeah they well we they do that down here too they mix the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX> in with the sand
 	
 	
 		well sand and uh but i have learned to do is uh now that i am alone is uh to carry bags of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX> in the trunk of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> um
 		not only in case i need it for that for traction but for additional weight in the back of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> and then of course kitty litter is also excellent for that
 	
 	
 		yes uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i don't know whether you've ever thought in terms of that but
 	
 	
 		i've no i'm a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lover</ENAMEX> myself
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> don't use litter but kitty litter is excellent for uh getting under the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">wheels</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> and what have you and giving you traction uh-huh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah i guess it would be
 	
 	
 		yeah it uh works out uh really quite well course i have i have a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> also my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> brought me a little <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Lhasa Apso uh</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">my birthday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last Thanksgiving</TIMEX> he brought him from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> he
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh wasn't that nice of him
 	
 	
 		yes that uh he just thought i had been without a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog uh</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three years</TIMEX> that was long enough
 	
 	
 		uh i have uh a a chowperd myself
 	
 	
 		he he had
 		oh a what
 	
 	
 		a chowperd
 	
 	
 		now that one i'm not familiar with
 	
 	
 		well she's part <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chow</ENAMEX> and part shepherd
 	
 	
 		uh okay okay that makes sense then  i believe
 	
 	
 		uh-huh but she's the best
 		the best of both breeds
 	
 	
 		yes right well i've always had big <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> before never had a little <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> before and
 	
 	
 		well <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June</TIMEX> is medium sized but she is scared to death of thunder storms
 	
 	
 		yes well
 		oh well i had a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> short hair that was frightened of storms the minute it would begin to storm he would just panic
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh i had to put him down when he was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fourteen</NUMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two months later</TIMEX> i had to put my yellow Lab down because he had leukemia
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and uh  then uh then there was no point in having all my acreage i had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a half acres</NUMEX> with game preserve on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> sides
 	
 	
 		oh that must be nice

 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh so this little <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> has plenty of room to run
 	
 	
 		well good
 	
 	
 		yeah and he is a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a cutie</NUMEX> and uh but i've never had a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> i had to keep taking to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groomer</ENAMEX>'s to have groomed either and it's
 	
 	
 		no well now you know it sounds like you ought to be in a condo down in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Miami Beach</ENAMEX> somewhere
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		or better yet down around <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saint Petersburg Florida</ENAMEX>

 		and uh
 		course there too you never know what the weather's going to be when you start getting over to
