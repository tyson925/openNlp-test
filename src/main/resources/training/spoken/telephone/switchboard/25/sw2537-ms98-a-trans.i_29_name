 
     		
 	
 		
 
 		okay well uh how do you feel about uh drug testing
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">um</ENAMEX> personally i don't have a problem with it uh i think uh
 		as far as uh protecting fellow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> protecting their reputation of the company
 		and the quality of work that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> do um it's justified on the other hand um i do agree that it's it's a it's an invasion of privacy as far as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>'s
 		involvement outside of work um i would never i would never have a problem with anyone testing me but i can understand why <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> would object so i guess uh i guess uh i'm kind of mixed on it still at this point
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i am too a little bit i mean i i don't
 		want to be around <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who are really on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> and that sort of thing and and you know obviously they're probably not going to be doing a good job and so forth but i don't really like having to do it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		it and i don't like the idea of it it's it's makes too much of a big <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> type of thing
 	
 	
 		that's absolutely right it it uh i guess it all comes down to uh you know a a definition of uh how much out outside activities affect your work and uh
 		uh granted you know any any kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> use on on company property and whatnot is is definitely not acceptable uh uh i don't think anybody would ever argue that or uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">hum-um</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		any any after affects carrying over into the workday but um
 		you know i i don't i'm not particularly concerned with what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> do um after they leave for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> especially if i don't if i don't uh see any results of it <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next day</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i think so too but you know it's one of those things
 	
 	
 		well it it is it you know on the other hand you you've got uh you've got the uh the possibility of people
 		oh you've got some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> could be arrested for uh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> use <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> dealings and things like that and uh if their if their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employers</ENAMEX>
 		name hits the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX> and that it's it's it's a mark against them the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> and uh you know what kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> work there what uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		plus i guess if they are in trouble enough to be jailed or something of that nature for any length of time then the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> has lost what they've put into that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX> and their expertise or whatever
 	
 	
 		that's right that's right
 		right even even if it is you know a company policy of uh
 		immediate termination or whatever they still have to replace them
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh there's there's a lot involved there
 	
 	
 		well do you think that um it should be like we have this sort of random spot testing type of thing or
 		do you think it would be more palatable if we had some sort of regular schedule or would that just allow everybody a chance to get out of it
 	
 	
 		i think i think the regular schedule stuff
 		um that when you say everybody get out of it that's a good point i never really thought of it that way
 	
 	
 		well you know if if they have time enough they can
 	
 	
 		yeah they really can um i think the big the biggest problem i've got is is forcing it on someone after they've already
 	
 	
 		stay off of it
 	
 	
 		agreed to the terms of employment um as far as the new hires i i hired on just early enough that i i missed it um where the new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hires</ENAMEX> were concerned but uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		not nobody no i don't think anybody questions that um testing someone as a as a as a pre condition to being hired but um for the conditions of employment to change while you're on the job that's
 		i i don't know that that's where i think that most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> get upset it's uh yeah it it's changing the rules in the middle of the game basically and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's just it it's a really tough question and it you know it <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have have really quieted down after everything started but i still think there's a lot of there's a lot of resentment
 	
 	
 		i think so too uh i know the the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> i was in at the time this all came up they uh were quite vocal about it uh through electronic mail <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> they just really
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know  let them have it from one end to the other vehemently but uh it has quieted down but i don't think they probably feel any differently and some some of them did quit the company
 	
 	
 		you bet
 		no that's right
 		yeah i i know of some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who did uh it was it was indirectly related you know they could always come up with other reasons but it it had a lot to do with it just uh the the whole attitude because it's really uh
 		it's just really it it seems so unTI you know with the the whole relaxed atmosphere that we have um to all of a sudden
 	
 	
 		true
 	
 	
 		uh start forcing attitudes and whatnot you know there's not a lot of pressure to to vote the right way or anything else around <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> like there like there is in some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> or at least you know from what i've heard but uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah i wouldn't like anything of that nature you know don't tell me what to do you know
 	
 	
 		yeah  um-hum no absolutely absolutely not you know it's it's it's if
 		you know if you hired me i'll be you know supposedly you agreed with a majority of my views and my qualifications to begin with so uh you know let's let's stick with that original trust i guess huh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh it's it's still it it still remains a tough question and it's there's a lot of you know the whole the whole <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> of defense uh
 		reasoning behind the original plan and whatnot there's a lot of different things that uh come into play but that was i think everybody everybody pretty much knows that that was kind of a smoke screen to implement it throughout the whole company
 	
 	
 		yeah well i guess too if i thought that this would help really and truly do away with the drug problem
 		then that would be one thing but i think it's too minor and too
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know in in the whole scope of things this isn't going to to have any real affect on what's going on on the street
 	
 	
 		i really don't think so yeah i really don't because some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are going to are are going to risk it um it may prevent
 		i i guess i guess what i'm trying to get at is if it if it if it does help
 		a few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> maybe maybe it's worth it um you know it may prevent somebody who was was teetering on the edge of experimenting or whatnot but uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i don't know if you know the it's it's a needs of the few and the needs of the many type situation i don't know if everybody should have to sacrifice quite as much
 		there there's still a big question in my mind that the the absolute
 		refusal to accept the possibility of of mistakes on the testing is something that still bothers me it it's
 	
 	
 		well yes that yes i i think that could be a big problem you know i would just be irate if they said it was positive and i knew it wasn't you know that just really rub me the wrong way
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		um-hum absolutely and that i i don't know if uh i don't know if everybody understands all the implications on that too even even if you
 		you know if you take uh a a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> that was prescribed prescribed for you but the the prescription has run out you still had some left and you happen to take an extra
 		penicillin <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">well penicillin</ENAMEX>'s not on the list but you know yeah i i think you understand what i'm getting at it it can still show up and it can still flag as a positive and and those kinds of things obviously that's not the intent
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		right
 		no
 	
 	
 		and uh those are the kinds of things that still can show up
 	
 	
 		i guess the one that really got me too was that uh let's say your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spouse</ENAMEX> is on a particular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> and you know what that is and then you end up with the same problem and you take their leftover <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX> that's not allowed
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		you know that's that's totally out
 	
 	
 		that's right i even had <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> when i was going to college who were in uh
 		who are in pharmacy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> and they could legally um provide <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX> to their family mens family family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> certain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicines</ENAMEX> were were legal now i i i believe
 		you know any of the any of the ones we would we would be tested for wouldn't be on those lists but uh um there were certain things that they could provide without a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> prescription based on their qualifications and that can happen but uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh that's interesting
 		well
 		well i guess we've exhausted that one
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i think so  you too good-bye
 	
 	
 		enjoyed talking to you good-bye
