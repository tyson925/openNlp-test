 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so what kind of neat hobbies do you have
 	
 	
 		well i like gardening a lot i like to be outside um
 	
 	
 		i like gardening i wish i had a green thumb though
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i've got a brown thumb that's what everything turns
 	
 	
 		uh oh  is but do you try keep trying anyway
 	
 	
 		i keep trying uh you know you just can't can't give up on it uh i uh i bought some uh <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michigan Bulb Company</ENAMEX>  they send them to you all ready alive
 	
 	
 		no no i've never had any luck with their's
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i guess i guess these are going to croak too since i've got <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> i decided to get some catnip
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		lots and lots of catnip so it's it's still green and it's been <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two days</TIMEX> so i'm encouraged
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		no i i haven't had had good luck with that company uh i think some of it depends how long things stay in the mail probably
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but i've had to to get my money back from them and had better luck with with some of the the more expensive companies
 	
 	
 		yeah there's a uh i don't know do you have <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lowe</ENAMEX>'s up there
 	
 	
 		because they
 		uh well
 	
 	
 		its uh building uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">contractor</ENAMEX> or building supplies place
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		um they they also have a garden <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX> and they they offer just as good a guarantee if you buy it from them
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh that's great now our local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> don't don't offer any guarantee
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um
 	
 	
 		but some of the the mail order ones that i've dealt with for roses and that they offer through through the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> Summer
 	
 	
 		hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		which at least if they if they take off <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first year</TIMEX> they're probably going to come up unless there's uh a terrible freeze or something
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		yeah something like that uh i got a whole bunch of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">bulbs</ENAMEX> along with this stuff so i'm going to wait on those
 	
 	
 		oh they're bulbs for <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Spring or Fall</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh probably Spring but uh i don't much care about things like that i'll i'll make a little sort of greenhouse a miniature greenhouse to put all this stuff in
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		something something to keep me occupied you see
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i'll uh buy some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plastic</ENAMEX> and make a little <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		cute
 	
 	
 		yeah and watch the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> tear it up
 	
 	
 		
  
 		right i don't know that do <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> bother bulbs i think more the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> or other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rodents</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		they they just like to get in and dig
 	
 	
 		oh i see so if you have fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dirt</ENAMEX> they'll
 	
 	
 		oh they love to dig i had i had some uh i don't know what kind they are i've already forgotten just regular old flower seeds
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and i planted them and i was so i was so thrilled because they came up i mean nice green shoots coming up all over the place and then my <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> got into it and started digging and that took care of that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> gee
 	
 	
 		so i have to hang these things high so they can't get to them especially the catnip
 	
 	
 		how many <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> do you have oh okay

 	
 	
 		<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three</TIMEX>
 		
 
 	
 	
 		actually i just put a uh little fence around my yard uh um
 		which is i suppose technically illegal but i had so many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groundhogs</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> that i think they'll let me get by with it and it it's got this one inch mesh and what i've noticed it's kept the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> out and i love it
 	
 	
 		um yeah yeah because they they like to get in and fertilize things too but uh why would it be illegal
 	
 	
 		well because we have these <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> uh i live in a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">townhouse</ENAMEX> and anyway all of our areas have <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> that you have to get permission
 	
 	
 		oh
 		uh yeah right
 	
 	
 		and you know they want uh privacy fences
 	
 	
 		well if nobody yeah if nobody complains you're all right
 	
 	
 		right right well they do walking tours too so
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		but at least because i back up to um a hillside where the uh wild <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> are i think i can probably justify it
 	
 	
 		um
 		yeah an and if somebody raises a stink about it you can always go before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> and argue your case anyway
 	
 	
 		right right i mean
 	
 	
 		you know you don't have to put up with all these wild <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">critters</ENAMEX> coming into your property
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">right the first year</TIMEX> the deer ate my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garden</ENAMEX> and i was just astounded i'm going deer right here in the city
 	
 	
 		yeah right here Bambi
 	
 	
 		
 
 		exactly
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> gosh
 	
 	
 		and so
 	
 	
 		well let's see other than gardening which i fiddle at i'm not very good at what else do i mostly just computer stuff
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		i just like playing with my computer and doing stuff on that uh cooking that's not really a hobby it's a necessity but but i enjoy it i like to think that i'm a very good cook
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh great
 	
 	
 		hobbies that's about it i don't have much time for hobbies so uh
 		between being a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> and trying to run a business on the side you don't have a lot of time
 	
 	
 		right that keeps you busy
 	
 	
 		yeah and raising <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i mean that could become a hobby
 	
 	
 		well it's it started out as a hobby actually uh it just it developed into sort of a business uh you know we breed them and all that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		um
 	
 	
 		but we didn't you know we didn't really start it for the money it was just they were fun to have around and we figured if we're going to have them we might as well have some purebreds and
 		and now it developed in to going to <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> shows and finding studs for them and you know all this kind of stuff
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		uh-huh what kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> are they
 	
 	
 		uh i've got a uh a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bombay</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Van</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Himalayan Persian</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		yeah the himmy is probably the sweetest one she's she's just a little sweetheart
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		we uh the the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bombay</ENAMEX> had a litter uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last October</TIMEX> and i just got her back from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vet</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this morning</TIMEX> getting her spayed only going to breed them once
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		and uh she's not she's not feeling too great today
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">um</ENAMEX> is that typical to only breed them once
 	
 	
 		no uh most most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">breeders</ENAMEX> are in it for the money so they'll breed they'll breed them twice a year
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i i just think that it's kind of i do n't know it's kind of cruel you know they just they just breed these they breed them before they're ready uh and
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		you're never you're never real and and they they do a lot of inbreeding too and so you end up with you know kind of strange kittens
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i just don't like that
 	
 	
 		so will you uh breed one of the litter then next year
 	
 	
 		we're we sold all that litter
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		um
 		we there's not that much call to for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bombay</ENAMEX>'s
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um they're they're registered but they're not they're not uh they're not show cats
 	
 	
 		oh i see
 	
 	
 		uh so all you can do is sell them as pet quality
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh so what you've got is a registered pet and not too many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> want <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bombay</ENAMEX>'s they want things like himmy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Persians</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vans</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">Vans</ENAMEX> if you've never seen one i mean you wouldn't know that it was a pure bred it's just uh medium size short hair <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> it's got he's mostly white with uh brown and black patches
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		but they have nice <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personalities</ENAMEX> and they're very inquisitive
 		um now the himmy we'll probably breed her a couple of times and we'll we'll end up keeping one out of each litter and then breeding those
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		it's just the stud fees are so much though it'll cost <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about three hundred dollars</NUMEX> for a stud for her we we want to breed her with a champion so
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		right now these are long haired
 	
 	
 		yeah the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Persian</ENAMEX> is
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and the other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> are short hairs
 	
 	
 		right
 		oh that's nice
 	
 	
 		yeah she's uh she's sweet going to have some nice kittens i hope
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 	
 	
 		she's uh she's if you if you know what a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Himalayan</ENAMEX> is generally they look something like uh well they come in a lot of different colors <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> don't realize it but they're sort of like uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Siamese</ENAMEX> in a way they have the uh they have the uh
 		they have the gloves on the paws and they're they're usually <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> colored uh but this one is uh
 		is she's predominantly predominantly uh black but she has chocolate uh paws chocolate stomach and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">silver</ENAMEX> on her hindquarters
 		and yeah she's she's quite attractive looking
 	
 	
 		gee
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		hope hope the stud will find her attractive
 	
 	
 		and that she has kittens that look like her
 	
 	
 		and and that she has a whole bunch of kittens but we have to be careful uh you know we have to get a particular color point uh stud you can't just breed them with anything we have to get a uh we have to get a silver point himmy
 		so the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">silver</ENAMEX> will be predominate in the kittens
 	
 	
 		i see
 	
 	
 		that's it that's the fun part trying to figure out what you've got to breed them with can't just go out there and say okay you <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> breed you know
 	
 	
 		you can't just tell them that anyway but  oh dear well it really sounds like uh uh a business more than a hobby
 	
 	
 		that's right
 		well actually i mean it it is a business in a way but it it's a lot of fun as a hobby especially when you go to shows and get to see all the different <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> we're we're about to get another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">breed</ENAMEX> we're going we're going to buy a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Devon Rex</ENAMEX>
 		and i didn't i don't like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Devon Rexes</ENAMEX> at first it's a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">well</ENAMEX> actually it's a mutant it it comes from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX> and uh from in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">county</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Devon</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		what is it
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and it's a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mutant cat</ENAMEX> and they're they're pretty expensive we're going to we're going to shell out probably <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about a thousand</NUMEX> bucks for one um they're
 		very thin they're they're they're long and lanky and skinny and they have real short hair it's curly as a matter of fact
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		um yeah it it it's a strange looking cat uh i didn't like them at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> they've got great big ears
 	
 	
 		huh interesting
