 		well i i live in an apartment <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> and and uh and and
 		it it's just just not feasible you know i'd love to have a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i've got a little doggy uh that i've had quite uh quite a long time in fact she just turned <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixteen years old New Year</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eve</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		ah
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		is she
 	
 	
 		i beg your pardon
 	
 	
 		what is she
 	
 	
 		she's uh uh uh a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">poodle of a toy poodle a toy poodle</ENAMEX>  and she's
 	
 	
 		ah
 		ah my got my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mom</ENAMEX> a teacup poodle not too long ago
 	
 	
 		
 
 		this is a little bigger than a teacup
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh it's funny how uh how i i uh i got acquired this animal uh when i was uh married my uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ex-wife</ENAMEX> had said that she had a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> who had a little <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">puppy</ENAMEX> that she needed uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> needed someone to babysit
 		and uh this is what she had told the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> and she even told me that
 		and after the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two week</TIMEX> period was up
 		uh she then informed me that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> no longer wanted the little <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">puppy</ENAMEX> and wanted to know if we wanted to keep it well after you had an <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of weeks</TIMEX> it's uh you become attached you become attached to it
 	
 	
 		oh for sure
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		so i've had this <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> now for for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixteen years</TIMEX> and she's been a lot of company
 		uh she's uh
 		however getting a little old and things are starting to fail
 		um i i live alone now and she stays in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all day</TIMEX> while i go to work  and uh she's been holding herself pretty well
 		the uh up until uh you know recently where she's been having accidents in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> because she either is losing control or she forgets where she is  and uh i find a little present on the floor sometimes when i come home
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but she's she's usually pretty good
 	
 	
 		yes well my my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> has one it's uh it's uh teacup and uh it's made such a difference for her but you know just
 		i i i you know the way my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mom</ENAMEX>'s presence countenance it it's just just for having a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">puppy</ENAMEX> but you know having this <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> she's had it for i guess <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three years</TIMEX> now
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh possibly <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> but uh it was it it's it's really made such a difference from her i really would like to i'm a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">disabled person</ENAMEX> so i'm unable to to really take care of a pet and if if that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		weren't so i would certainly certainly have one i just i just it frustrates me sometime not being able to have a dog
 	
 	
 		um well you might wanna get yourself uh an <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> that doesn't require much attention like a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh yeah well yeah uh i i i typically am not a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> person
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		have a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> that uh has on occasion um brought her <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> over for me to keep for you know time to time and
 		and this <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> is like no other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> i have ever seen and uh uh it would sleep on my chest
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know it's just it is just a great <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well my my personal preference is is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> uh i don't know that uh that i'd ever want a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> oh i like <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> i just wouldn't wanna  own one uh they're not uh they're they're affectionate but they yeah i don't know i can't seem to communicate with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> like i can with my dog
 	
 	
 		yeah well you don't own <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX>
 		yeah you they they own you
 	
 	
 		yeah right
 	
 	
 		or or you know grant you with their presence you know
 	
 	
 		yeah right that your supposed to appreciate them well my my <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> when i came home uh when i come home in evenings she my <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> greets me at the door i don't know that a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> would do that uh
 	
 	
 		yeah i used to have a  that that could read me better than any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">human being</ENAMEX> in my life
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i could just walk in the door and she knew whether to to to quietly come up to me or to just run and and knock me over
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i mean she really could pick up on my mood  the way i walked in the door it was uncanny
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		hm
 		i i think um you know we're able to read each other pretty well because uh  she knows when i'm upset and i know when she's not feeling good too
 		so i know like when she has an accident i know she's not doing it on purpose
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		when she when she was younger she used to do that to get even with me
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh and</ENAMEX> and you know some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> might not believe that but uh but i do
 	
 	
 		oh hey sure
 		oh absolutely
 	
 	
 		like if i if i put her in a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> all by herself and close the door and leave her there for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a few hours</TIMEX> uh because i was going out
 		she would uh break something or rip up the carpet or do something just to uh to to let me know that she was unhappy with what i did yeah
 	
 	
 		really yes well i had that that <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> that i mentioned
 		i'll be <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one morning</TIMEX> and you know the first thing you do is you get up and you you you you you you feed this <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> something something and and you make sure that it can get to its litterbox well
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		some reason during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the night</TIMEX> the the door was not quite wide enough for it to get through
 		and uh <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the next morning</TIMEX> uh when my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">roommate</ENAMEX> got up and
 		and uh did not feed it right away
 		it decided that it was going to protest and so it jumped up on my bed and anointed my blanket for me looking looking at me eye to eye all the time while it was doing it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		all right have i got your attention now
 	
 	
 		oh yes <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> have a way of talking
 	
 	
 		well it did i tell you if i could have gotten a hold of that <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> that day
 	
 	
 		i i don't know that i'd uh that i'd trade my <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> in for the world uh it was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about two years ago</TIMEX> she got sick on me and i took her to the uh to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vet</ENAMEX>'s because she wasn't eating
 		and and uh she wasn't able to jump she you know lost all her activity  and uh she stayed there for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> called me up and said uh she had a low white <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> count and that
 		uh she wasn't she was dying and uh suggested that i take her to a working hospital <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog hospital animal</ENAMEX> hospital
 		so i took his suggestion and i  uh took the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">the dog</ENAMEX> to a hospital a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> hospital and they said that they'd keep her there for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three days</TIMEX>
 		well she ended up staying there <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five days</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred</NUMEX> and something dollars <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a day</TIMEX> because she was in intensive care i mean it cost me over <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">five hundred dollars</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		ouch
 	
 	
 		plus the the uh  the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vet</ENAMEX> sent me a bill for what he did
 		and uh and then she recouped she was okay for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of years</TIMEX> and then she got sick on me again and i brought her to a different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vet</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this time</TIMEX> and i told the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vet</ENAMEX> what medication i had given her and everything and uh he
 		gave me the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medication</ENAMEX> the same <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medication</ENAMEX> that i gave her the last time and she was okay and she's been okay ever since it's been <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about two years</TIMEX> now
 	
 	
 		uh
 		well that's great it really is i  i'm glad you she was able to pull out of it uh  and so cheaply the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> time
 	
 	
 		yeah well the see the problem is if if the if someone wouldn't have came up
 		to me and said it's gonna cost you <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">five hundred dollars</NUMEX> to keep your <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> alive what do you wanna do i probably would've had second thoughts but what they well what they do is is they say well it's gonna cost
 	
 	
 		yeah of course you would
 	
 	
 		you know <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty</TIMEX> dollars for tests and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">forty dollars</NUMEX> for this and and you know and it creeps up on you you don't know that
 		you know  you really you you don't know what it's gonna cost until it's all over
 	
 	
 		i
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh to give you an example my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mom</ENAMEX> uh had an elderly <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> who uh who evidently evidently got old uh and uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> got sick so she took the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vet</ENAMEX>
 		and she had the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> there for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two days</TIMEX> and then the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> died so the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> had called her up and said uh your <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> died and you owe me this bill
 		and oh by the way do you want me to to bury the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>  so it cost <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">her three hundred dollars</NUMEX> um and she didn't get the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> back so you know they had to pay for all the the medical uh bills that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> ran up plus the burial expenses
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and uh you know she just brought the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> in because he wasn't feeling good   so that that was a kind of a surprise  at least at
 	
 	
 		
 
 		really
 		jeez yeah you kind of wonder what really happened
 	
 	
 		yeah well even the you know they they claimed they did the best that they could and then the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat uh</ENAMEX> died so
 		now i'm looking for another <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> for them um i i've i've got a little kitten uh that's still uh oh it just being born <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">right now</TIMEX> so <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">another five or six weeks</TIMEX> i'll be bringing the little kitten over to uh to my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		my goodness
 		
   
 		well that that that that will make their day
 	
 	
 		yeah it i think it will because they're both in their in their seventies and uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> uh although it's a little bit of work for them sometimes turned out it turns out to be a a pleasant experience for them uh i think that they enjoy that
 	
 	
 		only work initially
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> anyway you know well listen it's been a pleasure talking to you
 	
 	
 		yep
 		well same here
 	
 	
 		and you take care
 	
 	
 		okay  bye now
 	
 	
 		yeah maybe  maybe we'll talk again sometime
