 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so uh have you got any
 		repairs done by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">auto</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shops</ENAMEX> on your <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> or do you do maintenance work or what
 	
 	
 		i uh try to do what i can
 		and uh
 		we have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicles</ENAMEX> uh
 		and uh on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Honda</ENAMEX> which is the older vehicle
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i try to do as much as i can on that
 		on our newer one uh uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mini vans</ENAMEX>
 		it's all electronic and computers and everything in it
 	
 	
 		still still under warrantee right
 	
 	
 		yeah uh well some things are some things aren't you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		not everything's covered by  warrantee
 		i don't try to mess with that at all i mean i i can change the oil and
 	
 	
 		do you do any uh body work on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Honda</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh no
 		uh no no i do have a place that's rusting i need to get something on it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		put some paint on it or something to stop the rust like scrape it and paint it right right right i know if you don't get the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">rust</ENAMEX> off that's there already that it's just going
 	
 	
 		yeah scrape it and paint it put primer on it then paint it
 		don't put paint over else it'll just continue rusting under it
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		continue on but yeah i was sitting here looking at my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Honda</ENAMEX> manual when i got the call
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i got the
 	
 	
 		so you you're ready to talk about it
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah right the uh
 	
 	
 		do you so you change like you change your own <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> filters
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i do my own brake brake work on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Honda</ENAMEX> i just
 	
 	
 		uh i mean i
 	
 	
 		i just finished working on the brakes
 	
 	
 		yeah i i know where you're coming from because i do the i do the minor things to my car
 	
 	
 		right right not the right the things i know how to do i i'm not an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX> i don't claim to be
 	
 	
 		uh but i don't
 		right exactly yeah i just do what i can i don't really you know i don't it's like the simple things changing the oil checking the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fluids</ENAMEX> you know rotating tires
 	
 	
 		hum right
 	
 	
 		things like that that you don't need heavy equipment for
 	
 	
 		right seems anymore you need special tools to do a lot of jobs you know and and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i'm afraid i'll get something take it taken apart and not remember how to  get it back together
 		and then i'd be in big trouble
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i do know a couple
 		good shade tree <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mechanics</ENAMEX> and i call them once in a while for advice and
 		once in a while for advice and once in a while they'll come over and say oh this is how you do it you know and i try to learn
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but i think a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> learn how to do maintenance from whether their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> did it
 		you know my didn't do much at all and didn't know much about <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		as a result i really didn't have that much interest to learn how to maintain fix and maintain <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		so i didn't learn much growing up and i just
 		after i we bought the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> you know and things got so expensive to take them someplace all the time
 	
 	
 		yeah because it
 	
 	
 		that i decided that i better start learning you know
 	
 	
 		yeah because things go wrong and you don't know what the hell's going on and you don't you don't know where to start
 	
 	
 		right
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		and that's where it costs money
 	
 	
 		well yeah that's that's when i call some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> or something or sometimes i just take it to a place you know and they'll tell me what's wrong and i'll say
 		oh it'll be this much money and i'll say oh well i'm going to think about that that sounds like too much
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		right now and so you know i got to think about that so they'll put it back together i'll take it home and then i'll
 		fix it myself sometimes they charge you you know just to diagnose the problem
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		some places do some don't right just depends you know how long how long it takes them to figure it out if they can just tell right away
 	
 	
 		those are electronical
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diagnostics</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">just</TIMEX> listening to it
 		and then they're usually going to charge you you know
 	
 	
 		yeah i have a a fuel injected engine so i don't do anything to the engine you know it's like
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah right they're pretty tricky
 	
 	
 		i don't i don't want to mess with it because since i don't know exactly all the ratios you know and everything that all the proportions
 		the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fuel</ENAMEX> and air and compression and all that stuff that needs to be precise and it's controlled by computer i figure i won't mess with that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		right that's how i figure on those things it's just not worth the
 		worth it
 	
 	
 		but i mean i play with everything else that you know that's not too serious you know you can bend it one way and you bend it right back or you know turn it
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		just as long as as like you were saying it's not too hard to take apart and put back together  i'll try it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh right
 		now that we have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> i'm not as scared to play with play around because we always have the other car
 		seems like i before i would get the
 		car all apart and realize i needed a part you know
 		and i'm calling all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> and stuff trying to
 		get them to give me a ride down to get my part you know because i don't have another part
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so now that we have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> i'm less leery about just going for it
 	
 	
 		have you had any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> work done on your car
 	
 	
 		um no no i haven't had any problem
 	
 	
 		that stuff is expensive
 	
 	
 		yeah i know i had an estimate for that little rust spot and they wanted like <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three hundred</NUMEX> bucks
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i said forget it
 		i can live with it you know if the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>'s
 	
 	
 		but
 	
 	
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten years old</TIMEX> now you know
 	
 	
 		yeah i went i went uh i got in a wreck recently and uh
 		well i didn't do much damage to my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> but i did some pretty heavy duty damage to the other <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> i have a plastic bumper
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i happened to hit the rim of the tire
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it made like a little semicircular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">incision</ENAMEX> on my plastic bumper
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">right and and</TIMEX> and kind of put little fissures on the on the paint of the bumper because it's plastic so when it bent you know when the plastic bent it kind of cracked
 	
 	
 		on your plastic bumper uh-huh
 	
 	
 		to to change that bumper covering of the plastic cover
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		was going to run me <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five hundred</NUMEX> bucks
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		whoa
 		that's on the other <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> or your car
 	
 	
 		on my car
 	
 	
 		is that right
 	
 	
 		that just to change the cover you know because do just had to get the that whole cover my my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>'s a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Beretta</ENAMEX>
 		they had a big big bumper they got on there big white bumper that covers like the whole bottom front of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> that that whole thing you know to be replaced and repainted would cost <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">five hundred dollars</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		right
 	
 	
 		and i got this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> to uh to this this uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> i don't know if you ever heard of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Maaco Auto Body Shop</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah i've heard of them
 	
 	
 		i got the i talked to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">owner</ENAMEX> and he said that the best thing to do if i wanted to save money was uh
 	
 	
 		the chain
 	
 	
 		to just go ahead and since there was no major damage he could just kind of like fill in the little ridges where the rim hit
 		with some like bond or something and then paint over it and it would look just like new for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two hundred</NUMEX> bucks so i did that instead
 	
 	
 		right
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but and it you can't tell you can't tell the difference you know it just looks like a brand new bumper
 	
 	
 		is that right
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and it hey i saved <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three hundred</NUMEX> bucks
 	
 	
 		yeah well you're a student right
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		so that's important
 	
 	
 		very important
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		it seems anymore for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> or
 		they want want so much to work on a car
 		we've had our <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealer</ENAMEX> or our <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">van</ENAMEX> and they want they charge like <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">forty five dollars</NUMEX> an hour labor
 	
 	
 		yeah i think that's ridiculous isn't it
 	
 	
 		golly they're
 		yeah i i
 	
 	
 		<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">forty five dollars</NUMEX> i mean <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people people</ENAMEX> get out of college and work for less than that
 	
 	
 		right well the mechanic doesn't see that you know
 		it's the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">owner</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealer</ENAMEX> who sees the big bucks
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mechanic</ENAMEX> probably gets about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty</TIMEX> dollars an hour
 		yeah the thing about <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">automobiles</ENAMEX> they're so unpredictable too you know they're hard to hard to plan ahead for for things
 	
 	
 		yeah like that commercial that you plan for uh the car new car <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garage</ENAMEX> but you didn't plan on breaking down
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		ever see that commercial
 	
 	
 		right
 		no i haven't seen that one
 	
 	
 		it's it's pretty good it's i think it's um a bank commercial or something like that
 		and uh it just kind of flashes out these uh partial sentences like you planned on and it says a new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garage</ENAMEX> second car
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and then all a sudden the music in the background changes and it says but you didn't plan on it breaking down
 	
 	
 		that's true that's true i mean it's hard to you know it's hard to say
 		oh i should set aside this much money for repairs on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> because you never know it could cost you nothing or it could cost you <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times as much
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's hard to plan for those things
 		and when you need to have it fixed you know a lot of times you can't just take it all over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> if it uh you know
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true
 	
 	
 		sometime you can but on some things it's
 		you're just stuck and you got to have it towed somewhere or something you just got to  got to
 		got to  got to make a quick decision
 		i don't know i don't trust a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who work on your <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> too i know this one <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> that works for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">dealerships</ENAMEX> as a
 		at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">dealerships</ENAMEX> they replace things they don't fix
 	
 	
 		that's that's uh that's one thing about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">dealerships</ENAMEX> is you don't i don't think you get the real quality work at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">dealerships</ENAMEX> because they have to work with so many <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> it just kind of
 	
 	
 		so they'd just rather replace something and charge you for the new part rather than just you know fixing the part
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and the part could be probably fixed you know for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a third</NUMEX> of the price of of a new one
 		but they that's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX> don't do that
 	
 	
 		yeah they want as much money as they can
 	
 	
 		oh sure sure they do and then they take your old part and sell it to some reconditioning <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and make money off of that too
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know
 		so anyway
 		well we got to got to have <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> in this
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">society</ENAMEX>
 		not like uh <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> and some other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> where they have good enough public transportation where you can just
 	
 	
 		yeah but i think
 	
 	
 		get anywhere you
 		need to go anytime you need to get there
 	
 	
 		yeah i think uh i think public transportation will move up though in the future
 		i mean i think we pretty much phased out the bus
 	
 	
 		well i hope so
 		right
 	
 	
 		but i think maybe uh you know um
 		like <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">subways</ENAMEX> you know public transportation such as <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">subways</ENAMEX> and monorails will probably come in
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		right right but it it's going to be a while i think but
 	
 	
 		well yeah i mean not nothing like in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next ten years</TIMEX> but more like in the next fifty to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		if i had a car uh the
 		a bus
