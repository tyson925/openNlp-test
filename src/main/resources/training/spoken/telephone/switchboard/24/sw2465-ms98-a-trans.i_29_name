 		oh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DSEG</ENAMEX> defense systems and electronics group
 	
 	
 		yeah something like that yeah they've changed their name so many times i've lost track so
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i see yeah
 	
 	
 		he works up in Plano
 	
 	
 		oh okay yeah i work on uh printers and the peripheral products <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX> basically
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>

 		oh
 	
 	
 		so we we do a lot of
 	
 	
 		i didn't even know they had anything like that
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> there's so they're i learned so many things that they they do they're into so many different things so
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah i just kind of
 		in for a while you know he had a he had uh one of those what are they top secret things you know where he couldn't talk about what he did so
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		for a while but then he switched jobs i don't understand half the stuff he does and i have uh
 	
 	
 		is he a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">programmer</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh</ENAMEX> software design <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineer</ENAMEX> so as
 	
 	
 		i see
 	
 	
 		they call it so but i have a degree in information management
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		which is computer you know
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		it's basically the more the business business end of it than the programming end of it you know
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		so but i've been at it for you know <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five years</TIMEX> so everything's changed so much i probably couldn't even  get a job right now it seems like it's changed so much so you know they've made such advances in computers so
 	
 	
 		really so uh
 		does your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> ever use uh a laptop or a notebook does he bring a little one home with him or
 	
 	
 		no huh-uh sometimes he brings he brought home a uh a portable one
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but uh it it quit working so he brought it brought it back and he just hasn't brought another <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> home but they did give him a new computer at work so
 	
 	
 		oh i see yeah we we build uh laptop and notebook computers here in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Temple</ENAMEX> also
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and those are really handy i mean we they they have modems in them you can send a fax from your PC
 	
 	
 		oh how nice no he doesn't have one of those so
 	
 	
 		but they're they're really what's that
 	
 	
 		he doesn't have one of those
 	
 	
 		yeah they're they're pretty handy because you know when i travel it's easy to check messages just you know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		plug in the phone to your computer and dial in and
 	
 	
 		yeah well my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> doesn't have to travel so
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 		yeah i just found out i'm going to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Denver</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> again
 	
 	
 		oh boy
 	
 	
 		so that kind of reeks havoc with plans
 	
 	
 		well at least you get to
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but it it's really not enough to
 		become a big hassle
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well that's good some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> enjoy the travel but i don't think i'd like it if he traveled
 		a lot so
 	
 	
 		i see
 	
 	
 		yeah i would love to have a computer they but they're so expensive
 	
 	
 		well i don't know there you can get well depends on what you consider expensive i mean you can get real high powered stuff now
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">under two thousand dollars</NUMEX> where you know just <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few years ago</TIMEX> it would have been <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">six seven eight nine thousand dollars</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah guess it's not it's all you know it's inexpensive compared to what it used to be but it's a lot to put into one
 	
 	
 		yeah it's still i mean you know <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">two thousand dollars</NUMEX> isn't just just pocket change to a lot of people
 	
 	
 		that's right no it's not  it's it's not pocket change so it's major so but maybe when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> get in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> that will be you know when they start needing something you know then that will be different but
 	
 	
 		yeah when i started at uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI i</ENAMEX> was a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> development student
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and finishing up at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> and so those papers really i mean it was nice having access to the
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		equipment to uh
 	
 	
 		yes i remember that i had to do
 		some of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>'s papers because i had access to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> but you know he his was more for scientific stuff than for word processing you know so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i did a lot of his papers
 		yeah they come in real handy that was a lifesaver
 	
 	
 		well how many different types of packages do you use
 	
 	
 		at home
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um all i the packages i i don't really use them i pictures is what i use that's the only um
 		outside development that we use most of it's just stuff that's been written in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> that i use
 	
 	
 		oh okay yeah golly i've got up up at work anyway i use uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">WordPerfect</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lotus</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		yeah i know those <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> i worked
 	
 	
 		GemDraw which is a
 		uh uh a a line draw package
 	
 	
 		uh-huh i've just used <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">WordPerfect</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lotus</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah you probably use <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> base or something like that for your uh data entry stuff that your talking about
 	
 	
 		um the most
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		a lot of the data entr y stuff they used uh
 		survey system and and um
 		you know just in-house programs to do what they needed i work
 	
 	
 		do you get to do you work at home all the time or just
 	
 	
 		well no i worked for this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> before i had my <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and they just wanted me to continue working for them at home doing other things so
 	
 	
 		oh that that was that worked out pretty good then
 	
 	
 		yeah it did you know i don't do i don't really don't do basic a lot of what i used to do i just do you know something really minor but
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it's something that nobody else wants to do
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and it's time consuming
 		so
 	
 	
 		so it keeps you in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> huh
 	
 	
 		that's right you know it gives me a paycheck you know it's only like the works only you know <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three weeks</TIMEX> goes for like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three to four weeks</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times a year
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know it's not something that's continual because you know the television ratings don't come out you know all the time they only come out <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> times a year so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but
 	
 	
 		boy i tell you if i could bring a computer <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> and do stuff here i'd get all kinds of stuff done phone's always ringing and
 	
 	
 		oh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> always asking me to do something else
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i've got a lot of especially right now we've got several new products coming out and i've got lots of documentation i need to review and some i need to revise
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh</ENAMEX> will they let you take a computer <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> to work
 	
 	
 		well yeah but you know i need to be at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> too you know  i've just got to deal with all those other things that happen but
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		a PC at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX> would really take a lot of the load off
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i bet yeah my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> he took <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> home when they when they had it you know they had a big deadline coming up and it was
 		looking a little touchy to meet so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well i've i've done that before on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a couple</NUMEX> times but that would make it just that much easier instead of bringing home a computer you just bring home <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a few</NUMEX> floppy disks you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh</ENAMEX> that's right i thought that would be you know because it's real nice with this because i don't even have to go into the office i've maybe been into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> once in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past three years</TIMEX> you know
 	
 	
 		oh my
 	
 	
 		they just um they just send me everything and pick it up <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">courier</ENAMEX> or whatever so you know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> that sounds really nice
 	
 	
 		yeah it is real nice you know i just deal with them on the telephone half the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> don't even know who they're talking to
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but i you know worked i know most of them well i can't say that a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> changed around there but most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> know who i am but i don't know who they are you know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		a lot of them just know me by name and phone voice
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah i've got a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX> that i've worked with like that as well
 	
 	
 		yeah you just know them by the telephone so but
 		well it's been good talking to you i think we've just got the subject
