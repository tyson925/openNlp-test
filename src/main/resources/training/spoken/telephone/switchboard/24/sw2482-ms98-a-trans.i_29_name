 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		anyway uh
 		time we spend with our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it seems almost as though <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> hate it
 	
 	
 		do they
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> spent with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mom</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> is uh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">next</ENAMEX> is that's probably one of the worst punishments on earth to them
 	
 	
 		yeah especially when they get like into the teenage stage
 	
 	
 		and
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i guess
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i
 	
 	
 		yeah i remember when i was that age
 	
 	
 		they
 		you know
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> are a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">curse</ENAMEX> that they just have to live with
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so it it's interesting
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		we do spend time driving in the mountains
 	
 	
 		uh-huh oh how nice
 		i would love to live up there
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		do you work for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you're working then
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		with every passing day we wonder if we will be
 	
 	
 		that's what i heard
 		i've always thought about maybe transferring up there and i thought if i do that i might  not have a job
 		so
 	
 	
 		it's
 		it's better to  to be employed
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		especially <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these days</TIMEX> where there is not a job right around the corner
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 		i know it
 	
 	
 		and that creates family tensions
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i'm sure it does
 		so you only have the you only have the stepdaughter at home you all don't have any other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> around there
 	
 	
 		yes
 		no no i don't have any any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh</ENAMEX> so how does she feel about going out and doing stuff with you all
 	
 	
 		uh
 		well it varies what it is of course
 		but usually mom and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> are a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">curse</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know they
 		they'd much rather be with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends friends</ENAMEX> are cool <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> aren't
 	
 	
 		oh yeah  no huh-uh
 	
 	
 		but i remember
 		
 
 		well i'm sure part of it is a male female thing you know i i remember whenever i was growing up
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		often times spent with my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dad</ENAMEX> was oh just wonderful you know go
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		go hunting or
 		go to the races or
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		or oh any number of things
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and
 		we'd have
 		um great times
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and it seems that well now the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX>'s not available
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and entirely too much time is spent my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> and i were wondering what if
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and and what if's always rough
 	
 	
 		oh yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		but you know we do have our trips and we do have our fun and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i don't know little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> aren't interested in lot of the same things little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> are or were
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		like fishing and
 	
 	
 		hunting and and
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		looking for arrowheads and
 	
 	
 		my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>'ll say that he'd like to have a little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> to take hunting and fishing and i'd say well you can take a little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> hunting and fishing just as easily
 	
 	
 		uh but they don't like it
 	
 	
 		that's probably right
 	
 	
 		there there there is a difference there
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and the and
 	
 	
 		yeah well if my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> had done that when i was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX> i probably wouldn't have liked it i go now with my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and i enjoy it but
 	
 	
 		well
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> at that age
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		video games <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">malls</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		not necessarily in that order
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> of course
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and
 		that's a little tough for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fathers</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		i imagine
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fathers</ENAMEX> don't even like <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">malls</ENAMEX>
 		they despise shopping
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		so is that quality time
 	
 	
 		huh no i think not
 	
 	
 		yeah if
 		but there is camping and we both enjoy that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh she likes to do that
 	
 	
 		somewhat yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah well that's good
 	
 	
 		getting up in the mountains and
 		getting away from it all and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		that's somewhat fun
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it's
 	
 	
 		she  huh
 	
 	
 		so what do you think about
 		child rearing is
 		how how would you spend time with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		probably doing outdoorsie stuff and keep them trying to keep them away from the TV i guess
 		and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McDonald's</ENAMEX>  i i've always said that if i had a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX> they wouldn't know what <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McDonald's</ENAMEX> is
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		but i guess they learn from their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> don't they
 	
 	
 		yeah but
 		well yeah and
 		amazingly a lot of times it's
 		real easy
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know
 		a lot of times whenever we head out of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> on a trip or something
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it's real easy to swing in there for breakfast
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		breakfast and run and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		breakfast is a kind of a funny meal anyway
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		it is
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> eat funny
 	
 	
 		this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX> in our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bass club</ENAMEX> we had a tournament <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> and she was talking about her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one week</TIMEX> her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> won't uh will be on a no meat kick and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one week</TIMEX> she'll eat nothing but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Twix</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">candy bars</ENAMEX>
 		you know it's she just eats weird
 	
 	
 		and little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> are worse about it than little boys
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		they
 	
 	
 		
 
 		they're always wanting to go on a diet or something
 	
 	
 		or or something yeah go on a diet or they
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		they have a
 		well
 		to some extent the public <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> in general
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		influence them
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		the eating <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meat</ENAMEX> kick
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know it like it's really morally wrong to eat <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meat</ENAMEX> or something i i'm not sure
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>

 		that they can borrow for a time

 		because everyone needs some torture in their lives
 	
 	
 		my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> used to put that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">curse</ENAMEX> on my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> i hope you have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> just like yourself  and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandmother</ENAMEX> must have put that on my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> because he got my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> she's just like him
 		
  
 	
 	
 		uh but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jenny</ENAMEX> is a sweet kid
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm sure she is
 	
 	
 		and
 		and yeah we do do things and

 		as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		to go do

 		you know
 	
 	
 		i mean what
 	
 	
 		we were talking about how much it cost to go to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Disney Land</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">golly a couple three</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">hundred dollars</NUMEX>

 		oh
 	
 	
 		and
 		i understand <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Flags</ENAMEX> is real expensive now
 	
 	
 		it's uh i heard it's <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty</TIMEX> bucks a whack for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that is awful high

 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty</TIMEX> bucks a whack now
 	
 	
 		yeah or <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty one</TIMEX>

 		yeah everything's free except for the food and stuff

 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh for a family you know for a family it gets pretty expensive pretty quick and rent a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> when you get there and all that yeah
