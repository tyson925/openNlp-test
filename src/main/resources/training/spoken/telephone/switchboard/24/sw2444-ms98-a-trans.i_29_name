 
     		
 	
 		well uh what do you know what the last repair was uh that that you had done to your car
 	
 	
 		i think the last one we had done on a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> had to do with uh the transmission i and i'm not sure exactly what it was that they did i  speaking from other ignorance
 	
 	
 		i see
 		
 
 		right
 	
 	
 		what about your car
 	
 	
 		um well i i i guess the last thing that we had done uh
 		was probably we had to have new tires put on it and uh it's sort of a long story we had to get our <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> inspected uh for the state inspection sticker and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh the the gas <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX> i didn't know this but the gas <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX> if they reject your <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> uh they put an x on your inspection sticker and and uh you have to go back to that same <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">station</ENAMEX> to get it inspected
 	
 	
 		oh you can't go to a different one
 	
 	
 		you can't go to a different <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> and they didn't pass our tires our tires on uh on my car
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so uh what they didn't pass the uh the back tires the two back tires so what i did i went down and bought <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> new uh tires had them put on the front and then my front tires were just rotated to the back
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh so i went back to the gas <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX> and uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> said well your back tires still don't pass
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and i said no you've got to be kidding because i i just moved them and i told him what i did and he got his little gauge out and said well these don't pass
 	
 	
 		oh my
 	
 	
 		so then i had to go back and buy <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> more oh Lord i was so frustrated with that but uh
 	
 	
 		buy <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> more
 		
 
 	
 	
 		besides routine oil changes i guess that was about the uh the last last major thing that we've had done to the car
 	
 	
 		well that i had forgotten my uh i i i have a little <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">station wagon</ENAMEX> that i drive to work and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> has a a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">van</ENAMEX> that he uses in his business
 	
 	
 		i see
 	
 	
 		and he had a similar experience to yours just i'm thinking it was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX> or or it it it was certainly within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last couple of weeks</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">uh</ENAMEX> went to get his uh sticker renewed and had a couple of little things like the clip that holds the uh oh the muffler pipes
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		up up had broken or sheared or whatever and they measured the tread and i didn't know they did that to the tires
 	
 	
 		well see i didn't either until it happened
 	
 	
 		and he had to get <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> new ones too so  i i i'd never heard of it before so my mouth was open the when you mentioned that that circumstance
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		right right well i tell you what ever since then i found a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">station</ENAMEX> that uh uh pretty close to our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX> that
 		you know the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> is pretty lenient on the inspection stickers so uh he's definitely going to get my business i tell you but uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well yeah you you want it you want them to check what's what's needful for your safety and so forth but the other sounds like a fluke when they didn't do it
 		you you you should have known when you went in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time uh the if there were if you needed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> tires okay fine but tell me all at the same time
 	
 	
 		that's right you know that the
 		exactly and uh i don't know it made me sort of question you know their their techniques for testing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> it was almost like they were just trying to get to me and uh i know they probably weren't but that's uh
 	
 	
 		you can't help feeling that way
 	
 	
 		the outlook yeah yeah that's right and plus me being uh uh not not a mechanic you know i i always uh have the feeling that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are out to get to me and i don't know any better you know so
 	
 	
 		that's that's a common feeling i i i empathize because um i well i'm real glad my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> knows something about <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> but when i go in i feel really at a loss
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right
 	
 	
 		and and if we take my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> in to be fixed he'll he'll tell them what he wants and then he'll say well well call my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> if there's anything else that needs to be done  and then they call me at work because he he doesn't work near uh uh uh doesn't
 	
 	
 		oh Lord
 		have a phone i see
 	
 	
 		have uh office yeah a phone and and so they'll call me and say well Mrs <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Parker</ENAMEX> we've got some good news and we've got some bad news the problem we thought about <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this morning</TIMEX> is not a problem but the real problem is is uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right
 	
 	
 		and so the only way that i the only thing i know to do in in is if it sounds plausible i'll say go ahead and do it but save me the parts or something so i can have him look at it
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		and that's the only thing that saved us is is his background there
 	
 	
 		i see well i i wish i would have been paying more attention when i was out messing around with uh my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> when he was uh out looking at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> he's he's a pretty good little handy man
 		but uh i i never did pay any attention never i never really was very interested in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> so uh i'm i'm just the type that if it's got <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> in it it should it should be going
 	
 	
 		that's
 		that's
 	
 	
 		and i need to be better because uh uh we just bought it my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> and i just bought a new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> and uh you know we want to take real good care of it so uh
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		i'm trying to have the oil changed at the the right times and things like that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		all that scheduled maintenance right
 	
 	
 		that's right that's right you know that uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">forty dollars</NUMEX> you have to pay <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every so many months</TIMEX> to to keep the thing in hopefully good shape
 		but uh i think i guess it'd be better to pay it out now than a big <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lump</ENAMEX> sum down the road
 	
 	
 		that's the truth that's the truth i always wanted to know a little bit more but i think it was more to show off
 	
 	
 		but
 		right
 	
 	
 		when i was growing up and i before before i was married i was teaching <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> and teaching down in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Corpus Christi</ENAMEX> and i wanted to be able to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">at least</NUMEX> change a flat tire
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arlington</ENAMEX> where my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> lived and down there and so i i had <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX> i had said told my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> i said now i know everybody's suppose to change tire know how but i said i can't do that will you help me will you show me
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and so i had him out there and he was helping and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> came to the door and said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry</ENAMEX> you've got a phone call so he went in to talk to one of his many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> and i i'm i'm down i'm there with this tire off
 	
 	
 		right
 		oh Lord
 	
 	
 		so i thought i have better things to do i can do this myself and so oh i guess i was getting ready to start that was it it wasn't even off so i started
 		jacking it up and and and so forth and somehow or other the the jack slipped it's one of those that has the ratchet kind of thing
 	
 	
 		just taking it off
 		oh Lord right
 	
 	
 		and i reached out to grab it and it caught the the webbing between my thumb and my my forefinger
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		it caught the and i couldn't do anything i fortunately it was loose it was no longer under the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> and i i i could not get my my i could just see me through the rest of my life with this
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">jack</ENAMEX> attached to my hand and i i couldn't see anybody on the street no other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> all over so i went to the to the door
 	
 	
 		oh Lord
 	
 	
 		and it was summertime the air conditioner was on the door was closed and i couldn't knock because i had to hold the jack with the other hand i finally with my elbow rang the doorbell and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> came to the door
 	
 	
 		oh jeez
 	
 	
 		and i wouldn't let her touch me i i wanted my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> to help me with this that was a shock the he put the phone down pretty quickly and it didn't take him long to extricate
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		my hand but oh i was scared to death i i i could see him cutting out my my whole palm just to get this little flap of skin out so that's that's how mechanical i am
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that's hilarious
 		to to get that jack off that's right oh that's a funny story
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and that was oh that was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty five years ago</TIMEX> so i i've not tried it since oh plus plus before this i had put all the lugs back in place
 	
 	
 		oh Lord
 		
 
 		right
 	
 	
 		but i had the wrong side out i didn't know there was a right and wrong side the thread worked
 	
 	
 		oh Lord oh jeez
 	
 	
 		and so i was so proud after he got me extricated he looked at went out there to check it over
 		and he just laughed he said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sissy</ENAMEX> i'm sorry  but we're going to redo this
 	
 	
 		
 
 		they're on backwards huh oh jeez all that work and
 	
 	
 		so uh
 		listen i'll call Triple A uh auto <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">club</ENAMEX> any time
 	
 	
 		that's right any time that's right well that's uh that's the way i feel i i feel like i i work uh hard enough and make enough money i i can pay somebody to take care of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it it it'll save your fingers trust me
 	
 	
 		so uh that's right  that's right well hey i appreciate the conversation
