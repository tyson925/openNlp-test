 
     		
 	
 		
 
 		okay um
 	
 	
 		let's talk talk about the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Middle East</ENAMEX> situation
 	
 	
 		the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> involvement in
 		i guess even though
 	
 	
 		now that it's all over with you know it's
 	
 	
 		well it is over but i don't think we're out of there by any means and uh and i wonder are we going to set up uh you know peace keeping type <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> for long term and
 		you know is that something we should do or shouldn't do i don't know
 	
 	
 		i don't know uh i understand that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> talking about leaving
 		more of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX> and things over there uh i guess they uh
 		they were anti <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> in that region and now they're you know like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Syria</ENAMEX> and uh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">um Egypt</ENAMEX> you know had some had some pressure against the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> but now they now and they wouldn't allow us to have a base in the region but now i think they're rethinking that
 	
 	
 		i think that's true because i think they saw the support that came through
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		the other thing that i think is good for like <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX> are to be involved is the the reports that i hear back and of course on the news i i try to
 		listen and and also read between the lines you know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but uh they said that because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Americans</ENAMEX>
 		you know took such a proactive stance involvement involvement in the war that like so much of the building business and rebuilding <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuwait</ENAMEX> and things like that will go to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX> where as before they may be dealt with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX> or other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> they said even though the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japanese</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		were involved monetarily uh they fill like the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first first</NUMEX> priority ought to go to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX> which i guess will be good you know which will be good for our economy
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		but i you know when
 	
 	
 		since they have get so much of our money for from oil anyway
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> don't you know i mean we don't seem to slow down even when there's a crisis
 	
 	
 		no no um yeah i think that's that's a nice gesture on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Kuwaiti</ENAMEX> government part to do that and uh
 	
 	
 		but i
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and a few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> i guess will make a few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> pretty wealthy in construction and so forth
 	
 	
 		i imagine your oil <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> they may see a probably the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> big rise in business they've seen in years
 	
 	
 		i'm
 		right
 		go over there and rebuild all those
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i think it's such a shame that
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iraqis</ENAMEX> had to just go destroy everything everything i was just
 	
 	
 		i do too
 	
 	
 		i mean what's what good is that i mean if i can't have it you can't have it you know that sounds like something a little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX> would do you know
 	
 	
 		yeah but look at their war that was his whole war is is i'm not satisfied with what <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> has i want what everybody has
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		and and you're right it's like you you you see <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> little pre school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> fighting over a toy you know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so i i'm a little concerned about you know i know they're putting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> right now in uh awkward position concerning the the
 	
 	
 		the uh
 	
 	
 		the treaty over there right now you know what the what am i trying to say
 	
 	
 		the uh deal with the uh supporting the uh <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Kurds</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		well supporting the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Kurds</ENAMEX> but um
 		you know where the the cease fire i'm trying i forgot  yeah you know because he
 	
 	
 		right right the cease fire
 	
 	
 		he wants he wants them to uh uphold their end of the deal as far as the cease fire but at the same time he's not wanting to go in and say okay i'm gonna fight your war for you which which i think is is right
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know if it's an internal thing i don't think we can walk in and say gee i think you're right you're wrong you know we're not the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> and jury
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh but i know that that's causing him a little bit of unpopularity with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> over there because they feel like geez you you told us to stand up against him but you're not helping and so i think he's in a pretty awkward position now and i i i think we ought to help
 	
 	
 		got to help us
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know
 	
 	
 		maybe supply some <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX> or something
 	
 	
 		yeah supply <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX> support them if they need help but i don't think we ought to be over there fighting it for them and and so i think he's done good on that stance
 	
 	
 		yeah i think <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> handled has handled this uh whole situation quite well
 		he stood up to to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bully</ENAMEX> and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		didn't back down and uh and uh uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX> miscalculated all along
 	
 	
 		boy i would say
 	
 	
 		thinking that it he wouldn't commit <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">US</NUMEX> lives and and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> and and monies
 		to just to liberate a little country
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		and uh then then he underestimated underestimated his ability to uh to uh
 		wage a war with us i mean uh it's one thing when we all came over there and said okay here we are get out
 		and he said no i'm i i can i can win a war with you guys
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		and that and that was a a horrible miscalculation i mean
 	
 	
 		i agree you know they had advertised and and said news that he had the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX> largest army <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">well</ENAMEX> he may have but you have to well not anymore but you have to have loyalty you have to have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who believe in your cause
 	
 	
 		uh
 		not anymore
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know if i i i i know they tried to turn it into a holy war because to them that is what's honorable you know to to if you die in in a holy cause but but i think they're smart enough see there was nothing holy about it we just wanted their land and took it you know  um
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah
 		right
 		yeah he he is not a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX> is not a religious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> but he uses it
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		when it when he sees it to his advantage
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		and i think the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> were smart enough to realize that you know <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hussein</ENAMEX> that that i think they're afraid of him is what they are the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> is is afraid to speak out against him and
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		and uh and i don't think he's going to be there too much longer
 	
 	
 		well i hope that's true
 	
 	
 		uh someone's going to assassinate him you know i mean yeah
 	
 	
 		i would think so i would think that you know it i guess in the back of my mind i think like maybe the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli Israeli</ENAMEX> Massad probably has ideas of going in and  you know basically i i thought they uh
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		showed a a tremendous restraint in their reactions towards everything and but i don't believe for a minute that that means that they don't have ideas and plans of their own
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		that's right right
 	
 	
 		uh but i do agree with you i think <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> handled it all politically very smart you know getting the support of of the other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arabs</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nations</ENAMEX> in the world and and i think that's how you have to go into something like that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right right  i've heard reports that uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> was staking his future
 		on this uh this war and that uh setting a precedent saying that
 		um this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">League of Nations</ENAMEX> uh will will always combine against bullies and and to stop this kind of stuff in the world any any would be <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bully</ENAMEX> would think twice if he knew that
 		you know there's this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Nations</ENAMEX> or world <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> or whatever they keeps talking about with that that will that the whole world will deal with you
 	
 	
 		well and don't you feel
 	
 	
 		and you can't get away you just can't do it and get away with it and you know hoping that you know because it's a it's a world thing and <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">and and</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nations</ENAMEX> will combine against you
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		a nd uh you can't you know can't just do this
 	
 	
 		and don't you think that long term that's been a big boost for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Nations</ENAMEX> i mean the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Nations</ENAMEX> has been there for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> but all of a sudden uh
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		had no had no teeth
 	
 	
 		yeah there're some teeth behind it and some fact that when they have sanctions and and we support things like this it means something
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and i think that's good for the strength of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Nations</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> i uh i guess i feel sorry for just the average you you know <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Iraqi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Iraqi</ENAMEX> who's had to go through all this and and suffering i'm sure with with no water you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and rebuild from nothing
 	
 	
 		no electricity you know sanitation must be terrible living conditions must be terrible and
 	
 	
 		yes
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and it's not getting any better the sanctions are still on
 	
 	
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		you know except for a few medical supplies they're allowing through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">now</TIMEX> and uh powdered <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk</ENAMEX> i guess for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">babies</ENAMEX> and things and
 		until they i guess <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> they came out with this uh these these rules i guess or whatever and they for a permanent permanent cease fire and the Kuwaitis
 	
 	
 		right they supported it
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kuwaitis</ENAMEX> said we don't want to have to go repay <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> for all the bombing we did that was in there you know but that's only fair
 	
 	
 		that's right yeah they did ask that they build up uh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuwait</ENAMEX> and i think they should have to
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		they lost
 	
 	
 		yeah the it's going to be really tough for them to swallow but but we don't want a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuwait</ENAMEX> there that's also you know just has no power at all and and and that you know because <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> still isn't too friendly with them
 	
 	
 		well that's true
 	
 	
 		and and we don't want you know it'd be be stabilized to the point where <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> will say now is our chance you know go in and wipe them out and
 	
 	
 		well i don't think <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX>'s under the same type of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">madman</ENAMEX> type leadership
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		but there's always the possibility i guess
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah  since <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Khomeini</ENAMEX> died over there things have got a little more normalized normalized not quite as radical a stance more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">moderates</ENAMEX> are in power now
 	
 	
 		i think so
 		i think i think the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> who really maybe at this time has a hard road to tow is uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jordan</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hussein</ENAMEX> because he really
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		kind of tried to straddle the fence you know he he wasn't necessarily for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> at the same time he didn't feel like everybody else ought to be going against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		was put in the middle
 		yeah
 		well yet so many of the his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> are the uh
 		the what what <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Lebanese</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		who who were hoping this would get evolve into a war against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		trying to connect with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> all that time and there really was no connection at all
 	
 	
 		none
 	
 	
 		and uh but boy those <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Lebanese</ENAMEX> in in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jordan</ENAMEX> they were saying you know this whole war is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX>'s fault because <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> told the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> to attack <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> it was all you know like like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> controls our government
 	
 	
 		i know and isn't that amazing the way that they'll find their cause and and and no matter what situation they see they're going to find their cause whether it's truly exists or not
 	
 	
 		uh you know
 		right well one thing i i did learn is is how deep
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and the the hatred runs toward <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> by a lot of countries
 	
 	
 		i know
 	
 	
 		they just hate i mean anyway anyway they can you know
 		they can see to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">to to</NUMEX> to connect them to something and hate them more i mean just they just
 		i understand most of the land is now <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> they bought
 	
 	
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		actually purchased it and and and then moved in and started a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> but
 	
 	
 		but see you're also getting back to the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the ages old</TIMEX> problem of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> conflict as far as personalties and who's the selected <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of God and it theirs ties in so much to their religion and
 	
 	
 		oh
 		right oh
 		yeah right right and they both have holy holy sanctions
 	
 	
 		so it's very different things than what we face
