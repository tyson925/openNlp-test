 
     		
 	
 		all right
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh
 		okay are you on an exercise program now or
 	
 	
 		yeah i exercise pretty regularly
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i lift weights quite a bit
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um i run occasionally
 		let's see what else do i do play golf some
 		and
 		i work out on a
 		a hanging bag i'm brown belt in karate so i keep up with that a little bit
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		how about you
 	
 	
 		um the only exercise program i'm doing right now is walking
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i've got a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nine month old</TIMEX> and i'm <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four months</TIMEX> pregnant with my <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> and so at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the time</TIMEX> walking seems to be the best it's something i can do with her plus um
 		doesn't tax me too physically
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i have enjoyed aerobics in the past and i enjoy that because i like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group association</ENAMEX> you know like exercising with other people
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and um
 		and that's my favorite way to exercise
 	
 	
 		well that's neat
 	
 	
 		but
 	
 	
 		yeah i do walk some too my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about five months</TIMEX> along so she's been walking quite a bit so that that is a good exercise for that
 	
 	
 		oh
 		yeah it's it's it's nice to do it together too i guess
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		because my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> and i used to walk together but our schedules don't coincide as well as they used to and so
 		we very seldom get together to walk but
 		when you when you work out do you pretty much do it on your own schedule or do you go to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> or
 	
 	
 		i i i do it on my own schedule
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		we used to try and belong to
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clubs</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX> stuff like that but it so difficult to go on a regular basis to drive to drive the distance you have to go and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		save the fees we've decided we just save the fees and and buy some of our own equipment so
 	
 	
 		and then you can do it whenever you want i guess
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i've got a weight bench and we got my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> an exercise bike and i use that sometimes too
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so it's a little more convenient but you're i guess you're not as dedicated if you don't drive over do it
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i guess it depends on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> depends on how motivated you are
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		because my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> used to work out <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three days a week</TIMEX> with uh at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texas Instruments</ENAMEX> gym
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and then i would just go on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturdays</TIMEX> but  since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first of the year</TIMEX> neither one of us have been going
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so  you know like you said we've been paying these fees and not going so it's kind of a a waste of money if you don't take advantage of it
 	
 	
 		yeah i i think you really have to be disciplined
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i uh i i try to work out at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least a couple of</NUMEX> times a week
 		and i i think you really have to at least twice <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a week</TIMEX> just to maintain the shape that you're in
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh with the walking i think they they said you need to walk <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">at least twelve miles</NUMEX> a week for it to be aerobically
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">beneficial</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and we i have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> that we walk they have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">babies</ENAMEX> that are about the same age as as <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mine</ENAMEX> and we've been walking every <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> at going when it was cold we'd go to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mall</ENAMEX> it's because you can't take the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">babies</ENAMEX> out very easily
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so uh so we when we go we have about do <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about fifteen miles</NUMEX> a week but the last little while for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> the reason or another we haven't been real consistent so
 		it's a little harder when you depending on other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to do it with you
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		because you have to meet their schedules as well but
 	
 	
 		true
 	
 	
 		but i enjoy doing it more when i've got other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with me than
 		and i usually do it because i want to because i know it's good for me not because you know i don't i don't feel obligated to do it and i enjoy it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		if i if i feel too obligated to do it i i start to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rebel</ENAMEX> and i won't be as consistent with it
 	
 	
 		yeah i understand
 		did you exercise between your <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> and your second
 	
 	
 		i uh i exercised pretty well up until i found or until i was pregnant and i started having pains so i've calmed down everything except i was working out doing aerobic exercises as well as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">um</ENAMEX> walking
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i had to stop the aerobics because it was just kind of
 		painful but the the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> rec <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> has an aerobics program for for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">um prenatal</ENAMEX> and postnatal aerobic type thing
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		and i was going to wait until um about my <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixth month</TIMEX> and then start doing that i did that with the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> and um i went to my exercise class exercise class <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX> and then she was delivered <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next day</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		gosh
 	
 	
 		so it it would seem to be real beneficial
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 		maybe it maybe it speeded up the process and all that
 	
 	
 		well i think it made parts of it a lot easier i i is this your first that you're having
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh okay well then i don't know how much you've been through it but um i think parts of it made a lot easier
 		and i've talked to a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ladies</ENAMEX> that exercise with one pregnancy and didn't with the other and they said that they'd exercise the one that had exercised was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three or four</NUMEX> times easier and
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		and we've i had having both of them natural the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> one was natural and going natural the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> and
 		and it was it's rough but it's not as as bad as i thought it would be
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i think the exercise helped
 	
 	
 		well that's good
 	
 	
 		so do you work with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		no i don't
 		my my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> has been working with them
 	
 	
 		oh okay well then she could go if she was interested
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i think that's what the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> that meets on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">mornings</TIMEX>
 		so she could
 		find out if she wanted to go
 		it's kind of fun because with the first pregnancy all the other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ladies</ENAMEX> except <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> were on their <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> pregnancy and they would talk about exercise and just general things related to the birthing process and
 		so for it's so it's educational as well as it exercise exercise beneficial so
 	
 	
 		yeah at least its something that you enjoy and i know a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that talk about exercise and say well i don't want to exercise it's too much work but there a lot of different things you can do that that
 		are enjoyable that you don't have to you kn ow strain yourself or sweat
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		be real sore afterwards
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and sometimes that's if you get a little soreness you feel like well i've done a good job because i got worked myself to that point but i guess you don't want to overdue
 		but
 		well have we reached our limit i'm not sure how long we've been talking but
 	
 	
 		yeah i think i think we've
 		talked <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about six minutes</TIMEX> or so so
 	
 	
 		okay well it's been good talking to you
 	
 	
 		it's been good talking to you as well
 	
 	
 		okay i hope your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> goes well comes out well  bye-bye
 	
 	
 		thanks yours yours too bye-bye
