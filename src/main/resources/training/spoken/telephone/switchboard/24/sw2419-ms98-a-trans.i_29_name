 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hey Dick</ENAMEX> who's your favorite team
 	
 	
 		i think i'm going to have to go with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicago Bears</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh how come
 	
 	
 		well i like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike Ditka</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and um
 		of course i used to like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim McMahon</ENAMEX> and you know uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter Payton</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but they got rid of them but i still like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ditka</ENAMEX> and i think they've got still got a pretty good <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> if they could just find a real good quarterback
 	
 	
 		yeah they really uh uh they found out that all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> that were backing up uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McMahon</ENAMEX> when they got to be the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> weren't all that good after all
 	
 	
 		yeah i was kind of i was i was disappointed they came along pretty good but but they just didn't have anybody that could actually go in there and win the game
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		Tomczak was was trying hard but he just can't do it
 	
 	
 		yeah and or they found that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tomczak</ENAMEX> really wasn't a he was a good backup <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">quarterback</ENAMEX> was what he was
 	
 	
 		he's not a starter
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah he wasn't the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> to take them take them to the championship
 	
 	
 		so i'm hoping maybe they'll draft a good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">quarterback</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> i don't know who they're gonna get but i hope
 	
 	
 		yeah i don't i don't know what's out there for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">quarterbacks</ENAMEX> and they've got a what about a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid a mid</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> round choice i think
 	
 	
 		yeah they don't have much in the way of rounds but who knows if they don't get one maybe they can trade for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> after all you know i <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Orleans</ENAMEX> picked up uh old uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Montana or Walsh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		yeah yeah yeah <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Walsh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		who's your favorite team
 	
 	
 		yeah he had had had sort of mixed success with them uh when he was there but
 	
 	
 		i think he'll be okay once he gets on
 	
 	
 		well i i think once he goes into training <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camp</ENAMEX> with them and gets <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a full year</TIMEX> at uh to do it it it'll work out okay for him i
 		uh you know i uh he didn't have a chance here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> because my gosh <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aikman</ENAMEX> was the number one choice number one draft choice uh and with a long term <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six year</TIMEX> contract
 	
 	
 		and a bunch of and a bunch of money oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and they were paying him a lot of money so <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walsh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walsh</ENAMEX> didn't have that much uh well as you probably guessed i'm a Cowboy fan
 		uh more or less
 	
 	
 		gee that's too bad
 	
 	
 		and well it's hard uh because
 	
 	
 		that's too bad
 		it must get a long time between thrills
 	
 	
 		yeah uh i was here in nineteen <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixty</TIMEX> well i got to go back that i moved down from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX> in in fifty <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> and uh in fifty <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> i really became a pro football <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fan</ENAMEX> went to all the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Steelers</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> games
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and they finished <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that year</TIMEX> i guess and it was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bobby Lane</ENAMEX>'s first it was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bobby Lane</ENAMEX> got traded to them <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> games into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the season</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh so that's where i started cutting my teeth on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFL</ENAMEX> and then i got to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> and we didn't have any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFL</ENAMEX> in fifty <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> so i sat and watched uh watched it on television
 		then at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the fifty nine season</TIMEX> when they announced we're gonna get a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixty</TIMEX> i went out and bought <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX> tickets and i was in the first twelve season ticket holders
 	
 	
 		good grief
 	
 	
 		for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cowboys</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you still got them
 	
 	
 		uh yeah except i don't use them
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		uh  then what happened so we go a little bit further than that uh
 		and i uh uh i was single then later i got married and i had my <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two season</TIMEX> tickets and they were in the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Cotton Bowl</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first row</TIMEX> in the upper deck on the fifty yard line
 		uh which was really nice
 		and uh in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early days</TIMEX> uh you know <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten twelve fourteen thousand</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> i'm talking about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixty</TIMEX> through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about sixty four</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh yeah</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">uh</ENAMEX> was what we got i also bought <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX> tickets to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Texans</ENAMEX> football <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> which is now the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kansas City</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chiefs</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		ah the old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kansas City</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chiefs</ENAMEX> yeah
 	
 	
 		and i and i may have been the only one that did both because the mentality in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> was that you couldn't like both you had to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">like one</NUMEX> and hate the other
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and and it was interesting because the AFL uh when when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chiefs</ENAMEX> when the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Texans</ENAMEX> were playing they would give the scores of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Cowboy games</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFL</ENAMEX> games
 		but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFL</ENAMEX> refused to admit they existed so when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cowboys</ENAMEX> were playing you never got the scores of their games
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		and it you know it was the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lamar Hunt</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX> versus the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Clint Murchison</ENAMEX> crowd
 		and uh and the the popular joke around <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> was that after the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixty two season</TIMEX> uh in fact i went down to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Houston</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixty two</TIMEX> and watched them win the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AFL</ENAMEX> championship
 		uh after the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixty two season</TIMEX> Murchison and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hunt</ENAMEX> got together and flipped a coin and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">loser</ENAMEX> had to stay
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and uh then in uh uh sixty uh uh let's see <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixty nine</TIMEX> when they decided to build the new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stadium</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Irving</ENAMEX>
 		uh they let the uh uh they let the fans build it i mean it wasn't built with any tax <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">payer</ENAMEX> money
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">uh they floated</ENAMEX> bonds that the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that the season</TIMEX> ticket <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holders</ENAMEX> had to buy to maintain their status as season ticket holders
 		so what was neat is you got to choose the tickets based on your seniority as a season ticket holder
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and uh so i had a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> choice
 		and uh i got in the upper tier uh well actually there was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> types of seats there were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two hundred</NUMEX> and fifty dollar bonds and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousand</NUMEX> dollar bonds that you had to buy
 	
 	
 		good grief
 	
 	
 		and so i got the first choice of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two hundred</NUMEX> and fifty dollar bonds so i was in the upper deck in the twelfth row on the fifty yard line
 		i wonder if that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> that's in the eleventh row see he bought <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousand</NUMEX> dollar bonds
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> so uh that happened then uh
 		ultimately i had uh i got transferred overseas by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> i'm with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> and i got transferred overseas
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh through most of the eighties so i each <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</TIMEX> i just sold my tickets i had some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> take custody of my tickets for me i served uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three years four years</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malaysia</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philippines</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		and uh now i got back i got <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> in college and gosh i can't afford that price so i still keep them in my name but the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> who takes them calls me <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every year</TIMEX> and says can i have the tickets <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> more year i say yeah fine take them
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so i still hold them but i don't go
 	
 	
 		oh that's too bad
 	
 	
 		but uh the the funny thing about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cowboys</ENAMEX> is is that everybody is really enthused because we've got all these umpteen jillion draft choices
 		and uh but when you look back on the team uh uh except for probably <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Emmett Smith</ENAMEX> nobody that's been drafted in the last twelve <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> is a starter
 	
 	
 		no i'm kind of uh actually uh i think they've got the draft choices to make to make a good run at it but i i'm not sure how well they'll draft
 	
 	
 		well if you don't make smart selections it doesn't do any good or if you make smart selections and they and you can't sign them
 	
 	
 		yeah they're they're having trouble doing a little bit of both
 	
 	
 		yeah well i heard <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerry Jones</ENAMEX> say something interesting and i and i it must border on legality or ethnicity
 		on draft day he's got about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that are going out to their potential players
 		and when it comes their time to choose they get <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> or so these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> will negotiate with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX> and get them to sign a contract and if they won't sign a contract they won't draft them
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		and and they will take the time allotted to make their choices to do that
 	
 	
 		so you you got <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> to make your decision then
 	
 	
 		and uh uh
 		yeah because see <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> their <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> draft choices were uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alex uh Emmett Smith</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander Wright</ENAMEX> and they didn't get either of them until <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> way through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the season</TIMEX> and they didn't get to go through training <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camp</ENAMEX> with them
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX> came on pretty good <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wright</ENAMEX> was
 	
 	
 		yeah <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX> came on pretty good <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wright</ENAMEX> is is still in the in the potential category
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wright</ENAMEX> didn't do much
 	
 	
 		everybody likes his speed but he can't catch the ball
 	
 	
 		and it doesn't do him much good to run down <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">field</ENAMEX> if he can't catch the ball
 	
 	
 		no no no but but you know that's where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Hayes</ENAMEX> was in his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early days</TIMEX> too
 		so
 	
 	
 		i'll be interested to see how they do of course actually i was in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> in of course i worked for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> too for a while
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		and i left them i guess in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eighty two</NUMEX>
 		but i was in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> there when uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger Staubach</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		all the bunches up there and
 	
 	
 		yeah well those were the glory <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> the seventies were absolutely
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		i got so tired i i guess i just got so tired of hearing about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dallas Cowboys</ENAMEX> and and you know whatever whatever the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cowboys</ENAMEX> did <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that day</TIMEX> that it just kind of turned me against them
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah and <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">and and and</ENAMEX> and the seventies were really a it it saw the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX>'s emergence as a super power coincided with the movement to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Texas Stadium</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> and the movement to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Texas Stadium</ENAMEX> came along about the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX> game of uh of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seventy one season</TIMEX> and that was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> they went to the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Super Bowl</ENAMEX> and beat <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Miami</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		in the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Super Bowl</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the previous year</TIMEX> that they'd finished in the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Cotton Bowl</ENAMEX> they did go to the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Super Bowl</ENAMEX> and got beat by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baltimore</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">in the in the last second</TIMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> but uh i mean in the seventies it was play-offs every year
 	
 	
 		i had some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> of mine well i guess it's it's some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> uh lived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> and of course they're avid you know just avid <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cowboys</ENAMEX> fans
 		and uh they have this uh little mini <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Winnebago</ENAMEX> that they take out there on game day
 	
 	
 		oh yeah there's so many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> do that
 	
 	
 		and uh we used and uh we used to uh my <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> and i used to go out with them all the time because every <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> you know the
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cowboys</ENAMEX> there they had like <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> tickets
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		they they they had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> tickets because their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> were there of course their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> came and went
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh every time the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> didn't go we'd go and we'd go out there and just you know at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">at like ten o'clock in the morning</TIMEX> and set up and there would be all these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> gathered around that you know all the tailgaters and stuff
 		and then everybody would wander into the stadium you know
 	
 	
 		well i own <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> tickets i might i told you i had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> i actually own <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seventy one the year</TIMEX> they moved into the stadium i bought <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> more because i had uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and they were very little
 		and we just ended up taking the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors kids</ENAMEX> who were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teenagers</ENAMEX> because our i thought that ultimately my own would want to go and the way the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stadium</ENAMEX> was selling out in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX> tickets it might be totally sold out which it never did
 		but uh uh at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty nine</TIMEX> dollars a pop now let's see <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six four</TIMEX>'s is uh-huh  that's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred</NUMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixteen</TIMEX> dollars
 	
 	
 		is it that much <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">four hundred dollars</NUMEX> goodness
 		damn
 	
 	
 		and another <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> for parking so that's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred and twenty one</NUMEX> dollars and with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> in college and the potential of having <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> there <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next September</TIMEX> uh i you know i'm going to watch them on television for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few years</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh yeah
 		i would imagine speaking of that what are your <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cowboys</ENAMEX> going to do for backup quarterback
 	
 	
 		uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> they don't have one uh
 	
 	
 		we sure figured out that old <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Babe Wassenberg</ENAMEX> didn't make it
 	
 	
 		yeah they they sure they sure found out in a hurry that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Babe Wassenberg</ENAMEX> wasn't it didn't they
 	
 	
 		yeah he was pretty good staying on the sidelines with his clipboard but he wasn't he wasn't worth a damn in the game
 	
 	
 		yeah but you know it's it's interesting because old uh uh you know everybody said when they signed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Wal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> they're going to have to trade him they're going to have to trade him but you cannot seriously contend uh in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">league</ENAMEX> without <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> front line quarterbacks
 	
 	
 		you know
 	
 	
 		and and and you know the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> that we were good we had <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Staubach</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morton</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		are you up there too
 	
 	
 		now the one that wasn't playing the one that wasn't playing was pissed off most of the time but nevertheless in in over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three or four seasons</TIMEX> both those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> went down with with severe injuries and the other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> stepped in and they didn't never lost a lick
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		but they were still bet your money paid if somebody sent me you know i i guess being an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">athlete</ENAMEX> of course i played in high school and college
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i can understand you know wanting to play but of course as i get more seniority on earth
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		i kind of wonder you know gosh if i could sit on the bench and earn <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">five hundred thousand dollars</NUMEX> a year i'd just be happy to sit there
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah and uh that last championship they won in the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Super Bowl</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Craig Martin</ENAMEX> was the only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> in the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">squad</ENAMEX> that did not get in the game but he got his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">winner</ENAMEX>'s share
