 		i'm very much in favor of gun control
 	
 	
 		oh you are
 	
 	
 		yes i am
 	
 	
 		well this should be very interesting because i'm against it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i don't i don't mind <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> owning <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX> i just think it should be a little you know a little a little more regulated
 	
 	
 		well you know uh now here here's something that uh first occurred to me when they started having all these problems with these automatic uh weapons
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> now there always has been a federal law against fully automatic weapons
 	
 	
 		i believe that's correct uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and yet their uh the gun control <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enthusiasts</ENAMEX> are are uh preaching about the gun control and how they should be have we should have stronger laws and what not
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i don't understand why we don't enforce the laws we have
 	
 	
 		that would certainly help i'm sure
 	
 	
 		now this is not just a state law this is a federal law controlled by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury Department</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yep
 	
 	
 		uh for fully automatic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX> and uh all right now for instance in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> where they passed the uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh semi automatic or or uh now what was it they called them
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		the military version attack <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX> or something
 	
 	
 		yeah right uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh
 		how how is that going to affect the uh sports <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX> i mean <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">rifles</ENAMEX> that are automatic or semi automatic
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yep i really don't have any problem <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack</ENAMEX> with you know uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> using firearms for sporting purposes i don't have any problem the only thing i i am in favor of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven day</TIMEX> waiting period i would like to see that see that happen
 		i
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well now uh i've got to admit i'm inclined to agree with you there
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh even though i am a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NRA</ENAMEX> and they are against they their reason being that well if you let one little law get through pretty soon one's going to stack up on top of another and so forth and so on
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		right
 		yeah i understand that
 	
 	
 		and you've got to admit that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> does kind of look at things that way
 	
 	
 		um-hum that's true i i like i say i don't have any problem with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> using firearms you know for sporting purposes or hunting purposes i just think it's just may be a little too easy you know to acquire one
 		on on a whim of some sort
 	
 	
 		uh that that's true uh now did you hear about the the control that they have up in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i'm not sure i have
 	
 	
 		uh it it's it's a little hard to believe but they can uh
 		of course like just like just about every other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">union</ENAMEX> they have a felony law anyone ever convicted of a a felony is cannot purchase a weapon
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and they don't have a waiting period
 		because they have access to computer records
 		concerning all these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">felons</ENAMEX> and the uh when you go in and buy a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapon</ENAMEX> or a handgun in uh uh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">salesman</ENAMEX> just calls some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">number</ENAMEX> and uh punches in your name
 		and if it comes up negative okay fine and you get your gun your gun right then and there
 	
 	
 		i see
 	
 	
 		uh but they are the only <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> that does it
 	
 	
 		hm that's interesting
 	
 	
 		and uh according to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX> it didn't cost all that much
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and frankly i i don't understand why a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> doesn't have those records available anyway uh uh at least
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah you would think they would
 	
 	
 		uh records of of uh known <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">felons</ENAMEX>  which are available to local police departments
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah right
 		yeah i'm surprised that more <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> doesn't do that
 	
 	
 		uh uh uh certainly those those records are available and all they would have to do is expand it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah right
 	
 	
 		to uh uh <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">well</ENAMEX> connect them into a modem somehow
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		i wouldn't think it'd be that difficult to do
 	
 	
 		well <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX> is not a particularly rich state and they managed to find squeak out a few bucks to do it
 	
 	
 		yep right
 	
 	
 		and uh it's uh uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one hundred</NUMEX> percent successful
 	
 	
 		hm that's interesting
 	
 	
 		yeah i just heard about this <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX> uh they were bragging about it with uh uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		they should have have pride in this because it's it's a good system and it's working well
 	
 	
 		absolutely yeah i agree
 	
 	
 		and they don't need that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven day</TIMEX> waiting period
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		because the whole idea of that waiting period was so that uh it uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> could check up on you
 	
 	
 		yep
 	
 	
 		well you know what's going to happen there those files are going to back up on somebody's desk
 		just a that typical bureaucratic work
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		that's another
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh uh</ENAMEX> thorn in my side bureaucratics
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah right i agree yep right
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i was just thinking there's
 	
 	
 		so anyway well we seem to be one in favor and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> against
 	
 	
 		yeah i guess that's about right
 	
 	
 		although neither one of us are are uh really uh uh dyed in the wool
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh we but we both
 	
 	
 		uh yeah i'm not totally rigid on the subject i just think there should be you know shouldn't be quite so easy to do
 	
 	
 		well there should be some way of checking now here in in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> uh all you need is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">driver</ENAMEX>'s license
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		right um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh even <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">felons</ENAMEX> can still get a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">driver</ENAMEX>'s license
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		so i i don't think they are too
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well they're not rigid enough here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true
 	
 	
 		but don't tell the NRA i said that
 	
 	
 		i won't i promise i won't  okay i promise
 	
 	
 		they're liable to tear up my membership
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you say you retired <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> ago
 	
 	
 		yes i did uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i'm looking forward to it in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about a just just over a year</TIMEX> myself
