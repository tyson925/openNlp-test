 
     		
 	
 		
 
 		probably uh the lifestyles and the size of the area we live in and an age can make a very difference in how credit cards are used um
 		at this point in life i do not carry a credit card that i have to pay a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">service</ENAMEX> charge on
 	
 	
 		uh-huh none at all huh
 	
 	
 		right uh we used to have <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Express</ENAMEX> and uh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Visa</ENAMEX> that of course there's a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yearly</TIMEX> fee on
 	
 	
 		i see yeah has it
 	
 	
 		and we got rid of those we now have <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Discover</ENAMEX> we have a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Visa</ENAMEX> that does not have a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yearly</TIMEX> fee and then
 		we have a card that our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX> put out on a promotion <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> that uh of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first year</TIMEX> there is no <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yearly</TIMEX> fee and of course we don't plan on keeping it the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> year
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah that
 	
 	
 		because i'm pretty frugal about things like that
 	
 	
 		that's what we we got rid of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Express</ENAMEX> card for the same reason is though we have a a credit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">union</ENAMEX> and we get our cards our other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MasterCards</ENAMEX> for free so we don't have to pay a a fee at all
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and that's what i i know <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who don't have any credit cards at all and i'm always amazed  because i don't know how they can get by without them it doesn't seem like you can do anything anymore without a credit card
 	
 	
 		we find it especially useful because my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> retired <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">over a year ago</TIMEX> and we travel quite a bit and we we like to leave a credit card when we check into a motel in case we want to make a phone call or
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		whatever which we do pretty often and and uh fact in a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">motels</ENAMEX> we noticed from our most recent trip they that you do not even get the telephone turned on in your <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> unless you've left a credit card at the desk
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so i suppose for that reason we will always have a credit card of some kind but
 	
 	
 		yeah i like them  too with with us we've got insurance of course but due to my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>'s work but by the time like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks ago</TIMEX> we all got sick <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all four</NUMEX> us and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX> had to go to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> twice
 		and then all the other the the rest of us did and he was like <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">six hundred dollars</NUMEX> yeah and it was we were we all had it was a viral <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pneumonia</ENAMEX> it was really bad and and we were just horribly sick but i mean <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">six hundred dollars</NUMEX> i can't come up with
 	
 	
 		oh my
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		can you do that on a credit card
 	
 	
 		yeah all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> here will take a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Visa</ENAMEX> so that and you know and go to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KMart</ENAMEX> and use the pharmacy to pay for the uh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicines</ENAMEX> and then turn it all into the insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> and wait for it to come back
 	
 	
 		oh for heaven sakes
 		for the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know and so our part of it was still <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">twenty percent</NUMEX> but twenty percent i can payoff in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one month</TIMEX> whereas you know then i got to wait for the rest the rest of it to come back from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aetna</ENAMEX> but it basically floats
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know during the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the time</TIMEX> because we've got a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty day</TIMEX> grace period on the credit card as long as you pay it you know within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that time</TIMEX> and that's usually enough time for the insurance to get back
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i try to make that our biggest use of credit cards i know <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who are so in debt <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Visa</ENAMEX> cards i can't believe you know it's like why did you go get they charged up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> so then they but they were still paying their minimum so their credit rating was still good
 	
 	
 		uh yes
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and and you would you know they get this in the mail say oh well we can't use that one anymore we'll just get another <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> and that's like who you
 	
 	
 		i have a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girlfriend</ENAMEX> who has one that her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> doesn't know she has now uh she must rent a p post office <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">box</ENAMEX> or something or i mean she couldn't beat him to the mail <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every month</TIMEX> i wouldn't think
 	
 	
 		oh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		because they both work and they uh he's a fireman so he's home <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two days a week</TIMEX> that she teaches and would not be there so i don't know how she manages it but she keeps that a secret and i would not want to pay her <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		interest rate on the thing it just has to be awful because it
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		but that's
 		that's a good way to make a big problem in your marriage real quick gosh that's just dishonest
 	
 	
 		oh oh i would think so but they've been married almost <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty five years</TIMEX> so i think they've done things like that to each other for a long time
 	
 	
 		oh well  maybe maybe they'll be all right i know in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mine</ENAMEX> if i did something like that and then my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> found out jeez he would just
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		be well i i think i would feel the same way i'd i'd really feel like i'd been deceived you know that that wasn't the thing to do
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yes yes
 		well many many many <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many years ago</TIMEX> uh i bought wallpaper we have a large kitchen
 		uh dining <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen</ENAMEX> family <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> combination and i wanted to paper it  and i bought wallpaper from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sears</ENAMEX> catalog on my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sears</ENAMEX> card and at that time i was only able to pay <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about ten</NUMEX> dollars a month
 		which meant i was taking <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about eight dollars</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a month</TIMEX> off
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		the balance by the time they got their interest out of it and it took forever to pay it off and at that point i promised myself i would never pay interest on a credit card again so that's kind of been my motto
 	
 	
 		um
 		yeah we've tried to do that we've paid ours off you know all the way down to where we had everything down to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> and especially right before i i quit work <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years ago</TIMEX> to stay home with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and right and before i left we had everything paid off we were in great shape we were putting money you know because we were both working we were finally putting money in
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but we've gone back the other way to some extent because because just because there are times when you just can't pay it all
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		because there are just too many bills
 	
 	
 		well as you say when you're taking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> too it does make a difference our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> are matured out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> and uh our needs are much different than they were
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh when we were raising a family i think back then we just now we feel like we might could live without <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> but uh we have a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Discover</ENAMEX> card and i have to laugh about the cash back do you have one of those
 	
 	
 		oh isn't that silly i i sent that one back because we had used it for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> and we had used a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">thousand dollars</NUMEX> worth during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> and what we and and i think we got back <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">fifty cents</NUMEX> or something it was like please what is this this is and the interest on it was was eighteen or nineteen percent
 	
 	
 		did you
 		yeah yeah
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Visa</ENAMEX> card was we could get through our credit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">union</ENAMEX> was like <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fourteen</NUMEX> percent so we just we sent it back we
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		we keep gas credit cards and we have <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Visa</ENAMEX> and then i have started my own business i have a photography <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX> and i went ahead and got a separate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Visa</ENAMEX> just for that photography <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX> because there are things that i have to buy
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and with my photography when i when i take things to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lab</ENAMEX> to get developed it's <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">several hundred dollars</NUMEX> at a time and i was using up all of our personal credit
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		with my photography <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX> even though again it's paying off <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every month</TIMEX> because i'm i'm putting everything
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i'm i'm uh you know i'm getting the pictures and i'm taking them back to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> i already have their money but i wasn't depositing them until i gave them the pictures back
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		another practice i found i'm going to have to stop hot checks  you wouldn't think for a for a twelve dollar school picture that uh that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> would write a hot check but they do
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh i see oh dear  well
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		i think those are the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who have their credit cards uh charged up to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">max</ENAMEX> and that's just a way of life i guess
 	
 	
 		i guess
 		it's just you know and when i think about that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX> this this particular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX> who wrote me a check for twelve dollars and it bounced and i sent it through you know sent it through the check through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX> once and she incurred at least a fifteen dollar fee
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		for a returned check so now she's already doubled the price of her check and i've s ent it through a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> time because they said there's money in the account now
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know and and if it doesn't go through the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> time that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>'s out <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> bucks
 	
 	
 		for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> twelve dollar check it's never quite made sense to me but then uh
 	
 	
 		for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> twelve dollar check
 	
 	
 		when my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> was in business he had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer</ENAMEX> who said that he had to use credit cards because he spent more than he made <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every month</TIMEX> and he was perfectly serious about it
 	
 	
 		gosh
 	
 	
 		so i  don't know why he you know didn't go ahead and project to the fact that eventually that was going to catch up with him but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		he's going to have a debt going out the ear
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		i was very glad my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> retired and got away from that kind of thing  so we've we have a little problem with our <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> card we're uh we've always used a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mobile</ENAMEX> card because he was affiliated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mobile Oil</ENAMEX> and uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		we it's very difficult to find their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stations</ENAMEX> so i guess that's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> reason why we use uh we've used <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Discover</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Visa</ENAMEX> quite a bit for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fuel</ENAMEX> even
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 		well we have a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mobile</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stations</ENAMEX> around here and i used to use that card almost exclusively but now they're charging the extra <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">five cents</NUMEX> to use your credit card and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texaco</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chevron</ENAMEX> and somebody else
 		is not anymore they'll take it you know at the cash price or you they'll now let you write a check if you have their card so you pay for it immediately instead of um you know putting it off for a month
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		i thought that was illegal
 	
 	
 		what's that writing a check for gas
 	
 	
 		no no no to uh put a surcharge on a credit card
 		of
 	
 	
 		well all of them down down here you had a cash price for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gasoline</ENAMEX> and a credit card price
 	
 	
 		oh so what they're doing they're discounting for cash is the way they're because i think it is illegal to add a surcharge so
 	
 	
 		right that's that's supposedly
 	
 	
 		that's that they're looking at it differently it amounts to that you have to pay extra if you use your credit card but
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		right and and they've changed that now now  stop it go play and leave me alone
 		yeah and so i'm using the other ones now because they're just as easy to get to and then they're nickel a gallon cheaper so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		so what we're saying is that we use a credit card when it uh is convenient but if it's going to cost us money we don't though
 	
 	
 		yes
 		we try not to we're probably the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> the bank the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX> don't want to hear from us because they want those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who charge it up to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten thousand</NUMEX> dollars uh and then get all yeah and then pay fifty dollars <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a month</TIMEX> and it all goes to interest
 	
 	
 		probably
 		
 
 		and leave us
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 	
 	
 		oh i guess they must they must make a ton  there's not too many places you can make eighteen <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">percent</NUMEX> interest on things anymore
 	
 	
 		that's right that's right
 	
 	
 		that's what we need see you and i need to get in the credit card business we need to start our own credit card  if you can yeah because you sure can't get that interest anyway else gosh
 	
 	
 		i guess so  that would be wonderful wouldn't it
 		huh-uh huh-uh not on those CD's we're trying to live on  uh yeah
 	
 	
 		oh yeah ours are like <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> percent we've got <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> and with with IRA stuff in it and uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		jeez you can't get any interest rates
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX> have just retired just in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last couple of months</TIMEX> my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> has and uh they're trying to figure out you know what they're doing with stuff and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mom</ENAMEX>'s in there cutting up the credit cards  you know can't use these anymore and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		sure sure yeah well like i say the only reason we do in fact i when my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> and i were
