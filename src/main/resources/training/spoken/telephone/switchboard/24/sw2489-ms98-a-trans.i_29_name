 
     		
 	
 		
 
 		well what's uh what's the best experience you can come up with uh as far as camping
 	
 	
 		oh gee the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> one that comes to my mind is uh
 		camping outside the river at the uh at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Braunfels</ENAMEX> there
 	
 	
 		oh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> that sounds like a blast
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah we've gone down there many a year
 	
 	
 		is that right
 	
 	
 		camping
 		riding the river rapids
 	
 	
 		yeah that that's where you just float down the river right
 	
 	
 		yeah well they have some you know <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> way decent rapids there
 	
 	
 		on tubes an
 		i see
 	
 	
 		it's not Deliverance but it's pretty good
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well that sounds pretty neat
 		i guess i guess for me um um
 		probably the last time i went camping was uh back in high school with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boy Scouts</ENAMEX> we always took an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> trip up to uh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colorado</ENAMEX> and went fly fishing
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		and uh we had we had a blast up there
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i never tried that
 	
 	
 		it it was nice going up there and see that scenery
 	
 	
 		well i uh we've done quite a bit of camping we uh used to uh
 		throw everything in we had some old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Volkswagen</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">buses</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">our years early days</TIMEX> when we had <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> and they uh
 		we'd uh
 		you know go uh drive up into the hill <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> around uh
 		oh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Braunfels</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		i see
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">San Marcus</ENAMEX> around in through there
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Austin</ENAMEX> up around <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Austin</ENAMEX> area
 	
 	
 		i see
 	
 	
 		just camp out
 	
 	
 		did they have some pretty good campsites up there
 	
 	
 		yeah uh usually we'd go uh like the state <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX> a lot of the state <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX> up in through there
 	
 	
 		i see
 	
 	
 		there's quite a few of them up there uh We started off pretty rough you know pretty much roughing it and we had like i say the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Volkswagen</ENAMEX> bus we'd pull up and just
 		i had fixed up the thing where you could just open up the doors i'd hooked on a little extension and
 		made a tarp for  the side and and
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and uh then we were set up in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about five minutes ten minutes</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		that was a regular party machine huh
 	
 	
 		out by the side of the river
 		yeah
 		then we uh later on we started using a tent when we'd go to uh you know tent camping
 	
 	
 		i see that sounds pretty neat
 	
 	
 		we enjoyed it uh we had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> and uh
 		they've done a lot of camping with us and
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		they just seemed to like it
 	
 	
 		yeah i remember uh going with my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> uh we weren't very good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">campers</ENAMEX> it seemed like we were never prepared and uh we
 		i grew up right around <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amarillo</ENAMEX> up in the very northern part of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh we had a couple of lakes out there that we'd go and and go fishing and then camp out and uh seemed like it always rain or something you know something had to go wrong and uh we were never prepared for it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ha</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so uh it wasn't it wasn't until <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boy Scouts</ENAMEX> that i really started enjoying uh going out and camping
 	
 	
 		pretty uh pretty rough up around <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amarillo</ENAMEX> isn't it
 	
 	
 		it sure is uh in fact we went up there for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Easter</ENAMEX> and and we we had uh a beautiful day we had a day where it snowed and then uh it rained <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next day</TIMEX> and you know you just never can tell what the weather's going to do
 	
 	
 		that's my uh one of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>'s favorite stories to tell about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Easter</ENAMEX> camping trips it the coldest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Easter</ENAMEX> ever
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		we left here uh we left here it was shorts weather in uh on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Easter</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		we went up and
 		were going to spend on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Blanco River</ENAMEX>
 		and we got there and a front come through and it was  it was freezing
 	
 	
 		oh Lord
 		
 
 	
 	
 		we didn't of course weren't prepared for it so
 	
 	
 		right
 		oh and there's nothing worse when you're out camping if you get wet
 		you know it
 	
 	
 		we sat there my brother-in-law cooked chicken bless and he was don't know how in heck he managed to do it but he did he stood out there and cooked that and we had something hot to eat
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that's hilarious
 	
 	
 		we got up <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the next morning</TIMEX> and she said i don't know about you
 		but she said i'm going into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> and we're going to buy some long johns
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i'm surprised you didn't just pack up and go home i tell
 	
 	
 		so i was ready
 		i was ready to go back to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Houston</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		that's right that's right oh Lord i guess everybody's got those experiences when uh when things just didn't didn't go right for them
 	
 	
 		yeah that's uh
 		sometimes turns into fun i think another similar one was when we'd go uh
 		up to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Bastrop Strate State Park</ENAMEX> there in uh
 		kind of got caught by the cold weather and
 		we uh gathered what firewood we could and built us a campfire you know and sat around there
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		into <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the wee hours</TIMEX> and uh ran out of firewood
 		so we uh each took turns going out and gathering up big bundles of pine needles and throwing them on the fire and they didn't last very long but they burned hot
 	
 	
 		oh Lord
 		oh Lord
 	
 	
 		i remember that that was a lot of fun
 	
 	
 		that is funny but
 	
 	
 		we uh most recently we still go camping every well not as much anymore we our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> are pretty near grown and uh
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		i uh we had uh we've used a tent you know pop up trailer
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		we've done some camping in that we still go down to the river at least try to get down there once a year
 	
 	
 		i see
 	
 	
 		Braunfels
 	
 	
 		do they have uh actual <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camp sites</ENAMEX> there where you can go and
 	
 	
 		yeah uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i see
 	
 	
 		they're some
 		they're some they're some what you'd call primitive i mean there are no uh
 		real  <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> and then others that have uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">facilities</ENAMEX> or yeah
 	
 	
 		there's a few that have hot and cold uh you know electricity and and hot water and so forth
 		there's a few of those and you have to make your reservations pretty well in advance
 	
 	
 		oh you do have to make reservations there
 	
 	
 		yeah because it's you know it is so nice and there limited space so
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		right
 	
 	
 		we usually if we're going we usually try and make them by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX> or so anyway
 	
 	
 		oh i see
 		huh i didn't realize that
 	
 	
 		so
 		it's uh yeah it's uh pretty nice
 	
 	
 		since it's so popular it's best to to have the
 		reservations huh
 	
 	
 		well if you want to get a good <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camp site</ENAMEX> yeah you can go down and get a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camp site pretty</ENAMEX> near <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">any weekend</TIMEX> they get prett y crowded on the uh you know the main <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July Fourth of July</TIMEX> and
 	
 	
 		right
 		right <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Memorial Day</ENAMEX> and whatever
 	
 	
 		yeah and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Labor Day</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> can get pretty cold though  if you go too early
 	
 	
 		oh is that right
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		when's the best time to go down there for the water
 	
 	
 		we try not to go before uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July</TIMEX> because uh it takes uh
 	
 	
 		it takes that long to get it heat up
 	
 	
 		gets warmed up yeah it comes out of the
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canyon Lake</ENAMEX> up there and it's uh
 		
 
 		comes out of that deep lake and it's pretty cold <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> you know
