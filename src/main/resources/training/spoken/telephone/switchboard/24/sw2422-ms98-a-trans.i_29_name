 
     		
 	
 		okay are are you an exercise fanatic
 	
 	
 		are you
 		well i'm sort of an exercise fanatic i'm big on swimming
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		well that's way north too i guess you have to swim inside huh
 	
 	
 		yeah i uh i i i find i do more swimming in the wintertime than i do in the summer
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		uh my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> has a sailboat so i wind up on the sailboat a lot in the summertime
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but it's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the winter months</TIMEX> that i can get serious about swimming
 	
 	
 		oh well that's good that's that's one of the best ones i understand no stress on the joints
 	
 	
 		well it winds up being a little stress on the shoulder <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">joints</ENAMEX> after a while
 	
 	
 		yeah i guess so but as far as the weight bearing
 	
 	
 		yeah well i find that uh if i want to lose some weight that uh i can't do it unless i exercise as well
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true plus even if you lose weight and don't exercise it ends up just looking you know looking unhealthy
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> i had a campaign to lose about uh <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty</TIMEX> pounds
 		and uh i wound up swimming <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about three hundred and sixty</NUMEX> miles during the year
 	
 	
 		wow
 		do you swim like at a at a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Y</NUMEX> or
 	
 	
 		yes uh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fairfax County</ENAMEX> has uh a number of uh park authority uh recreation centers
 		and all of them have uh at least a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty five meter or twenty five</TIMEX> yard uh swimming pool
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and in fact out here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oakton</ENAMEX> we have uh there's <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a fifty meter</NUMEX> uh pool called Oakmar
 		and it's sort of a uh
 		uh a landmark pool it's a very uh excellent design
 		you know top rated pool
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		and good uh <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">gallery facilities</ENAMEX> for competitive uh events and things like that
 	
 	
 		really
 		is it like <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Olympic</ENAMEX> size
 	
 	
 		it's <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Olympic</ENAMEX> size yes
 	
 	
 		wow
 		are you are you a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> employee
 	
 	
 		no i uh work for E-Systems
 	
 	
 		what
 	
 	
 		which is which is another <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> company
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but i'm at the uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Melpar</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX> here in uh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Falls Church</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well the reason i ask you i i'm a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX> and uh we have a fitness center you know that's on site
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		that makes it real real convenient
 		because i tend to find that once i get <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> that's it you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i tend to not want to go anywhere after that but this way you know you can go to the fitness center right from work and they have aerobics and you know all this machines and
 		all that sort of stuff we're not we're not high rollers like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> we don't have a pool but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah well i have we have a uh recreation <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> which is almost right across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> from our uh office
 	
 	
 		oh that's good
 	
 	
 		and so i hit there at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">seven o'clock in the morning</TIMEX>
 		get in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a half hour</TIMEX> swim and still make it to work on time
 	
 	
 		oh that's great
 		yeah <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> is usually a better time to exercise but i usually find that after work is when i have the time to do it
 	
 	
 		um well i get to put work after work i i have to hurry <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> and uh and help out with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		you have honeydews
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		fix things around the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and all those kind of chores
 	
 	
 		honeydews
 	
 	
 		so <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning hour</TIMEX> is my time to myself
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well that's great i i like to to work out some in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX> but it's not like  you know i usually use the video or
 		something like that
 		to do
 	
 	
 		oh you
 	
 	
 		plus i like to dance you know
 	
 	
 		oh you do the aerobic uh dancing then
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum and and on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturdays</TIMEX> i go to a jazzercise class that's my
 	
 	
 		yeah well that looks that looks like so much work to me i
 	
 	
 		oh it's fun jazzercise is really fun
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		but you put out a lot of energy uh keeping up that pace
 	
 	
 		yeah there there's a lot of energy i i i like to belly dance too but there's not the same you know you don't get the aerobic
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		workout as much
 		but jazzercise is what it's it's so much fun that you forget you're exercising you know aerobics you don't forget
 	
 	
 		hum
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know you're exercising oh and we started the bench aerobics too
 		i don't know if you've seen that
 	
 	
 		i haven't seen that no
 	
 	
 		that's a fairly new thing it's just like uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> step
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know it's like a box and you just step up and down and up and down and up down do different
 		variations you know change feet and
 		and you'd be surprised how quick that gets the pulse rate up
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		it's a it's a lot quicker and and that way it's completely low impact here's no jumping or
 		you know no jarring on the knee bones
 	
 	
 		yeah i i see some of these exercise machines that uh it looks like you're constantly walking up stairs
 	
 	
 		yeah uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh i think that should get your heart rate right up there at the maximum and keep it there
 	
 	
 		yeah that will do it yeah we have one of those too but it's boring
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i can see that well i a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> complain about swimming that that's uh boring
 	
 	
 		oh but that wouldn't be boring like walking up stairs
 	
 	
 		but i find that uh
 		over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">over the years</TIMEX> i've developed the ability to keep track of my uh workout
 		and at the same time uh do some creative thinking while i'm swimming
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so i i can write letters to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">congressman</ENAMEX> and uh organize reports and uh
 	
 	
 		right
 		well do you count your laps or do you just have a time <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> that you
 	
 	
 		i i count them i i swim a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixteen fifty every day</TIMEX>
 		and uh so that's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixty six</TIMEX> lengths of the pool
 	
 	
 		jeez
 	
 	
 		and uh i sometimes i may not be conscious of keeping count but uh
 		you know every <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">now and then</TIMEX> when i do check up and say where is my count i check it relative to the clock and
 		and i also wind up coming out even  even side of the pool
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		well that's neat do you do you look forward to doing it or do you sometimes have to force yourself until you get started
 	
 	
 		i usually uh  look forward to it uh
 		and in fact some <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">mornings</TIMEX> i uh almost feel a necessity
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		to uh to get out and uh go for the swim i think uh there is something to this endorphins
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh thing but uh when i'm exercising regularly i i feel the need to to do more exercise
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		and then when you don't for some reason you feel real lethargic
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it seems like  like the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the the less</TIMEX> you exercise the tireder you are i'm sorry
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah that's true sometimes i find i have to kick myself though to get started and once i get started you know it's it feels good
 	
 	
 		and
 		yeah well sometimes sometimes uh i've had the effect that if i swim in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX>
 		uh i get an urge to go back and swim again at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">lunch time</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		wow do you have time to do that in your job
 	
 	
 		and
 		just barely
 		it amounts to running out the back door and uh heading for the pool jumping in swimming some sprints or something like that and then running back again
 	
 	
 		course you probably i have i have waist length hair so you probably don't have that problem
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 		you know that's a problem with with getting getting that much wet
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but
 	
 	
 		well i've i've lost most of my hair so that's no real problem
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		then nobody really complains if i uh if i come in
 		sort of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> wet
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well gee well that sounds neat and you do that like like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">almost every day</TIMEX> or what about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekends</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		almost <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX> i uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this spring</TIMEX> has been uh a little hard to keep up the pace because uh we've had a lot of family activities my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> has taken up skiing
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and uh she she twisted
 	
 	
 		water skiing or snow skiing
 	
 	
 		snow skiing she did water skiing when she was uh young
 	
 	
 		oh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh i think she was uh pretty competitive at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> point she had a bad accident that uh put her out of competition
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		uh but she's taking up snow skiing and she got me involved
 	
 	
 		oh that's good exercise
 	
 	
 		so i was out there you know stark terror coming down the side of the hill
 	
 	
 		God really
 	
 	
 		and we had another expedition where we took the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> up and uh taught them to ski
 	
 	
 		how how old are your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> are they
 	
 	
 		and
 		uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven eight</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh that's a good age to start something like that
 	
 	
 		yeah it was it was delightful watching them uh learn they uh they went out with their individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personalities</ENAMEX> and picked it up in their own little way
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh the one we thought would be the most timid
 		uh turned out to be the one that stuck with it and was the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> to learn
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		and the other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> got jealous and they went out and says well i'm going to go and do it too so  so they learned too
 	
 	
 		little competition there
 	
 	
 		and uh we went to a good <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">instructors</ENAMEX> were there uh took a liking to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> so next thing you know they're they've got the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> off on the uh some of the bigger slopes
 	
 	
 		really did they have a separate uh like class or something for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> or is it everybody together
 	
 	
 		the place where we went has a separate area for beginners it's called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sun Bowl</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and they just put <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">instructors</ENAMEX> out there
 		and you you sign up for instruction and they just give you an arm band
 		and if you see an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">instructor</ENAMEX> who's not doing anything you just tap him on the shoulder and ask him questions and they'll show you things
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and so they're pretty much available <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all day</TIMEX> long
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and you can either take instruction or practice or or just enjoy yourself whatever you like
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">instructors</ENAMEX> are very enthusiastic and of course they picked up the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> and and took them on some of the more advanced slopes
 	
 	
 		yeah did you all start <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year or last year</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh yes my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> did some last year
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and got started and so she grabbed me by the ear and made me do it this year
 	
 	
 		
 
 		do you all have have you had a good snow this year
 	
 	
 		we were lucky um
 		we were going to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Seven Springs</ENAMEX> up in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time we went up there the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">instructor</ENAMEX> said that was the first uh really good <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekend</TIMEX> that they'd had this year
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		and uh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Charlotte</ENAMEX> went up in the uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">middle of the season</TIMEX>
