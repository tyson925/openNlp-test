 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well i don't know but uh i'm <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty two years old</TIMEX> and i think it would be uh it's not a good choice to do that i mean you have uh
 		everything here you know like uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Army</ENAMEX> and everything else is all all voluntary and that's the way you're going to dedicate yourself
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		to to that you know to your job if it's voluntary i mean if you don't like it i mean if you're like in other places where they have a you know mandatory you know uh services yeah
 	
 	
 		sort of like the draft do you know in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Army</ENAMEX> you're not going to uh uh be i i understand i understand what you're saying i'm i'm <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty four</TIMEX> and uh
 		you know i i don't think that i would be willing to to dedicate you know <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year or two years</TIMEX> of my life
 	
 	
 		because i mean the thing is is that whenever you i mean you seen like for example you know like the war that just went on you saw you saw that
 	
 	
 		to a
 		right
 	
 	
 		some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> were not going you know <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that that had all the benefits that were sitting around for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> you know maybe <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three four years</TIMEX> getting paid uh by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> or you know
 	
 	
 		right
 		exactly
 	
 	
 		they just when the when the time came they said no way you know when they when that was their job they joined it because they wanted to or well you know some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> didn't
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		didn't have the you know the money they said it's a good way of uh in coming in but those are public service i mean you i mean you would be getting paid very little you know or anything at all
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and uh you would just hate it so much that whatever you had to do
 		would be just you know it's like you know
 	
 	
 		you just do the minimum yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah i mean you wouldn't you wouldn't do it i mean  the the the thing would be that it would throw you you know totally the wrong way you would be there because you had to be there
 	
 	
 		right
 		exactly
 	
 	
 		but yet you would still respond to everything in a very you know negative way you know it's like do this why you know
 	
 	
 		right
 		right right
 	
 	
 		i i have a i don't i don't have to do anything you know it's like what am i going to do if i sit here if i sit here for a whole year they'll let me go and then i can get back to my life
 	
 	
 		
 
 		exactly
 		you know and i and i'm sure there is a problem about uh getting you know the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">volunteers</ENAMEX> to do that and maybe they could uh spend a little bit more money on promotion and and uh advertise it a little bit more
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh so that the public is a little more aware of it but uh i definitely agree with you i would hate to to see that become mandatory
 	
 	
 		well there i don't think there's any way it can you know like they say this proposal would anywhere would get anywhere because of the i mean <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of all i've never heard of it until <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this this</TIMEX> phone call you know
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and uh if it is actually proposed and taken you know to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> or something
 	
 	
 		that would be political suicide for anybody to i would think
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		to to actually support it you know it would be just like saying that you know what are what are you crazy i mean there
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 	
 	
 		i mean you i mean you know we had enough with the abortion issue that's still going around that you <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> want to bring you know the next  you know
 	
 	
 		exactly
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next big issue</TIMEX> up yeah yeah because i think uh  young and old alike uh would would more or less agree on this issue
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh maybe certain religions uh you know i think it's
 		is it the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mormons</ENAMEX> or somebody i know at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brigham Young University</ENAMEX> they have to do like a mandatory uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year or two years</TIMEX> worth of sort of service
 		but uh whatever that religion is
 	
 	
 		but see but you're going there and you know what you're getting into
 	
 	
 		that's right and that is a that is a definite choice uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and and i i believe it's just that religion that's not a you know a prominent uh predominant religion uh religion so i don't i don't think that that uh issue would hold much water
 	
 	
 		yeah but it's it's not like saying like i'm born and then when i reached a certain age i'm going to have to do something you know
 	
 	
 		in a political
 		right
 	
 	
 		it's uh it's not by choice it's like everything everything else you know it's like if i want to do it i'll do it but you know it's like you know and uh you know i have a background i'm from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Argentina</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and uh everybody everybody that is unlucky enough has to do the military service
 	
 	
 		i see
 	
 	
 		and but you go into this whole big lottery <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every year</TIMEX> and you know each uh your last <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> digits of your document you know like your social security number you're matched up with other numbers right
 	
 	
 		oh i see
 	
 	
 		from uh from uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a thousand</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and so if your number is below <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four hundred</NUMEX> you're not going to have to do it
 	
 	
 		i see
 	
 	
 		say it's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between four hundred and six hundred</NUMEX> you might have to do it depending how many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are in your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> and you know like you the they right
 	
 	
 		your age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> or whatever yeah
 	
 	
 		and if it's above <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six hundred</NUMEX> you're going to have to do it and i got <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty one</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh Lord
 		oh okay so you felt pretty good then huh
 	
 	
 		and so yeah i i didn't have to do it but the thing was that you have you know the whole the whole <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s watching you know like if if it's your class everybody that's your same age is listening listening to the radio
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		waiting for them to announce the number you know
 	
 	
 		golly
 	
 	
 		and it's like and then you know you have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> you know going you know it's like everywhere you know you have some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that are glad some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that are saying shit and the other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that are going oh my God i'm somewhere in the middle you know it's like wow am i going to have to do it
 	
 	
 		right yeah right there on the borderline huh
 	
 	
 		yeah and you know but it's  my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> goes everybody in my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> had to do it and they go
 		you know it's just <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a half</NUMEX> of your life that's that's totally wasted you don't do anything else there's no time and you don't do anything
 	
 	
 		jeez
 	
 	
 		you know you go there you train you get treated like shit and then you you i mean then you get out
 	
 	
 		so it's it's no is it not educational training it's strictly it's strictly uh military i see
 	
 	
 		right
 		and so i mean but you know it's like
 		the thing is is that you know you just get treated i mean <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one one</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> that was doing it was uh like uh a waiter at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> that know you know like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">military</ENAMEX> had
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and that was his job you know he got he got you know like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three months</TIMEX> of uh you know physical training
 	
 	
 		God
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and then he got to serve all these people
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know but that's what they do i mean that's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a half</NUMEX> of your life that's that you don't do anything that you have to be there you know maybe <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> times you know <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> times <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a week</TIMEX> and that you know that you have a i guess a round robin schedule or something
 	
 	
 		right
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">jeez</ENAMEX> and i guess a minimal pay or
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		no oh there i don't i don't think i don't think there is any pay wait i'm not sure because what happens is you get to like to ride <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">buses</ENAMEX> for free
 	
 	
 		do you they get paid very well
 		oh
 	
 	
 		well you do i guess you do get paid but the thing is is that you know <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are what if they see you in the uniform
 	
 	
 		oh you get a little benefits
 		oh they know
 	
 	
 		right like for example you you know like when they go around the train asking for tickets like short distant <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trains</ENAMEX> they won't ask you if you if you're wearing your military uniform for a ticket they'll just skip you
 	
 	
 		right
 		i see i see
 	
 	
 		and uh you know it's like they they consider that but it would be the same way here you know it's like if if you had to do it you know you have a big sign i'm sorry i don't get paid you know
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 	
 	
 		it's like please let me ride for free you know it's like i'm i'm living off <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> for these wonderful <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</TIMEX> which i have to do you know it's like
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right
 	
 	
 		and then the other thing is when i get out of college at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty eight</TIMEX> with my BS you know it's like by the time
 	
 	
 		well yeah yeah you're <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty years old</TIMEX> and trying to get your <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> job yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and so that would be that would be see there're too many things that go against it that would be ridiculous
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		so oh well it's been <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">seven minutes</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		well
 		that sounds good
 	
 	
 		i don't i don't well i don't i don't think they'll ever pass this i i i'm just going to laugh if i ever see it in the newspapers i i mean i don't read the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX> that much but i never heard anything about it so
 	
 	
 		well i'm i haven't either and so uh yeah i don't i don't think much will come up of it
 	
 	
 		so
 		and but then you won't have to do it just imagine sometimes your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> you'll be saying well it's your job go do it you know  but it
 	
 	
 		that's right
 		
 
 		that's right it's easier after you're you don't have to worry about it
 	
 	
 		yeah really then you'll have to say see in my age i didn't have to do it  oh really dad yeah  oh well okay
 	
 	
 		that's right that's right
 		well hey i appreciate the call talk to you later bye-bye
 	
 	
 		yeah bye-bye
