 
     		
 	
 		and all right what have you seen
 	
 	
 		okay the latest movie i've seen that i thought was fantastic was <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dances With Wolves</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		that's i knew you were going to say that i wanted i want to go see that
 	
 	
 		oh man
 		i i just finally ended up going to see it uh and  <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX> my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> had the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> and i just went because we couldn't we could never get to go see it together because it's so long by the time we had a  babysitter for that long
 	
 	
 		gosh
 	
 	
 		so i finally just went to see it and i just thought it was fantastic
 	
 	
 		yeah i i i watched uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Costner</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Academy Awards i</ENAMEX> was really happy that he got i was hoping he was going to get <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Best Actor</ENAMEX> uh but he he he did pretty good on that one
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		that was quite a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the buffalo</ENAMEX> scene in that thing was so real it's like  i mean it just blew me away
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i'd i bet
 		yeah there several of them that are out right now that i want to see uh <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dances uh Silence of the Lambs</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh i'm i'm afraid to go see that one that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> looks so scary just from the previews i thought gosh i'd probably have nightmares for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next six months</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		nah nah
 		nah i mean that's what people
 	
 	
 		it's supposed to be good though i know some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> who went to see it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		they said it was really riveting
 	
 	
 		yeah well you know they they that's what they said about <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Exorcist</ENAMEX> you know no no it's terrible you'll have nightmares you know i watched <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last weekend</TIMEX> me and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">roommate</ENAMEX> we we laughed about it
 	
 	
 		well you're not a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirteen year old</TIMEX> i don't know i saw it when i was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX> and i thought oh man
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well i'll tell well i guess i i guess it was because i'd read the book before i saw the movie
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and the book to me was far more frightening than the movie was yeah he's a very good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writer</ENAMEX> and he had a way of putting you in that scene you know it was
 	
 	
 		oh really huh gosh
 		oh boy
 	
 	
 		yeah and of course i was i was living alone at the time and it was <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">late at night</TIMEX> and scary and  you know  you start hearing noises you know
 	
 	
 		oh gosh call the crisis line
 		yeah i bet
 	
 	
 		and there's <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">attic</ENAMEX> you know
 	
 	
 		oh gosh
 	
 	
 		uh let's see there was a couple of others that are out and i can't remember
 	
 	
 		i saw <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> i thought was crummy with that new uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael J Fox</ENAMEX> movie <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Hard Way</ENAMEX> where he plays a a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actor</ENAMEX> that's uh like the huh
 	
 	
 		yeah i i didn't i didn't even like the previews on that
 	
 	
 		oh i know it was well i ended up at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">theater</ENAMEX> and there was didn't seem to be anything else on  i wanted to see so i'll try that but it wasn't worth anything i didn't care for that at all
 	
 	
 		
 
 		no
 		i i don't much care for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael J Fox</ENAMEX> anyway
 	
 	
 		yeah well the last <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> i saw him in one of those Back to the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Future Part Three</ENAMEX> deals and that was crummy also i didn't think that was any good so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i saw the original Back to the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Future</ENAMEX> and then i i know i hardly ever go see a sequel
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i mean i think i think the only i've ever seen a sequel was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Thousand</ENAMEX> and One
 	
 	
 		oh boy
 	
 	
 		uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Thousand</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ten</ENAMEX> was far better
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Thousand</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> was a good movie if you had read the book
 	
 	
 		well i hadn't read it and i couldn't figure what was going on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> the time so
 	
 	
 		yeah no nobody could figure it out i mean the the book was so much uh there's just things all you can do is put it in words you can't put it in pictures and a lot of that stuff that was going on in the film you could say what is this
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know what's the significance of the apes you know
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i should probably go back and read the book now  that i just saw the movie again not too long ago
 	
 	
 		oh the book is really good i mean i i keep a little library of books that i just like to read over and over again and that's one of them it's it's so well written
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">wow huh</ENAMEX>
 		huh
 		huh well i have one i bet you haven't seen if you don't have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Otis</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milo</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh you're right i haven't
 	
 	
 		oh that is that is the most precious movie it has was to see it on the big screen because it's just the most gorgeous nature scenes you've ever seen in your life and it's all this it's the story of this little <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> and it's not
 		like cutesy it's just uh it's just so realistic everything they do you wonder how in the world they ever got them to do some of these things and it was
 	
 	
 		huh oh those a real <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		a real <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> and all the other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> they initially start out in the barnyard kind of setting where they're raised and then the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> gets um on this treacherous journey he climbs into a box and ends up floating down this river and he winds up
 		all over creation i don't know where in the world it is somewhere in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> somewhere i think that it was filmed
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		but uh it's just really an incredible thing
 	
 	
 		sounds sounds sort of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">like The Incredible Journey</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah it was pretty wild  and of course the only sound is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dudley Moore</ENAMEX> narrates it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but there's no you know nothing else  to keep it going but it really keeps
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		keeps me going i i've seen it twice now
 	
 	
 		yeah that that sounds a lot like a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Walt Disney</ENAMEX> film
 		sounds a lot a like a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Walt Disney</ENAMEX> film
 	
 	
 		huh
 		yeah it was like the best of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Walt Disney</ENAMEX> ones <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Walt Disney</ENAMEX>'s kind of
 		gotten worse in my opinion in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past few years</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh yeah not anymore i mean i i i was raised on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Walt Disney</ENAMEX> films you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		Old Yeller uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Red</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah all those old good ones that you you know wish they had on more now but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		when i was a little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX> i saw <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Incredible Journey</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas Eve</TIMEX> and it was so good
 	
 	
 		oh boy
 		hm
 	
 	
 		it was so good that i had forgotten that it was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas Eve</TIMEX> i mean that's something for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		that's pretty good
 		really
 	
 	
 		and that was something for greedy old me at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> time i'll tell you
 	
 	
 		
 
 		let's see what are some other ones i've seen lately i'm trying to remember i can't oh i just saw <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> on the video oh um have you seen <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Gods Must Be Crazy Part Two</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		that is a riot yeah the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> one was really good but the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> one  is really good too i was really surprised
 	
 	
 		is it
 		
 
 		yeah i didn't much care for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> one maybe that's
 	
 	
 		no i thought it was funny but that's my sense of humor i guess
 	
 	
 		well i i'll have to go get that one i guess
 	
 	
 		
 
 		it's hard to find movies that aren't terrible violent or terribly bunch of sex going on anymore and i'm just i guess i'm just middl e <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> or something i just go to be entertained and
 	
 	
 		yeah it's it's
 	
 	
 		and not really interested in some of the like the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Terminator</ENAMEX> or some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schwarzenegger</ENAMEX>  stuff i just
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i i get so tired of you know these you know sequels number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fourteen</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Freddy</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Revenge Part</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Twenty Five</ENAMEX>  or whatever
 	
 	
 		yeah you know yeah you know <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Freddy Eats</ENAMEX> a Nuclear Warhead you know i i'm just
 	
 	
 		yeah i never
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i i'm so sick and tired of that i just can't believe it it's like <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Rocky</ENAMEX> films i i haven't seen a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> i can't stand <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stallone</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i've never seen any of those
 		yeah i can't either he seems so macho i just
 	
 	
 		yeah and i i was afraid that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rambo</ENAMEX> was going to do the same thing that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rocky</ENAMEX> was going to do you know go into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fourteen hundred</NUMEX> episodes
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		now i don't i hardly ever watch TV if i ever get the hankering to see something i've got i don't know maybe <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about thirty</TIMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">forty</NUMEX> movies and i just
 	
 	
 		yeah when they're so cheap too at the video <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> that you can
 	
 	
 		yeah i don't even rent them you know i i figure if i find a movie i like i'll buy it because i just watch them over and over again
 	
 	
 		that's like my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> does that he can watch them over and over and i'm there's very few i would want to see that many times so he he once he has one he likes he likes to watch it over and over
 	
 	
 		yeah i
 		yeah my my very favorite one that the top of the tick for me is uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Excalibur</ENAMEX> i i loved that film um
 	
 	
 		oh yeah that was a good one i haven't seen that one in a long time
 	
 	
 		it's just so well done and i lived over in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four years</TIMEX> that was the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> place i ever saw it and it was just gosh it was so good
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh boy
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it was it was filmed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ireland</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh
 		huh
 	
 	
 		and they got pretty scenery in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ireland</ENAMEX> yeah it's nice
 	
 	
 		yeah i bet
 		gosh
 	
 	
 		and i i've been down to the south of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX> where supposedly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arthur</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">castle</ENAMEX> was
 	
 	
 		oh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> so that really has a lot of meaning for you to see that
 	
 	
 		yeah it was yeah it was unimpressive to look at i mean the whole thing was about the size of a a medium <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>  yeah it wasn't no
 	
 	
 		oh really well when i was in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX> and i went to to like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shakespeare</ENAMEX>'s and you know Stratford-On-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Avon</ENAMEX> and all that  and it was like you couldn't stand up inside of it because it was so short the ceilings were so short but
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		yeah yeah
 		yeah there's some nice stuff over there to see i i spent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four years</TIMEX> traveling around and didn't see you know hardly anything i just
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		oh boy
 	
 	
 		i need to go over there and stay about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty years</TIMEX> so i can just travel go around all the places <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stonehenge</ENAMEX> of course you know every everybody makes the obligatory trip to Stonehenge
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		okay big deal here's some rocks sitting out in the middle of a field okay  it's boring
 	
 	
 		did you see any movies over there  i remember i went to see <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Don Quixote</ENAMEX> over there when it came out it came out right around the time with Sophia Loren
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and that was a riot to see that
 	
 	
 		you know something i come to think of it i don't think i went to the movies one time
 	
 	
 		yeah because when you're touristing you probably don't want to take the time to
 	
 	
 		i uh where i lived uh it was a little town called Newmarket
 	
 	
 		go see a movie but
 	
 	
 		<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about seventy miles</NUMEX> north of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> and there was another <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barry Saint</ENAMEX> Edmunds <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about twenty miles</NUMEX> away from us and they had a little uh theater company
 	
 	
 		huh
 		oh boy
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		there and we use to go go out to that about once a week yeah a really nice place you know <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">amateurs</ENAMEX> but really quite good uh but that was interesting course used to
 	
 	
 		oh boy
 		yeah
 		that sounds great
 	
 	
 		go to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> quite a lot and see shows down there
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh but other than that i just didn't have time to go to the movies you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		never show any anyway anything that i ever wanted i rented a lot of videos  because the closest movie theater was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barry Saint Edmunds</ENAMEX> and who wants who wants to drive <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">twenty miles</NUMEX> to go to the movies
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh boy
 		
 
 		probably some of them did
 	
 	
 		a lot of a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> did but it would have to be a good show
 	
 	
 		yeah it's hard to know what the good movies are anymore because sometimes the reviews you just can't go by and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i i use they they they have all these neat phrases you know you know you know like critically acclaimed that's what they when the thing hasn't won any award
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 		oh i see
 	
 	
 		you know they can't
 	
 	
 		it's kind of like waterfront property or something if you're you know if you're <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">two miles</NUMEX> away from water
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		yeah from <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Love Canal</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		water view
 	
 	
 		waterfront property here at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Love Canal</ENAMEX> you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but you know critically acclaimed oh good grief give me a break
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		that's what i mean there's a lot of reasons why i don't go to movies and primarily i mean i now i'm probably going to going to upset you but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who bring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> irritates the heck out of me
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
