 
     		
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		there we go
 	
 	
 		well uh what do you think about taxes do you think we're paying too much
 	
 	
 		yes and no income tax no i uh i look at it this way uh you've got to pay for the privilege of living here
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		being a uh  a rec <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vehicle owner</ENAMEX> well in fact i live in a motor home
 		i'm a full what they call a full timer
 		and uh it burns gas like crazy i only get <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">seven miles</NUMEX> to the gallon
 		i really resent this fact that they keep adding on gasoline taxes and they call it uh
 		uh what's the word they use anyway a luxury a luxury tax
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		they gave add it on on to tires and gasoline cigarettes liquor
 		and it doesn't bother me any because i've quit drinking and i quit smoking
 		so that doesn't bother me but i don't think it's fair it's it's too um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um it's attacking just certain people
 	
 	
 		how true
 	
 	
 		and even with the gasoline tax
 	
 	
 		yeah well gasoline especially in this part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> we all use it all the time you know it's
 		that's not what i would consider a luxury
 	
 	
 		no uh  <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fifty years ago</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">automobile</ENAMEX> was a luxury but it's a necessity today
 		and uh as hard as they try to get these
 		public transit things going i have never seen nor heard of one that uh really really got of the ground
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		or that accomplish what they set out to accomplish to accomplish
 		what are your feelings on it
 	
 	
 		well um i i think that we probably are paying a little too much tax considering what we're getting for it and
 		how it's being managed and so forth i mean i i think there could be a better system and we would get more for our money
 		it's totally out of our hands so we don't we can't really do a whole lot about how that money is spent and where it goes and and
 	
 	
 		yeah that that's that's so true i mean they say well you voice your opinion uh uh uh on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">election day</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		but not really
 	
 	
 		no you don't look what happened on the last presidential election
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		read my lips
 		and what happened they turned around and double crossed us
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so uh i mean you you can't believe what you what you hear
 	
 	
 		well i think too one of the things that rubs me the wrong way the most is those programs that are funded by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> and
 		that
 		don't seem to have any validity at all i mean they're always far out and
 		uh you know they're studying some
 		obscure
 		uh bug you know in some other part of the world or some such thing and and our tax money pays for those things and i think that's wrong
 	
 	
 		oh
 		uh yes
 	
 	
 		i
 	
 	
 		i agree and and uh
 		uh i also think we extend too much help to other uh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> we need
 		enough help here in this country
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		they're still <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> starving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> here why should we help starving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> somewhere else
 	
 	
 		yeah and i think here lately they've
 		been saying quite often and maybe somebody's coming to realize that we're the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> in trouble
 	
 	
 		absolutely absolutely
 		now i can't wait for uh i i could just picture what's what's going to happen here in the not to distant future
 		we keep hearing well we're going to receive uh <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">eight billion dollars</NUMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> for the uh
 		uh uh the
 		uh uh the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the the big</TIMEX> war over there in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mideast</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		the war
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh so many <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">billions of dollars</NUMEX> here and there and everything and uh
 		the next thing you know we'll be turning turning around just like we did to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX> and say well just forget it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and i think that's a mistake
 		somewhere somewhere you know we have to realize that we can't just keep giving it away
 	
 	
 		oh definitely
 		well another thing now they they keep the
 		decontrolling different things first it was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">airlines</ENAMEX> then it was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX> and and uh um savings <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> and what not
 	
 	
 		we know what trouble they got into
 	
 	
 		exactly and the same with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">airlines</ENAMEX> back in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the days</TIMEX> when they were uh controlled
 		and and uh uh transcontinental or um um um um interstate
 		uh trucking
 		i mean as soon as the uh the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> gave up control on all that they just went to hell in a hand basket
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> prices went uh sky high
 		you know in the in the case of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">airlines</ENAMEX> of course they became highly competitive and they cut each others throats until they're they're reach the point where they're cutting their own throat
 		and uh well of course that's getting away from taxes isn't it that that's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> controlled
 		but um
 	
 	
 		well i i think another thing too that um i've had a little contacted with
 		uh in regard to taxes let's say that um you have something that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX>
 		disagrees with or you know says hey we're not going to allow that well i think they're very unfair in the amount of
 		penalties and interest that they can attach to that
 		because you you will not only pay back that that you wrote off but you will at least double
 		that amount and
 	
 	
 		oh by the time you get through with the uh
 	
 	
 		yes and that's to me there's something wrong there you know
 	
 	
 		the penalties
 	
 	
 		yeah i mean i can see paying the interest and some small penalty but they really stick it to you big time
 	
 	
 		uh i agree i think the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> is uh just too powerful
 		there should be some sort of a control on it
 		and they should be a little more humane
 	
 	
 		um-hum absolutely
 	
 	
 		uh the um well typical bureaucratic i guess
 		uh that's that's one of my pet peeves
 		i came up with a brilliant idea how we could reduce the uh the budget
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		very simple give uh uh uh government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> the average number of of uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">holidays</TIMEX> as the uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh the private industry
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i mean you think about it now they they get about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixteen holidays</TIMEX> a year
 	
 	
 		that's a lot
 	
 	
 		it sure is and i think here at <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> we get what is it <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		well i haven't counted
 		i i would have guessed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> even but you might be right i don't have any idea
 	
 	
 		well i remember uh thinking i think it was the last time i did hear that we get about the average maybe even a little more
 		a day or so more than the average
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> is ridiculous
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		just think of the money they could save
 		i mean they're they're paying out this money anyway
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		why not get the work out of the people
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and well anyway that would of course eventually come back to taxes
 		but uh as far as income tax is concerned i can't complain too much about it um
 		i'm single i have no
 		uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dependents</ENAMEX> or anything my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> are all grown
 		and they're out worrying about their own income taxes
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well i i have another thing that i thought about too um
 		for instance when you try to save money and you earn interest on whatever your investment is
 		and you know we're not typically talking about big dollars but
 		here you feel like you've you've done something good you've you've earned your interest and then you have to go back and pay taxes on it
 		so the real amount of your savings on that is is not much
 	
 	
 		um very true that's
 	
 	
 		you know it's kind of a vicious circle there
 	
 	
 		and then they tell you to uh well invest it in uh is it IRA's or something and and when
 	
 	
 		and then they took that away as far as
 	
 	
 		when you turn
 	
 	
 		being
 	
 	
 		when you turn <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixty five</TIMEX> why then you pay the tax on it
 		and the tax is a lot less
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but in the mean time you used used them
 		you've got your money tide up
 		in a low relatively low interest
 		uh bearing investment
 		i mean it's not making <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> fifteen percent like a business is today
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">huh-uh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um me i'm a firm <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">believer</ENAMEX> in that if you got it spend it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well you can come over to my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and spend it
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well you
 	
 	
 		i wish i had some to spend
 	
 	
 		well do you do you need some help spending yours
 	
 	
 		no no i don't i just don't have any
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh uh-huh well that's my problem too i'm i'm trying to figure out from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> payday to the next whose going to be the lucky one <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this month</TIMEX> that's going to get paid
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		yeah that's the way it goes
 		well i guess we probably talked <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">just about</TIMEX> long enough
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh let me ask you something did you get a catalog or something from these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> yet
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		you did
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i've everybody i've talked to has received <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> and i haven't gotten mine
 	
 	
 		i don't know
 	
 	
 		um
 		well anyway <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ellen</ENAMEX> it was nice talking to you
 	
 	
 		you too
 	
 	
 		and uh until next time
 	
 	
 		
  
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">okay good-bye</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		bye-bye
