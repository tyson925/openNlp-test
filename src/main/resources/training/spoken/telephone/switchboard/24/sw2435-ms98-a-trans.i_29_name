 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay so what kind of movies have you seen lately i guess
 	
 	
 		um
 		a lot well the last movie i saw but it wasn't my choice was the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ninja Turtle</ENAMEX> movie
 	
 	
 		obviously you have kids
 	
 	
 		that's right yeah but my preference is the one we saw before that was Silence of the Lambs
 	
 	
 		i haven't seen that one yet
 	
 	
 		that's an excellent movie
 	
 	
 		um the last movie i saw was uh <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Sleeping With The Enemy</ENAMEX> and i uh see i'm not a big <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Julie Roberts</ENAMEX> fan but i was a lot
 	
 	
 		oh was that good i heard
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		i was i was a lot more impressed with her than i though i would be it turned out to be a better thriller than i was expecting it to be so yeah it was a pretty good movie
 	
 	
 		well that's good
 		yeah
 		Silence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lambs</ENAMEX> kept me on the edge of my seat
 	
 	
 		i i'm ready to go it just it's you know hasn't worked out that way yet you know it's uh it looks good you know
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah it is right and i do
 	
 	
 		if you like thrillers anyway  in fact <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> i've talked to said that they hadn't slept real good for a while afterwards so  so
 	
 	
 		oh really oh i love them like that i'm not i mean i i like all ranges of movies but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i like that where they run tense i really enjoy they keep me guessing the whole time it's really it was really interesting
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		uh-huh well what other movies have you seen then lately
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		other than the i assume you were talking about the new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ninja Turtles</ENAMEX> movie
 	
 	
 		yes the new one of course
 	
 	
 		is that any good i mean i'm sure i'm going to be seeing it because in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a week</TIMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amarillo</ENAMEX> where my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> lives and she's got <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> that i took to see the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> one so i'm sure i'm going to see the next <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> here real soon
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh it really was i didn't see it the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> one my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> said it was um about the same lines
 	
 	
 		oh well then it won't be too bad you know it wasn't impressive necessarily but it was better than it could have been
 	
 	
 		so yes
 		right right and um i was impressed with the fact that um
 		it wasn't that childish you know what i mean it wasn't my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> i mean she understood everything she goes to almost all movies with us except you know R rated and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		she really enjoyed it but it was on a higher level you know where there were some things that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> didn't understand that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> did and i liked that
 	
 	
 		right right yeah i think that's important if you're going you know if you're going uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> are going to uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> are going to have to go you ought to make it at least semi you know
 	
 	
 		right
 		that's right that's right it's pretty good but we take her to just about
 	
 	
 		semi for them too so yeah
 	
 	
 		every movie and she uh she does really good we've taken her from real young and she does real good like i said we don't take her to R's so if and when we ever get a babysitter like we did with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Silence</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lambs</ENAMEX> we go see it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		i was about to say you're not going to take her to that one i'm sure do you take her or do you go to a lot of comedy movies or to
 	
 	
 		oh no no
 		yeah yeah um
 	
 	
 		what was the last comedy you saw
 	
 	
 		oh gosh what was the last comedy we saw huh huh huh good question  good question we don't get to go that often but i'm
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		something on the tip of my tongue and i can't think of which one it was um noise
 		gosh i can't remember i
 	
 	
 		the last uh in fact i guess this was the last movie i saw i said that wrong the last movie i saw was <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Hard Way</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael J Fox</ENAMEX> well that really wasn't too bad it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		but that that sounds good
 	
 	
 		there were you know he's supposed you know he's this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actor</ENAMEX> right and he's he's playing a a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cop</ENAMEX> well he's he's he's hanging around with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cop</ENAMEX> trying to pick up the the stuff i think he did an excellent job in not being too much of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cop</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		right
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		you know i mean there there were times when he was like he'd be running with a gun or whatever he didn't look like a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cop</ENAMEX> when he did it and i was so impressed with that because
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		that's neat cause that the part was hard to do that
 	
 	
 		you know you oh yeah because i mean everybody grows up looking at these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cop</ENAMEX> movies and trying to you know to imitate them or whatever and uh i thought he did such an excellent job of not
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		going that far <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">now</TIMEX> by the end he was looking more like a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cop</ENAMEX> but at the beginning of the movie and all through the middle part you know he was trying to trying to get it but he wasn't there yet but you could tell
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah
 		right
 	
 	
 		like i said i thought was a real good acting and writing job both you know because i think or directing job i think they did a real good job of that and um <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Woods</ENAMEX> i think is who it was did an excellent job as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cop</ENAMEX> i mean you know he just yeah
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah i like him
 	
 	
 		yeah and there were there were some definite um should i say tense moments with him in there so
 	
 	
 		probably the last comedy we saw now that i think about it is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Home Alone</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yes i i i had seen it before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> but i took a date to it uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about a month ago</TIMEX> so i i i've seen it the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> time not too long ago so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		it was really cute
 	
 	
 		i really enjoyed it of course the bad thing about it was uh
 		uh the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">the second</NUMEX> time i saw it i didn't really enjoy it as much and i was kind of surprised at that i thought that would be one of those that i would love to watch over and over but before maybe it's just the idea of my reaction the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time i laughed so hard i was hoarse
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i really was i was hoarse getting out of there and maybe i just laughed so hard the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time that i didn't have it i mean it just wasn't as funny the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> time because i had just gone overboard the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time i don't know but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right
 		yeah maybe so maybe so
 	
 	
 		yeah i mean it was it was a great movie though i loved the movie
 	
 	
 		yeah i did too i'm looking forward to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this summer</TIMEX> uh <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Naked Gun Two and a Half</ENAMEX> is coming out
 	
 	
 		i love those movies
 	
 	
 		i do too i mean they are just slapstick it you have to see those <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twice</NUMEX> to catch everything
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		well you have to see them more than that i i i still catch things in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Airplane</ENAMEX> that i didn't catch
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah those
 		yeah i do too
 	
 	
 		i its amazing i love those movies i really do
 	
 	
 		so i'm looking forward to seeing that because that looks hilarious as they all do well we  we try to go
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> of times a month i guess to see a movie it it's just getting so expensive
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh isn't it though you know but that's at least the good thing about
 		the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> letting you buy the tickets cheaper that's exactly what i was going to say i keep not doing it until after i'm there and then all of a sudden i'm saying i wish i'd bought these things
 	
 	
 		right but normally we don't think about it until  right
 		i know because we can go spend fifteen dollars just getting in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of us yeah
 	
 	
 		easily yeah yeah and then if you want popcorn and stuff it's just i mean uh it's incredible
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i don't understand why they charge you out the kazoo for both you know popcorn is not that expensive so they get you at the ticket <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">booth</ENAMEX> and then try and get you at the popcorn and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coke</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		no no it's nowhere near that expensive
 		and it it's just the idea that these uh these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actors</ENAMEX> you know live in such lavish style i mean it's as simple as that
 	
 	
 		yeah we just keep breeding them
 	
 	
 		yeah and as long as we keep paying the money for it they are going to keep paying them you know yes oh yeah oh that was that was an excellent movie
 	
 	
 		i guess so now have you seen <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dances With Wolves</ENAMEX>
 		did you love it
 		i haven't seen we're waiting for the video
 	
 	
 		no don't don't that needs the big screen it really and truly does because to get the feeling
 	
 	
 		no really
 		oh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		of like when the buffaloes are when they're chasing the buffaloes and everything you've got to be where you feel it you really truly do i would i mean
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh really oh
 	
 	
 		i would i mean i guess my first instinct was to wait for the video too but i'm glad i didn't i really and truly am i mean that movie that was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> movie i came out impressed
 	
 	
 		really
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i really and truly did i mean i have absolutely no problems with them winning <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Oscars</ENAMEX> none at all normally i'm one of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that i don't like <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one one</NUMEX> movie taking all the honors i wanted him to win best
 	
 	
 		that's good
 		i heard that yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		best <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actor</ENAMEX> on top of it like i said i wouldn't given the supporting actresses either one but even though they were okay the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> in it
 	
 	
 		yeah oh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh they uh somebody made an interesting observation now that i think back on it i'd say yeah i can't believe that either she was the only indian to have her hair done at all times you know what i mean you know
 	
 	
 		oh gosh  yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		it was just too perfect at all times that was a mistake that they made they shouldn't have done it now the best the supporting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actor</ENAMEX> he was good
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but from what i heard the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> who got it was better so i you know i can see that but oh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		do you think my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> would like it
 	
 	
 		oh well there are there is one spot that was just a little bit on the gory side but um it's it's
 	
 	
 		or just
 		oh okay she doesn't mind when we cover up her eyes
 	
 	
 		okay no problems it it's just the idea that there is this one spot where the white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> has come by and killed a bunch a buffalo and just stripped its hide the hides so there's you know there's
 	
 	
 		see that's the one that is the honest to God the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> reason i don't want to see the movie is because i love buffaloes for some weird reason  and i know they're fake
 	
 	
 		yeah but well
 		and and of course and well yeah that and plus i mean
 		part of it is the idea that he goes with them on a buffalo hunt so i mean they are killing buffaloes in it but they don't stress that very much they really don't and i think it's an excellent movie for if if she enjoys
 	
 	
 		okay okay
 	
 	
 		movies i think it'll work pretty good yeah
 	
 	
 		oh that'll be good we really need some my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> keeps wanting to yeah and i heard the video's even going to be longer they did a lot of stuff that they cut out
 	
 	
 		it's it's it's a long movie
 		oh yeah
 		i may have to see the video i hadn't even thought of that
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true they said yeah they said there's a lot that had been edited because of the length
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and that they wanted in so they're going to put it in the video and that way you can watch it at your leisure
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well yeah i kind of like it when they do that because the video like i said there are certain things you can't do with a video and the idea that they may put a little extra in it i think is a good idea
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		because i mean when you rent a video videos of course are not cheaper either and um and so the idea of getting a little extra with it i think is a good idea because they they make bundles of money off those things
 	
 	
 		true
 		yeah
 		i know it isn't that ridiculous we have cable which helps a lot
 	
 	
 		oh i do too
 		yeah but not enough yeah i'm getting to the point where you know i watch well i watch <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nick at Nite</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah we keep holding out you know
