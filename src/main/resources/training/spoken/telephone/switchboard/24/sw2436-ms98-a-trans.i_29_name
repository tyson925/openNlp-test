 
     		
 	
 		well i haven't had too much of a chance to watch TV lately so probably everything i'm going to say is kind of dated
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well i can understand that it's it's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that time of the year</TIMEX> uh we just uh my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> and i just recently moved into our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> so we're
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh
 	
 	
 		spend a lot of time on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and out in the yard and things but um i like to keep up to date too um i guess
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		in the since i got out of college which was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about five years ago</TIMEX> i've my TV viewing started to tend more towards uh
 		documentary news programs things like that something that's going to keep me up to date i've kind of kind of gotten away from uh being a series watcher having to keep up to date with uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		oh yeah i think when you're in college you kind of you have more of a regular schedule in terms of you can watch every week
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah that makes a big difference
 	
 	
 		so so yeah i i used to when my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> were real little and i was home i watched uh i was home more i watched things on a more regular basis but right now the last thing i watched regularly was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thirty Something</ENAMEX> when it first came out did y'all ever watch that
 	
 	
 		okay yeah i yeah started too and uh kind of kind of worked away from that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i i have a hard time sticking with something like <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">on on on</ENAMEX> on TV because it like it gets real aggravating if you miss it for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a week or two</TIMEX>  you feel kind of left out but um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah yeah right right
 		i know but i'll tell you what um we're really strict with our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> about television and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one night</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of weeks ago</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it was just a just happened that we were exhausted and they wanted to watch and we said okay well we'll sit down and we'll you know look at what you want to see let's just turn it on and see what's on we could not find anything that had any kind of redeeming value in it
 	
 	
 		i believe that
 	
 	
 		and so we you know and it was prime time it was what <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven thirty</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">eight o'clock</TIMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a week</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> and no we have cable and there wasn't anything on any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> and and the stuff that was on the prime the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> you know <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC NBC CBS</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		was it was just um dribble
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		do you know i mean it wasn't even funny it wasn't creative it it was the worst i've seen i mean i have not watched prime time <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> TV i guess in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a real long time</TIMEX>  because i was shocked
 	
 	
 		that's right
 		yeah
 		well i i know exactly how you feel
 	
 	
 		you know what i'm saying
 	
 	
 		that's right i i uh
 		when i <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> moved down here uh moved into the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> and got cable and uh
 		i guess i sort of kind of became numb
 		numb uh nothing surprised me any more seeing it on the TV you know and then all of a sudden i started paying paying attention to um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 	
 	
 		to network TV again once in a while right now we don't have cable and it's surprising how much it's changed the you know the the whole moral situation everything is just just gone one whole complete direction different
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh we we don't have any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> yet but i i feel the same way it's really tough to find something
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		that's that's uh that's going to be good and interesting for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> even even cartoons um you you know you  you watch uh you watch some of the cartoons and
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 		oh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids kids</ENAMEX> aren't even going to understand half the humor that's in there it none of it's probably damaging lot of times but uh
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 		it's just it's just uh like a necessary evil i mean when we when our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> were younger when they were like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four years old three years old five years old</TIMEX> we we just had <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Sesame Street</ENAMEX> and that was about it you know
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		but now in order to seem you know humane and normal we do allow them to watch cartoons and stuff but it's just one of those things you know you have to shut your eyes or not listen or something because those drive you crazy if you're
 	
 	
 		oh yes yeah
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		if you're in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> so but it's such a shame because it could be so good i i don't understand why <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of all why the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> puts up with it and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> of all why the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> think that
 	
 	
 		that's right
 		well that's true
 	
 	
 		you know we enjoy that kind of stuff i can't it's hard to believe that nobody can be any more creative than that that can't be the problem it must be the marketing pressures and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know their demographic studies that they do that show you know that everybody's IQ has dropped dramatically  or something
 	
 	
 		that's  i'm glad you said it and i didn't have to but that that that's the i feel the exact same way i sit i sit and watch some shows and uh and i'm embarrassed for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that are even involved in the show you know why do you do this to yourself
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i know why do you do this
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i know i'm trying to think if there's anything i do you like uh i like stuff that's <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">on Great Performances</ENAMEX> and i we used to watch mystery quite quite a bit and enjoyed that
 	
 	
 		okay yeah
 	
 	
 		stuff i guess that's mostly public on public TV as a matter of fact you know when i was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX>  excuse me my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> used to have we had this rule in our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">every hour of regular</TIMEX> TV that we watched we had to watch <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an hour</TIMEX> of public TV
 	
 	
 		right
 		now there's an idea
 	
 	
 		that was just the rule and if they saw us watching something they'd say all right what did you see on What's New or there was some other the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>'s program i think at the time was called What's New so we had to give a little oral report before we could
 	
 	
 		um okay yeah
 	
 	
 		watch our program but do you watch do you watch sports on TV are you a sports fan
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah that's that's pretty good
 		i can't handle it very long  i i mean i'm i'm a sports <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fan</ENAMEX> but it's
 	
 	
 		yeah  yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		well it's kind of it's kind of like reading magazines any more If <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of the time wasn't spent watching commercials it probably wouldn't be so bad but uh it it's you're missing an awful lot i'd rather personally rather watch
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		right yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		see a game on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T V</ENAMEX> than fight the crowds at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stadium</ENAMEX> but uh but uh no i don't sit down i'll sit down for the big games the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Super Bowl</ENAMEX> and the championship
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true the traffic um
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		you know things like that But i don't follow any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> i check the scores <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the next morning</TIMEX> and i know how everybody's doing and that suffices me But
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		um-hum yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i like i like good comedy good humor once in a while
 	
 	
 		yeah i i enjoy that but what do you where do you
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		oh do you get the comedy you don't have cable now i was going to say they have a comedy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> now but again you're in a situation where you're watching mostly uh commercials and then you're
 	
 	
 		no we don't yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know trying to pass the time to wait till the next <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">comedian</ENAMEX> comes up you know what i did there was a time there where i could um tape things and then i'd fast forward through the  commercials saved a lot of time that way
 	
 	
 		right
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah it works you bet yeah
 	
 	
 		but that takes too much planning
 	
 	
 		yeah no i don't know if there's any any series that i pay attention to i try to watch <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Cheers</ENAMEX> once in a while
 	
 	
 		um
 		now that yeah is that still real good it used to be real good is it
 	
 	
 		yeah it is in fact it's i think it's on <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">tonight</TIMEX>  i just got in from outside so i so i'm kind of
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		out of it Things like that and i consider that fairly intelligent humor you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		you can tell they pick up the words every once in a while
 	
 	
 		right
 		right right isn't it such such a long running
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		program yeah they do have a good they do have good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX> for that oh that makes me think do you watch <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Saturday Night Live</ENAMEX> at all
 	
 	
 		i try to
 	
 	
 		yeah we try to stay up too
 	
 	
 		yeah  if
 	
 	
 		it's getting harder and harder <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten years ago</TIMEX> wasn't so hard to stay up to watch it
 	
 	
 		well yeah you know and and it was it was just automatic too no matter where you were you stopped and and sat down and watched it i think it's come around again it's gone through cycles but uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		right
 		yeah
 		yeah it was it we stopped watching for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of years</TIMEX> in the middle there but we started watching again
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but it's a real different show than it was when it started it's it's funny now and it's better but it's real different than what it used to be but you can't be uh so um you can't be outrageous
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that's right that's right
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know if you keep that same format there's only so long that you can be outrageous so
 	
 	
 		that's for sure  that is for sure
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		well i guess there's a few things around still but uh
 	
 	
 		yeah you have to hunt hard for them i guess
 	
 	
 		yeah sounds like we pretty much agree
 	
 	
 		yeah i guess so
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		its been uh good talking to you
 	
 	
 		yeah good talking to you
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		take care bye
 	
 	
 		you too bye
