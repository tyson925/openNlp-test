 
     		
 	
 		
 
 		so what is your latest experience with painting
 	
 	
 		well  i don't i haven't done any painting since i was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> would be painting and i'd ask him if i could  you know take a turn or something but uh when we bought our home it was recently
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		updated they did that maybe improvements so they could sell it and things so we didn't have to do any painting
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">condominium</ENAMEX> we moved in before my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> went over and painted but i the experience that i've had is that um
 		
 
 		whatever time he gave said oh it would take me about <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">just about four hours</TIMEX> because it was only about like <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eleven</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">twelve hundred square feet</NUMEX> over there
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and he said oh it's going to be just about <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">four hours</TIMEX> well  he was gone the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">whole day</TIMEX> and he said well all i got done was the taping around
 	
 	
 		isn't that amazing it it looks so easy just slapping paint on i had an addition put on
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and um we and i decided because my inner <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> looked so dingy because i put these beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> doors in
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and so i decided okay i'll just you know have them paint this little room you know a little <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> dining area it took <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four days</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and even the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painter</ENAMEX> couldn't give me a good estimate he said well i'll be done <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this afternoon</TIMEX> you know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and pretty soon before you know it you know he's run into so many problems and it's just there's nothing there to be a problem i thought but um it just took him so much longer and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and he was there to paint the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> doors also
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">um</ENAMEX> and if you've ever painted <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> doors which my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> just finally said he wasn't going to do
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		because it looked so formidable um then then just
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 		we we got this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painter</ENAMEX> and i just called him because i got a little ad out of the you know the adcose or whatever in the mail and uh
 		you know just got this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painter person</ENAMEX> over here and he said yeah i can finish it in a day oh right  so the whole project basically took a week
 	
 	
 		oh i know it's just awful
 	
 	
 		
 
 		funny and i go what makes you a professional you know
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		how much you know more do you know than i know about this whole situation but he just kept painting on those <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> doors you know and each little um paint stroke you know the paint wasn't going on right is what it was
 	
 	
 		pane
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so he had to redo them like <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times before i was happy with them before he was happy you know that they even looked halfway decent and
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		so it's just been painting yeah i mean hire a professional but that doesn't guarantee anything
 	
 	
 		no and it really like you said always takes way longer than anyone
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">um</ENAMEX> is able to guess because i know my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> he he painted when he it was just the preparation time was so long that when he actually got down to the painting part
 	
 	
 		right
 		
 
 	
 	
 		he it was like  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> times longer than he already thought he would be done and
 		and uh he did part of the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">in the at night</TIMEX> because we were trying to hurry up and get it ready so we could move in and um
 		and he didn't notice until <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the next morning</TIMEX> that the shades of paint between the two paint cans he had finished one can off and started another one
 	
 	
 		oh no
 	
 	
 		and then when we went in there you know one was blue they were white but one had more blue to it
 	
 	
 		oh and that can make a difference too i mean
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and they bring the uh you know little samples and you've got like maybe <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five hundred</TIMEX> well that's an exaggeration
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but there are just so many tints upon tints upon tints and you don't know what you to want to put up there and by the time it's on
 		i i selected a what i thought was white and it was like you said you know it was blue blue cast to it and it looked awful on
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so that was the next problem he had to redo that too i
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		this was a and it was a major project getting the money together  to do it too by the end of the whole project but
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know we worked something out because he was kind of apologetic that it took so long he really came over here to paint i think because he kept offering to paint the outside of my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>  i don't think he did the interiors very well
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh boy
 	
 	
 		and yeah
 	
 	
 		well i don't recall my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> having that much trouble  with their's i mean you know they painted our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> all the time and we had a a wooden we hardly we just had brick on like as accent
 	
 	
 		no
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		on a certain area of our <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">home</ENAMEX>  growing up and so he had to paint the outside all the time  and um
 		i just don't think you know that there was that big problem
 	
 	
 		it wasn't a big deal for them i don't know
 	
 	
 		no but to us you know we're going oh we're so glad we have a brick <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> all we have is like trim around the windows or something and
 	
 	
 		i think my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>'s really glad about that
 	
 	
 		no uh no painting to have to do i i don't know that we
 	
 	
 		for sure
 	
 	
 		like uh say we're freshly graduated from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> and things so we haven't gotten to the point where we're hiring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX> to do too much of our
 		needs do
 	
 	
 		you you just you just get in there and do it yourself
 	
 	
 		we've been trying to you know we've done that the whole time we were in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> like trying to repair our own <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> and things and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so i i want to get to the point where i could feel like i could just hire someone
 	
 	
 		well it's it's not that easy it's like it's uh i don't even know if i you know i would not even recommend this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> again to anybody i don't know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		a i guess you get i i don't know if you get into the mind set where you just say well i'll accept something or you just really have to get on their back i mean about things and and working with what they say are professional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painters</ENAMEX> i mean
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i tell you what the fumes that the the paint gives off makes you wonder what these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> do anyway
 	
 	
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		
  
 		i mean the fumes are amazing and i i don't think i could stay sane you know and
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		working with all that so i mean i know it's not lead based any more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">paints</ENAMEX> but my goodness
 	
 	
 		but still
 		it's harmful and they have to live with that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		i well yeah i  think so
 	
 	
 		in in their clothes and everything
 	
 	
 		oh it does
 	
 	
 		the only painting job that was really painless for us was in this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">condominium</ENAMEX> that
 		the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">um association</ENAMEX> that manages it they have to take care of like the structural
 		damage there was a roof leak and that was not something that we had to pay for so they sent their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painters</ENAMEX> in to
 		to repaint a corner of the ceiling and then you know repaint the whole ceiling in a certain <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> but they came in and um
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		they came in and did it and left in just no time at all and i think it's because they
 		you know they were accustomed to working in that  environment in those particular condominiums
 		and i don't i didn't watch them but i couldn't imagine that they came in and painted it the whole ceiling you know just within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a couple of hours</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		ri ght
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		well maybe there are some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX> out there  it makes you wonder
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		really it does uh for all that well um i hope you have a nice day today
 	
 	
 		um
 		well you too i guess it's getting getting to be <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">lunch time</TIMEX> i need to go take care of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> but you have a good day
 	
 	
 		and you take care
 		okay okay bye <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kay</ENAMEX>
