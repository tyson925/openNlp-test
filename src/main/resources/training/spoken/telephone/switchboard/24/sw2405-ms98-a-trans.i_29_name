 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		hi how are you today
 	
 	
 		i'm great
 	
 	
 		good well as a matter of fact i'm before we started this conversation i was working on my PC at home
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh do you have one
 	
 	
 		no i don't have one at home i work with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> on at work continually you know but i do not have one of my own at home
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		do you have
 	
 	
 		what do you have at home
 	
 	
 		we have an um actually it's a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> computer but it is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um clone it's not the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> PC from back when
 	
 	
 		right
 		from the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the oldies</TIMEX> but the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">goodies</ENAMEX> it's probably pretty close to what i have because i have the same kind of thing at work i have a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three eighty six</NUMEX> S <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> which is <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> computer but everything in is in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> mode so
 	
 	
 		right
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		right
 		right
 		yeah that's what we have um
 	
 	
 		do you use it a lot at home what do you
 	
 	
 		well i really do i um am an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">accountant</ENAMEX> and but i work at home
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so i use it for that quite often um
 	
 	
 		so you're on it a lot
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		we have you know used some of it for some personal things we keep track of personal budgets and things like that on it um
 		i since it's tax season i'm doing a lot of taxes so i do a lot of um a lot of that work on it as well
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		i was amazed when i took our taxes to our tax <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> and she works out of her <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> also and the uh software that does the taxes is just incredible you know i mean she just
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh it is
 	
 	
 		you know i expected to go and you know drop the stuff off and go back <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks later</TIMEX> and you know she had it done and out in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty minutes</TIMEX> on her little PC it was great
 	
 	
 		yeah you can that's right
 	
 	
 		that's wonderful i have often thought that that having <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> at home would be neat i just don't know if we would really use it that much you know
 	
 	
 		i
 		we really we decide we didn't decide to get one until i started working at home
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		then you know then we thought well we can use it for you know some personal things but it for us it really took you know a business application to justify the expense of it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh definitely definitely i know my stepfather bought my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> a little personal computer oh i guess probably <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three years ago</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> and
 	
 	
 		so
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and you know it's got some stuff on it it's got a nice little word processing software on it you know and some budgeting type things and stuff and i don't think she's ever touched it
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		you know it just it just seems like a lot of trouble for something at home you know she always seems to have better things to do than to try to sit down and figure out how to use her computer  you know so
 	
 	
 		right she could just as easily do those things by hand
 	
 	
 		yeah just as quickly
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		now i know my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boss</ENAMEX> has bought the software um that he can that his his checkbook is on on on a disk and he goes in and prints and types his checks on the screen and then hits print and they print out on the checks and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and he's ordered envelopes with the windows in the right places you know
 	
 	
 		oh my gosh
 	
 	
 		and he just whips out you know i saw him <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> over there and
 		and he paid his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</TIMEX> bills and he just you know wrote all the checks on the screen and hit print and it printed out like <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> checks and he just you know they're perforated and he just ripped them off they go through just a continuous thing on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">printer</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		huh
 		right
 	
 	
 		he ripped them off and stuck them in the envelopes and there they went you know and he said you know i can balance my checkbook in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">seconds</TIMEX> you know because it's all in the computer you know so
 	
 	
 		right
 		and you know there's not going to be those adding mistakes that we all make
 	
 	
 		that's exactly right he said you know he said used to be i always sat looking for those you know he said this way there isn't any you know it does it for you so
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		this you know there are some definitely some some advantages to it it's just a matter of like you say are the advantages does it justify the cost if you're using it strictly for personal business so
 	
 	
 		right
 		i i think in most cases i'd have to say no not unless somebody really enjoys it or
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		perhaps is using it for education i have a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four year old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> and we have some education programs that he likes a little <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Sesame Street</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> and um we have another one that plays music and he really likes that one
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		as he grows up he'll be even more and more too
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		that'll be great
 	
 	
 		yeah and now i think about it i guess for for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> like as they get older especially now
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh when they get to junior high school <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">high school</ENAMEX> and even college i mean my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> went to college um started <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about three years ago</TIMEX> and she had to have a a computer
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		i mean it was like a necessity she couldn't imagine going through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">college</ENAMEX> without a computer
 	
 	
 		well yeah i
 		i'm going through right now i'm you know going part time in the evenings and you know i do yeah everything has to be typed i mean they require it you have to type it you know and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		right
 	
 	
 		and so i'm up here you know <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">nights</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekends</TIMEX> you know working on the little PC on the PC up here you know typing stuff so i can see where it would be a great advantage to have one at home you know if you were going to school
 	
 	
 		sure
 		yeah any more i don't even know if they have if a college <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX> would have a typewriter
 	
 	
 		well you i don't know no i can't no and they probably used to have it i just finished a a major research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of weeks ago</TIMEX> and i couldn't imagine not having that thing on a disk where i could go back in and move stuff around and change it i
 	
 	
 		probably not even no
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i don't know what they used to do  before they
 	
 	
 		well unfortunately in our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> and i went through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">college</ENAMEX> together and then he went on and got his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Master</ENAMEX>'s degree while i was working
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i'm the better typist of us and we just had a regular old typewriter not even a correcting one back then it wasn't that long ago but
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh and you had to type all of his papers
 	
 	
 		i typed his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Master</ENAMEX>'s papers and things on a typewriter oh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> to have a computer back then
 	
 	
 		oh gosh
 		oh cut your time in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> at least
 	
 	
 		at least i mean and then of course you have some changes to make and do the whole thing over you take out a sentence
 	
 	
 		at least
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		on a computer you take it out bleep print it out fine take out a sentence on a piece of paper
 	
 	
 		uh-huh you
 		you do the whole thing over
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		that's right you know i remember when i was working in high school you know i was working in an office and right right after i got out of high school i continued working there for probably <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">another year</TIMEX> and we did everything on a typewriter
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and we did everything on a typewriter you know everything but it's amazing you know then when where you know someone would have you type a letter
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		they did it right they did it right i mean they were yeah they sit there and they go is this really what i want to say and you typed it and that was it and now you know <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> just send it back over and over and over and over
 	
 	
 		the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time yeah
 		that's probably one of the problems and frustrations that it's brought about because <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> do feel like oh well we can just change it if you need to
 	
 	
 		well we'll try this out and see what it looks like yeah so
 	
 	
 		right
 		use it as a just a
 	
 	
 		yeah instead of knowing what they want to say before they ever they just you know play with it and which in a way is nice to be able to do but you know it it gets a little out of hand sometimes i've seen it get out of hand up here you know where
 	
 	
 		right
 		i know
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		you know we've got a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX> that sits over here that's keeping metrics right now and keeping up you know of all the letters i type how many changes how many of them do i make changes on
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and on each letter what types of changes are they typos are they because i couldn't read it or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> just change a like one word because they think it sounds better or whatever
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and you know she's also keeping a percentage you know what percentage of letters am i retyping for whatever reason and there's like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one week</TIMEX> she she did retypes on <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">ninety percent</NUMEX> of what she typed
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		i believe it
 	
 	
 		you know and it's like you know it's ridiculous and that was that was the high <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week</TIMEX> but it's running about seventy which is still ridiculous to have to make changes to seventy percent of everything that she types you know that's
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		well it's good that she does that i mean bring it to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>'s attention
 	
 	
 		well that's exactly right you know she keeps you know keeps <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several weeks</TIMEX>' worth of data and then in addition is keeping copies of all the changes to show you know look this didn't really need to be changed you know this is this is ridiculous and you know changing add this time to now
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know i mean that's the kind of things you know <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that she's keeping and showing that this was a big waste of time it was a waste of paper it was a waste you know to change something like that so
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		anyway maybe you know maybe it'll it'll help in some way but i don't know there there there definitely even with the few disadvantages like that are far better than the alternative
 	
 	
 		oh i have to
 	
 	
 		you know without a doubt without a doubt
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well i would like to get one at home <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">some day</TIMEX> we've got a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two year old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> and so you know some day i would like to get even just like the video tell or something like that you know just to to be able to pull in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources sources</ENAMEX> from outside would be wonderful you know so
 	
 	
 		right
 		especially when they're in school i think they would get a lot out of it
 	
 	
 		oh i do too i do too the on line um encyclopedia just sounds wonderful you know that that sounds like such a great idea you know it'd be kind of fun to be be able to play with it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh oh yeah
 	
 	
 		so i know my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> had a PC and and when we were in high school it was always fun we could um link in and i don't even remember now what it was called but you could link in and talk to other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> talk to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> all over the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> you know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and like you have your own little code name you know and you'd type in  hi how are you  and they'd type back and everybody and you'd have <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">five or six</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> talking to each other at the same time and everything everybody said
 	
 	
 		right
 		
 
 	
 	
 		prints out on your screen as they're typing it and it was just great fun you know
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		it was very expensive because the whole time you were on there you were on long distance you know it was like a long distance phone call so we were each limited limited to like <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty minutes a day</TIMEX> you know so
 	
 	
 		ooh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		ooh that still could add up
 	
 	
 		it's oh it added up big well you know we my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> were divorced and so the time we were like visiting our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX> time you know so he felt like he could splurge and let us do it you know i'm sure we would not have been allowed to do that under normal situations you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but when you're doing the guilty father complex you know because he's not there to watch us grow you can kind of get all kinds of stuff you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 		
 
 		oh
 	
 	
 		that's sad well it was nice to talk to you
 	
 	
 		well
 		yeah you too
 	
 	
 		have a nice you too
 	
 	
 		have a nice day
 		bye-bye
 	
 	
 		bye-bye
