 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well i've kind of resisted having any <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pets</ENAMEX> because well i had some <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pets</ENAMEX> as a child
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but uh now that i have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> they're sort of like <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pets</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you have to take care of them a lot and they require a lot of time and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">um neatness</ENAMEX> and plus you know now that i'm married i have
 		a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> that i do some things that you know help him
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and so it seems like i have plenty things to do and so i thought that if we got a pet that that would be just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> more person
 	
 	
 		what kind of pet did you have as what kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pets</ENAMEX> did you have as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		well the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> you know the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> wanted
 		
 
 		the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> love all kinds of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pets</ENAMEX> you know <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> and things and i know some kinds of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pets</ENAMEX> are more
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 		independent and as a child i had um you know like a we had a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> and we had <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">turtles</ENAMEX> and
 		we had um
 		you know small lot of the small things like i know we got a little <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bunny</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Easter</ENAMEX> once and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		a little baby <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chicken</ENAMEX> and all that but they say you shouldn't do that any more but um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well i have um i have a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> that i've had for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about eight or nine years</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and i wouldn't trade her for anything  i also have a child
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">cat</ENAMEX>'s lot easier  to take care of than the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> you can go away and leave her for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few days</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		yes
 		they can take care of themselves especially <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> are pretty good about being independent
 	
 	
 		yeah i've left her well i've left her alone up to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about four days</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		because she doesn't she's real good she doesn't overeat or anything
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and so i can leave <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> out and know that you know she only eats when she's hungry i know some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> that no matter how much you put down they'll eat it all
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and then if i'm
 		if i'm gone longer than that then i'll have somebody come in and um you know make sure that she has food and and fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> usually i just leave a faucet dripping in a bowl in the kitchen
 		and i've even she drinks out of the toilet
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well we just <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX> we got a gerbil that's a thing that i picked for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> because they were wanting to have a pet and i i didn't want to have one i picked gerbils because
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		they apparently they aren't like you know they don't smell as bad as other
 	
 	
 		uh well you have to keep uh if you don't keep them clean my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> had gerbils and you could smell it as soon as  you walked into their her house
 	
 	
 		yeah oh that's awful and i don't like that odor and um
 		and they don't require as much but we'll see how it works out it wasn't as
 		it's not something that um i had to like learn to
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		something that's going to be running around your <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> that if you're unaccustomed to that you wouldn't like such a big change and
 		they stay in their little <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cage</ENAMEX> and  you throw a few things in there they're not loving you know you know like a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah can you hold did they let you hold them or
 	
 	
 		well we're just getting used to them right now we're kind of just letting you know touching them
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and we've picked them up before but that was kind of scaring them pretty bad right now
 	
 	
 		was it are they young do you know how old they are
 	
 	
 		well they they
 		seem like you know they were smaller compared to some of the other ones
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but we
 		we i did that i
 		let the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> have a pet because
 		i wanted them to have practice in caring for someone else and you know not being so selfish
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		how old how old are your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		they're <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four and five</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		okay <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mine</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i thought it would be good for them to just practice you know having someone else to care for and
 		everything i know that a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pets</ENAMEX> a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have pets
 		because they make good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">companions</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		they do or my <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> does to me like she doesn't like anybody but me in fact no one would know i had her because if anyone comes over she immediately goes into hiding
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but um
 		i i had a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> for a while before i had my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> and i grew up we grew up having <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> and i'd like to have a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> but
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		kind of like for the same reasons as you i just the care that goes into them and you know if i you know decide to take off for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a week</TIMEX> or so
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know i can't leave a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> like i can leave a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and plus they require a lot in the way of training and
 		which now that i'm home would probably be a good time to do it if i were going to do it but
 		you know i just don't you know there i don't know why but with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> it seems you have to have a lot more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vet</ENAMEX> bills
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		plus they're more expensive to get
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		now my <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> i've had her for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eight or nine years</TIMEX>
 		i had her spayed and i had her declawed which you know was an initial expense but
 		then she has not been sick <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX> i have never had her to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vet</ENAMEX> other than just her you know her maintenance stuff
 		and it seems like whenever i've had a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> you know something always they're always getting sick or you know breaking a leg or
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		something
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i just i don't need that expense right now plus they eat more and
 	
 	
 		expensive to maintain and
 		keep the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">flea powder</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">flea dip</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		yeah that yeah i don't know if that's such a big problem here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		my <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat stays</ENAMEX> inside because she's declawed so i don't really have a problem with that but yeah if you had a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> you know they need exercise and you have to walk them
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		that's true they are a lot i guess that's the number one reason why i'm
 		i'm not really ready to have a pet too much  i kind of consider these gerbils just kind of something you look at
 	
 	
 		
 
 		not really pets just kind of things
 	
 	
 		yeah they are not
 		because they don't really acknowledge that they know you you know it's not like a pet pet a pet is someone that comes up to you and is happy to see you and that kind of thing
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah yeah
 		well they make you feel special you know i live alone with my <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five year old</TIMEX> and my <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> and she really does she makes me feel like she cares about me and
 	
 	
 		but
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know it it gives you some strokes there that you may not get otherwise because i'm cooped up in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all day</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		and um
 		i would like to have what i would really like to have is an aquarium and have some really nice fish
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		but until i get in a place where i feel like that's where i'm going to be for  a long time they're just their so hard to move
 	
 	
 		a long time
 		yes and they they take up a lot of you know good space you know kind of like a bookcase
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		now i have some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> who have aquariums and i enjoy
 		watching the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> and looking in at them you know but that's something that you really i feel need to learn about and read about you know you need to learn how to take care of them and you need to learn
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		what <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> are compatible you know and what ones you can put together and what ones you can't you know how to feed them and how to you know to clean them you know the thought of cleaning an aquarium is not very  pleasing but
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		with filters and all that stuff that they have now i mean they're almost maintenance free
 	
 	
 		yes and i noticed um that's kind of what i was attracted to these gerbils for is that they they have a certain area that they use like their bathroom
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and you can just um you know rinse that out it's kind off to the side it unscrews and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well that's good
 	
 	
 		and so you can just take it out with a garden hose rinse it out
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and you supposedly you don't have to change all of the the bedding and everything except <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every three weeks</TIMEX> which is not very often
 	
 	
 		well that's good yeah that's not bad
 		i had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> i managed i guess when i was in high school or junior high i managed to talk my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> into letting me have a gerbil
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i won't tell you what happened to it  if you just got them you don't
 	
 	
 		oh no
 		it's something awful  oh
 	
 	
 		poor thing part of it was my fault i guess i just didn't take care of it like i should have
 	
 	
 		um
 		well i'm hoping that it'll be a little bit of diversion for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> and a little bit of a
 	
 	
 		do they like to watch him
 	
 	
 		they do and they're anxious for us to be able to hold it but i
 		these just aren't going to be as tame as the book i got a book first
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		they just don't seem like um well i guess we've have them <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about a week</TIMEX> now and they're just not kind of
 	
 	
 		how many did you get did you get <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> are they male or female does that make a difference
 	
 	
 		two
 		well we hope that we got <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> so that they're supposed to get along better
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and they won't have any babies
 	
 	
 		but you don't really know
 	
 	
 		i guess we won't know unless they never have any babies
 	
 	
 		really until there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about six</NUMEX> more in the cage
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well you know the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that sold them go well it's hard to tell but we think and we're going oh great
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh no
 	
 	
 		so if they have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">babies</ENAMEX> then we'll have to get rid of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of them
 	
 	
 		
 
 		but i've heard that it
 		that after they have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">babies</ENAMEX> that you have to separate the then you have to separate the male from the female or the male could hurt the babies
 	
 	
 		yeah that's what i hear so i'm hoping i think they have a really quick reproduction cycle of only like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty days</TIMEX> or something
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">within a month</TIMEX> i guess or two we'll know
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh no
 		that's funny
 	
 	
 		well i guess i better run go
 	
 	
 		okay well it was nice talking to you
 	
 	
 		yes nice
 	
 	
 		and good luck
 	
 	
 		well thanks and it was nice to hear that you've had such good luck with your <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah i i i know my <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> she's reaching her life expectancy and i'm already thinking oh no
