 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">hello</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		hi uh my name's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nicole</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hi Nicole</ENAMEX> i'm <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Ann</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh where are you <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Ann</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh i'm in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McKinney</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh you're i'm in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX>  not very long distance
 	
 	
 		i see okay
 		no not at all and yet long enough if we were calling back and forth it would be a toll call
 	
 	
 		
 
 		it would
 		yes it would  okay are you uh do you know about the topic
 	
 	
 		uh if if i understood correctly it was what what changes we might uh suggest or whatever for the justice system is that  perhaps above my head
 	
 	
 		yeah  uh justice system or and what we think about the uh judge changing it to so the the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> would do the conviction or no sentencing sentencing
 	
 	
 		sentencing and would all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">jurors</ENAMEX> have to agree on okay that'd be a good place to start
 	
 	
 		okay
 		all right i'm going to push one
 	
 	
 		all right
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		have you ever served on a on a jury trial
 	
 	
 		yes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">time one time</TIMEX> but we found him innocent so uh
 	
 	
 		was it was it a criminal
 	
 	
 		yes it was this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> bit another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX>'s finger off
 	
 	
 		okay
 		oh oh
 	
 	
 		but he deserved it i probably would have bit his finger off too if he was trying to strangle me or beat me up you know if i could have gotten his hand in my mouth i'd have bit him just like this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> did he was scared he was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh my
 	
 	
 		you know and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> was trying to beat him up this older teenager was shacking up with this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ex-wife</ENAMEX> or something they were uh uh
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		they were really in a mess and there were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> involved and it was just terrible but i didn't think anybody you know they all deserved to go to jail not just the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> you know
 	
 	
 		uh
 		it really does sound like it was a self defense kind of thing
 	
 	
 		it really was he was trying to beat him up so you know we found him innocent so i really don't know what happens after you find them guilty i thought that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> did do the sentencing
 	
 	
 		no i served on on both a criminal and a a civil um <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jury</ENAMEX> and in my criminal trial he pled guilty
 		um to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> to to kidnapping and so we went through the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> part of the trial because in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> parts <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of all to find if they are guilty or innocent
 		he already said he's guilty so then then we go through the trial to determine what uh punishment should be meted out
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so we still went through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three days</TIMEX> of of uh testimony and so forth and and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witnesses</ENAMEX> saying oh he's an upstanding young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> just weak and was led by another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> and so forth
 		so we were the ones that that came up with the sentence and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> gave us some parameters and said you know
 		according to the law it can be no more or no less uh no more or less than and he gave the the number of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> and he said it would also include a a possible fine
 		up to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten thousand</NUMEX> dollars and and we had that's that took us <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">six hours</TIMEX> just to agree
 		on what we thought was appropriate for this young man
 	
 	
 		good grief that would be hard to do you know
 	
 	
 		um
 		it wasn't the easiest thing i've done but no nor was it hard to to us the young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> had kind of taken care of it when he said he was guilty so we did not
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		we didn't have to struggle at all with that it was now what's fitting and and we'd gone through you know all that so i i don't know i thought that was easier than than trying to decide his guilt or innocence yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah whether he's guilty or not yeah that's true
 	
 	
 		i i probably would not mind letting the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> do the sentencing
 		as long as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jury</ENAMEX> of of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peers</ENAMEX> were determining guilt or innocence for one thing we didn't know that the others involved in the trial had uh
 		or i or i mean had i mean involved in the crime had already come up for trial we couldn't know what had come of their uh sentencing
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and and we couldn't know that until after we'd made our findings so it turned out we had done about what the other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">juries</ENAMEX> had done
 		and so it you know we felt a little better but i think if that could be in the hands of of someone who knew the law and could be privy to that information seems like it would be fairer
 	
 	
 		is it different in different <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> do you know
 	
 	
 		since it's state uh laws yes
 	
 	
 		because i know on some at times the news you know and they say the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> gives the sentencing and so that's what i guess i thought it was that way everywhere being as i hadn't been all the way through you know anything like that
 	
 	
 		it now now it may be on some
 		Federal Laws you know it it this was a
 		we were dealing with uh with the state laws not necessarily  not necessarily federal that may have something to do with it and it may be too that if it were um a capital crime
 	
 	
 		state yeah
 	
 	
 		uh capital murder or something like that that it may be different
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well i wouldn't oh that would be hard
 	
 	
 		yes it would
 	
 	
 		it would be hard to sentence somebody to death if you weren't really really really sure
 		you'd have to be really really really sure that he did it
 		i mean really sure
 	
 	
 		well i had a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> who sat in on a or who was on a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jury</ENAMEX> recently for a murder
 		but the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> was not being tried for capital murder and so that was not even an option
 		uh the death penalty was not an option
 		so and in in this case everyone on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jury</ENAMEX> felt that it should have been  and they were very convinced the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> had no redeeming
 		uh qualities and couldn't be rehabilitated and they were they were really upset that he was getting off so lightly for the heinous crime that he had been involved in
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		i'm real glad that i don't that i don't work in that kind of a
 		uh a background
 		background i'll take my job any day
 	
 	
 		yeah think of the pressures
 	
 	
 		
 
 		you know
 		i don't work with perfect <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> anymore than anybody else does but i can handle the imperfections that i'm around i i could not work in the in
 		the uh criminal area for very long as a as a police <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> as uh someone who works for the court system or whatever
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so anyway back to the original question i really think i if if we were still allowed to choose guilt or innocence
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		i'd be more than happy to let the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> determine the uh the sentencing
 	
 	
 		the sentencing yeah i agree i agree with you right i do agree with you i i figure that it's been <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of years</TIMEX> now since i've served now so i'm i've been looking lately for mine  it's about time for me to get called up down there again
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um
 	
 	
 		so i enjoy doing it
 	
 	
 		i do too
 	
 	
 		as long as i get paid well now before i worked for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> and i didn't get days uh time off for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jury</ENAMEX> duty you know it was difficult
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh i bet
 	
 	
 		because there are a lot of places that don't give you time i mean they give you the time but not the pay
 	
 	
 		i see okay
 	
 	
 		so you know you lose <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a day</TIMEX>'s pay and you  well you make <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about eight dollars</NUMEX> or whatever it is you know
 	
 	
 		big deal oh you make <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">eight dollars</NUMEX> now in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas County</ENAMEX> huh it's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fifty</ENAMEX> here in Collin
 	
 	
 		i think it's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> it might i i don't remember
 	
 	
 		it probably is which is about what it costs you to park your <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> right
 	
 	
 		well they send you a free bus ticket and i use it
 	
 	
 		oh do they
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		so you know i come out pretty good on it i mean i get and plus my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> money i come out real good on it now the last <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> i served on i was working at <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> and so i got time off for it but i was working <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">third</TIMEX> shift and that made it a little difficult
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh
 	
 	
 		to decide
 	
 	
 		yeah i i can see how that would be difficult
 	
 	
 		yeah to decide which day to take off and you know do you take off the day
 	
 	
 		before you go oh that would be tough
 	
 	
 		after you go or before you go
 		so it was tough so but anyway well i don't have much more to say about it
 	
 	
 		um
 		what about the other suggestion that they had that uh about the jury all the jury agreeing on the sentencing do you feel that that is a requirement
 	
 	
 		i think if anybody has a doubt you need to yeah i do feel that yes i really do
 	
 	
 		that there there should be agreement agreement
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i think i do too
 	
 	
 		because someone might see something that you don't see i mean you know they may have they may have picked up on something that gave them that doubt that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know yeah i really think everybody needs to agree
 	
 	
 		it's it's it's so easy anyway for everybody to just kind of become a yes <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> and get carried up along with the emotions and so if there's somebody who's strong enough to stand up with a specific doubt
 		i would a whole lot rather go through the expense of another trial because of a hung <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jury</ENAMEX> than that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">justice</ENAMEX> not be meted out correctly
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i agree with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> it's really easy  to discuss something when you both agree
 	
 	
 		yeah well you know that i mean i uh you have to agree on this almost i would think i can't imagine
 		not agreeing that everybody should agree on a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jury</ENAMEX> i i i don't know on ours when we we all really agreed on this did you all have any disagreements when you were doing the sentencing
 	
 	
 		well it took us <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">six hours</TIMEX> to reach agreement yeah
 	
 	
 		i can't remember how many it didn't take us but an hour i think or <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an hour and a half</TIMEX> we were all pretty i think we had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> in there that
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">uh</ENAMEX> wanted to find him guilty because he kept saying he did it then we kept saying he did it but the other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> you know yeah we had to convince him that um
 		you know that yes he did it but he wasn't guilty he didn't need to go to jail for doing it that was you know he did it he admitted it that he bit that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> finger but he did it in self defense so you know we just didn't feel that he needed
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		apparently you all were successful in uh convincing him at last
 	
 	
 		yes finally we did it didn't take
