 
     		
 	
 		okay  what kind of hobbies do you have
 	
 	
 		um mostly what i do i do do some crafts like it mentioned in the thing and then i i read a lot
 	
 	
 		um-hum i like to read too  i was trying to think of some while while it was uh talking about it and then i it took so long for someone to answer i started reading the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX> and kind of forgot about it but uh
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		yeah i i'd say reading's probably one of my biggest ones because it's the type of thing that you can you can do a little bit at a time whereas i would love to do crafts and stuff if i just had the time to do it and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		or if i had the space i live in a pretty small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> and uh i would have to you know put stuff away i have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> so i couldn't really leave it out if i was working on something so reading is a little bit easier to work around
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah you can pick it up and take it wherever you go
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		fills up any time of space i get too involved in reading sometimes that i neglect what i should be doing so i  you get so involved in what you're reading
 	
 	
 		that's true i do the same thing
 		what types of crafts do you do
 	
 	
 		um i do some little bit of woodworking well i used to i i don't have the equipment here we moved to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about a year ago</TIMEX> and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> had a lot of woodworking equipment and i did some of that um here i've mostly done things that i can do strictly by hand um sewing
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and quilting and um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		what else have i done
 		things to hang on the wall
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		mostly just stuff that i can you know use right around the house
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		or give away as gifts
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i've been making a lot of quilts well not a lot but several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">quilts</ENAMEX> lately
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		i enjoy uh sewing and needlework also i've i've uh made some small things um cross stitch things and um back when i was in high school i worked
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		at a uh needlework <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX> and i i used to do the latch hook rugs and needlepoint and things like that and i i still remember how to do it it's just been so long since i've actually sat down and and taken the time to do something like that but i have recently done some cross stitch
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i enjoy doing that it's just <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the same old</TIMEX> thing it's just getting the time to do it
 	
 	
 		yeah i've done some cross um cross stitch but i never count right and i always have to either take it out or have my picture slightly
 		off centered or or something it never has worked it out completely right
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah it takes a lot of concentration i mean it was the type of thing i was i was making some little things for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> and i also made a little thing for a baby gift and uh i thought oh i can do this while i watch TV wrong
 	
 	
 		yeah right
 	
 	
 		no you must pay all attention to what you're doing it's it's it is a lot more difficult than it seems like it would be it took me uh quite a bit of time i thought oh this won't take long at all but i was wrong it took while it took a while to do but it was fun i enjoyed it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> project project i started out one was a big one it was uh
 		it was of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX> and she was kneeling and it was about
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fifteen</NUMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty</TIMEX> maybe
 	
 	
 		oh my gosh
 	
 	
 		and i it was just too much to start with and i still haven't finished it because i stopped i stopped and i thought well i better do some simple things and work up to this because it was just so difficult to to get it done and there were so many different shadings and colors and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh it it was just too much to begin with and i think that kind of discouraged me from doing much more with it
 	
 	
 		yeah that's pretty understandable
 	
 	
 		and i've done some of the crewel and the um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		something similar to that but it doesn't have the specific stitches anyway it's a little bit more loose and not uh quite as structured and i like that a little bit better the variety of stitches and stuff in that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		more like embroidery or something
 		but
 	
 	
 		i'm trying to think of anything else i do as a hobby um
 		i don't even watch TV very much i was <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">tonight</TIMEX> but
 	
 	
 		yeah i was reading when you called  um how about movies do you like to go to movies
 	
 	
 		yeah um
 		yeah i do i do like to go to movies and uh i have a VCR so i like to rent movies and um i have right now i have the movie <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> so i've i've recorded quite a few movies off of that um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		just i've kind of got a collection going of tapes now and whenever i go visit my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> they're always saying well bring some of your tapes and they they always borrow a few of them i was over there they live in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Duncanville</ENAMEX> and i was over there at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Easter</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and they said bring some tapes with you so they they are always borrowing my tapes
 	
 	
 		yeah well we
 	
 	
 		but uh i like to i like to do uh stuff with <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> i like um
 		i have a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> in my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> and i've got a pretty small porch but it's it's uh i've got a few <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">planters</ENAMEX> out there that i i'll uh you know in the winter time i usually plant some pansies in there and then
 		in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX> i'll plant petunias or something that that's colorful and like that blooms a lot but uh haven't done that yet it i i kept thinking that it was going to get cold <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> more time but i think we're probably past that now i probably should go buy some but
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i guess if i had a house i might enjoy gardening
 		some i'm not real crazy about pulling <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">weeds</ENAMEX> and things like that but
 	
 	
 		yeah  the hard work yeah it's
 	
 	
 		yeah i like the planting and  and watering is okay
 	
 	
 		it's so nice though when you have a nice <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">yard</ENAMEX> full of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> it's so beautiful i mean we don't we live in an <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> also
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but i've got a few <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> here but um i'm not really really knowledgeable i i i feel real good if i water them and they continue to grow you know i feel like oh i've accomplished something so i enjoy it but i'm just not experienced enough with it to
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 		i don't know too much about it either <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mine</ENAMEX>'s pretty limited to my little uh porch <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> and  and then the ones in my apartment <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of which don't look real healthy but i don't always get direct sun
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		except in certain spots and so that's probably my problem there
 		but uh
 	
 	
 		have you tried any growing any um like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruits</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetables</ENAMEX> or anything i guess <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetables</ENAMEX> are inside inside like in pots and stuff
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		no i never have tried that just because i don't have that much space on this little porch here in this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment um</ENAMEX> or this little balcony and my my other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pots</ENAMEX> are they're kind of they're pretty big and and i have enough <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> in them that um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it it takes up a lot of my porch area so between that a nd the chairs and the barbecue grill and the fireplace wood there's no room for much else but my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		excuse me
 	
 	
 		my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> used to grow <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tomatoes</ENAMEX> and things at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and i'd
 		i think when i was real little i probably had a finger in on that every time he did it and had to you know be out there and watch and that type of stuff but i've never really tried anything like that since then
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		well i've considered it <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> both but i haven't done anything about it so
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i think it would be nice to just go out and pick some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tomatoes</ENAMEX> off the porch we get lots of sunlight here and the porch is screened in and it's pretty large
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		so u m
 		i think if i just would be if i'd do something be motivated enough to do something i think it would work out well
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but
 		but there there goes that motivation thing again
 	
 	
 		right
 		well i enjoy playing with my <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> i don't know if you'd call that a hobby but i have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> and i gave them a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bath</ENAMEX> tonight so they're a little bit angry at me but uh they didn't like it too much
 	
 	
 		oh  do are you can you put them can you put them right in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> or oh that's good
 	
 	
 		yeah oh yeah right in the tub and and it helps because it's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the time of the year</TIMEX> that they're shedding a lot and cleaning <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> fur off the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couch</ENAMEX> and off the floor is not a hobby of mine so i thought well this'll help you know help them shed and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and sure enough <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> the fur just came off like crazy once i got them in the tub so
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		they're pretty content now but they they were mad at me for quite a while they went and hid after they after they got dried off
 	
 	
 		
 
 		sulked for a while huh  well i like <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> but we don't have any yet we have a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nine month old</TIMEX> with another on the way and we thought well maybe when they're a little bit bigger then we'll or get into a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> with a little more space
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah i'd i'd love to have have some animals
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but i like <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> so we haven't reached a real agreement on that yet  if we get a place where we can have both it'll be great but until then
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i like both but since i'm in an apartment i just i don't think an <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> is big enough for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog dogs</ENAMEX> to me dogs need a yard even little <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> they just need a yard
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats cats</ENAMEX> can deal with being inside all the time just fine but i just think dogs need need to be outside so
 	
 	
 		yeah i agree with you i if we were going to get anything now it would definitely be a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but or even a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bird</ENAMEX> or a fish <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tank</ENAMEX> or something you know
 	
 	
 		yeah now that's an idea  with the with the small babies
 	
 	
 		something small that she can watch but won't take too much care
 	
 	
 		yeah because you kind of even even a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> you never know when they might bite or scratch or something there not as likely to as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> might i guess but
 	
 	
 		so
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		with little ones i'd be kind of scared  to get anything that that has teeth or claws
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah especially when they're not quite to the age of understanding that they're hurting you know that they they grab hold with both hands and then just jerk and
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and if i was a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> or dog i'd respond probably by biting or something i don't know that would be my self-defense but
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well i i think we probably
 		reached our time limit
 	
 	
 		yeah probably so cause and i'm out of out of good ideas for a hobby anyway so well it was good talking to you
 	
 	
 		okay
 		well thank you for calling bye-bye
 	
 	
 		all right bye-bye
