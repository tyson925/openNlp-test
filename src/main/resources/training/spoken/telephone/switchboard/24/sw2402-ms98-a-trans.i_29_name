 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you uh
 	
 	
 		uh we are latecomers my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> and i to the world of golf we started when we were both oh i would imagine he was fifty years old so we've not been at the game that long but we love it
 	
 	
 		oh well good so you're a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">player</ENAMEX> then instead of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spectator</ENAMEX> then
 	
 	
 		uh probably
 		i am a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">player</ENAMEX> but certainly not a good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">player</ENAMEX> uh the highlight of my <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX> is probably the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> times i get under <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh right
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		boy you're you're you're right up there about where i am then
 	
 	
 		oh i see
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		gosh i thought young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> were all good
 	
 	
 		on no young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> like to swing real hard at the ball
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh</ENAMEX> so you find yourself you find yourself in the rough a lot
 	
 	
 		
 
 		they just hit a long way
 		well i'm i'm getting better about hitting them straight but where i get into trouble is around the green
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		my my short game leaves a lot to be desired
 	
 	
 		well we we speak of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> games of <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">golf</ENAMEX> here
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and that would be the long the short and the putt of it
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		the short of it is my weakest part
 	
 	
 		uh-huh we uh often times have made a trip to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mississippi</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX> because of course it's still cold here in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX> and we always hope for warm weather down there and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that
 		we play with uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> foursome are all much longer ball <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hitters</ENAMEX> than my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> is
 		but he finds that by going straight down the middle he usually wins <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about a quarter</NUMEX> a hole because they've been in the rough on the right and then in the rough on the left
 		so he ends up playing just as well as they do
 	
 	
 		yeah i i've you know i see that all the time as a matter of fact i live uh literally right across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> from a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">golf course</ENAMEX> here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh most of the older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX> that go out there and play are exactly the same way all of us young bucks get out there and hit the ball you know a mile
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but it's like <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> fairways over
 	
 	
 		yes our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">golf course</ENAMEX> in this small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> is a beautiful course with a creek running through it so we have some water hazards and we have some sand and we have some hills um
 		for the most part we all use carts uh battery operated <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">carts</ENAMEX> and and most of us own our own <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">carts</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> happens to be on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first time this year</TIMEX> which is a new experience for him uh our membership is very inexpensive um
 	
 	
 		oh boy
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		probably total cost with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</TIMEX> minimum and cart storage and membership would make it about a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">thousand dollars</NUMEX> a year
 	
 	
 		well you can get a walking membership for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">two hundred dollars</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> at the course down here  yeah
 	
 	
 		oh can you really that amazes me
 	
 	
 		yeah it's an eighteen hole course i mean it's it's uh not terribly difficult and there's really there's a a river that runs along the side but it only comes into play on one par three hole
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		there's really not that many hazards on it but uh it's a really inexpensive course to get on
 	
 	
 		i'm always amazed that uh larger areas uh they can play for what we can
 		uh many of our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> who are transferred away from  for some reason or another end up in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> that it would cost them ten <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">thousand dollars</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> to belong to a club
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		which
 	
 	
 		yeah there's a few of those here too
 	
 	
 		right
 		so do you play much
 	
 	
 		no not near as much as i'd like to i mean i've i tend to stay pretty busy at my job and uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and it's hard to get on a regular schedule and then we're pretty active in our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> which takes up a lot more time too so
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum and you probably have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> at home which takes up a lot more time
 	
 	
 		but
 		no we actually don't
 	
 	
 		oh i see
 	
 	
 		we have we have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> miniature <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">dachshunds</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> fish
 	
 	
 		oh my
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well we're down to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> and they don't take a whole lot of time either but we find that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each fall</TIMEX> when the season seems to be shut down here we say <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</TIMEX> we're going to play more golf
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh this is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the second summer</TIMEX> that my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>'s been retired and he did play more <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> of course but we were gone a lot too uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and that makes although we've played golf a lot of places around the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> uh on different trips but it's even though we started late it's certainly become a very prime part of our life in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX> time
 	
 	
 		where have you have you played any in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		never have in fact we just drove through <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> uh in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid February</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late February</TIMEX> i guess and we hoped to play while we were there we stayed overnight in a little town called <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Eastland Texas</ENAMEX>
 		and wanted to play hoped to play there <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the next morning</TIMEX> but it was like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">nine degrees the next morning</TIMEX> and very windy so we just went on to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Paso</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah it does basically though the the golf season only shuts down for maybe <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three months</TIMEX> out of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> if that much you know probably not even that much because really
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January</TIMEX> were about the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> really cold <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> that we had it was up in the very warm temperatures even in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December this year</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh</ENAMEX> that would be wonderful to be able to play and of course from our <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> go to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arizona</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the winter</TIMEX> and they're able to play <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all year</TIMEX> round but
 	
 	
 		
 
 		sure
 		yeah oh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arizona</ENAMEX>'s beautiful
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yes i was amazed we spent the only time we played on our trip was in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Douglas Arizona</ENAMEX> and uh that was just
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		it was just wonderful to be able to get out and hit a ball the course was not not green but it was going to be in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">another month</TIMEX> when they started watering
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so yes it's it's it's become a big part of our lives even though we're late players
 	
 	
 		hey well hey you know it's never too late is what i say
 	
 	
 		well i guess not
 		well maybe you'll get to play more this year
 	
 	
 		well i sure hope so
 	
 	
 		uh well plan on it at least
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		nice chatting with you
 	
 	
 		and with you
 	
 	
 		bye
