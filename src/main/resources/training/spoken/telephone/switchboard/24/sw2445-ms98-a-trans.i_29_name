 
     		
 	
 		i don't know um do you do a lot of camping
 	
 	
 		well my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> and i haven't done a whole lot of camping we but we bought a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">van</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> and we were hoping to to do some camping in the van
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um we did go camping in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arkansas</ENAMEX> not <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arkansas Oklahoma</ENAMEX> uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> in we camped in a tent
 		and uh there were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couples</ENAMEX> with us and there was uh state park
 	
 	
 		oh so  yeah um up here some of the state <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX> are really nice and some of them aren't some of them are pretty rough
 	
 	
 		and it was really nice
 		really
 	
 	
 		um yeah they they just have like outhouses they don't have like a shower <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> or anything yeah but some of them are really nice they have showers and full bathrooms
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		um but i don't know i i've been camping <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a couple</NUMEX> times but i'm not a real avid camper uh a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> i know are but um i don't i don't know that
 	
 	
 		i i don't like really camping in the rough i like the the
 		the little niceties like having electricity available and running <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> and showers and things like that
 	
 	
 		yeah in fact we went we went once to a lean-to and it um i mean there wasn't any electricity on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camp site</ENAMEX> but it was all right but we only spent <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two nights</TIMEX> there i wouldn't want to spend <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">more than two nights</TIMEX>
 		i wouldn't want to go for like a week  but um
 	
 	
 		yeah that would that would be much
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two nights</TIMEX> is good
 		um especially there was a little store close by
 		so it was pretty nice
 	
 	
 		yeah the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">campsite</ENAMEX> that we went to was an area that it's right on a big lake and there's a lot of boating out there and we we went up there uh to hopefully
 		be able to get on the water a little bit but it was still uh it was still too cold
 	
 	
 		oh really oh
 	
 	
 		yeah it it was pretty early in the year
 	
 	
 		um yeah up here you got to wait till <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August August</TIMEX> till the water warms up well it's not that bad but it's still pretty chilly
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um i don't know i was i have a tent and i slept out in it in the backyard and stuff but the thing thing about camping that bothers me is you've got to pack everything
 		and another thing is the thing seems to get it's dirty  you know so you can't keep the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dirt</ENAMEX> out of the tent and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i don't know we have a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven year old</TIMEX> it's pretty funny like stay out
 	
 	
 		yeah we we have a we have a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> and that's just about as bad as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> he he doesn't go in and out of the tent <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred</NUMEX> times
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and use it as a play uh they they like to play in them
 	
 	
 		yeah i don't know how you can really keep uh the inside of a tent clean other other than you know taking your shoes off right before you walk in or something
 	
 	
 		yeah i don't know
 	
 	
 		and and sweeping it out everyday it's really hard to to keep the sand and dirt out of it
 	
 	
 		yeah well what what we were doing we were just going to say we're just going to sleep in the tent and hang out at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>
 		so you know no going in and out and or what he wants to do we had brought his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> along was play in the tent it was like no this is not working  you can't do that you get tent all dirty
 		plus you get it all wet because we were at a beach site too
 	
 	
 		did
 		um-hum um did you have another a big tent like uh um
 		for like a looks like a sitting area type you know like a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> type tent
 	
 	
 		no no but you know i was just thinking of getting one those for the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">yard</ENAMEX> because they they are really nice and um up here we have uh we have quite a few <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes</ENAMEX> at nighttime
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah we don't really have a problem with that um in these areas um
 		and even even when in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oklahoma</ENAMEX> when we camped i really didn't notice a problem with bugs and i noticed that i know that i said that's i've i've lived back east before um and
 	
 	
 		yeah they're terrible  they're really terrible uh but there is this one campsite
 		that it that some of them are known that there is one that's out in this big lake and it's it's it's <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes</ENAMEX> are terrible and then this uh there's this other one that's more up in the mountains but it surrounds a man-made reservoir
 		and there's no bugs that's the whole thing that everyone told me oh i'm i was going to go to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Little Little River State Park</ENAMEX>
 		they go oh that place is great there's no bugs  but oh okay because uh we were having a big a really big problem up here in certain areas we were really affected that bad
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		but really bad it um almost destroyed the  the tourism in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> because of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes</ENAMEX> they're so bad yeah that was it's a really nice area i've been there before and it's
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		i i couldn't imagine get living just <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">sixty miles</NUMEX> north of them but they were plagued they were plagued with them with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes</ENAMEX>
 		and you can go out outside in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daytime</TIMEX> all right but the minute the sun went down  that's when it seems like the minute the sun sets the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes</ENAMEX> come out
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		i mean just the very second it's really strange they uh they must uh
 		work on that you know the
 		the it gets cooler when the sun sets and then they all come out
 	
 	
 		well have you ever have you ever taken any of those um
 		what do they call this citronella lights have you ever used those
 	
 	
 		oh oh yeah yeah i never really noticed how effective they were
 		but um because that wasn't really i i bought them and i didn't really get to use them like oh there's <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes</ENAMEX> let's turn them we just sort of lit them
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and um we weren't bothered that much by <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes</ENAMEX> so we didn't really contribute it to that but
 		um i think in an area that's really thick with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes</ENAMEX> i can't see all this little uh smoke buckets i call them how they work but they they're suppose to work really well
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		oh i'm in my paperwork here that's what i do when i wait for a phone call i get in my paperwork
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		oh
 		to find my most important parts
 		but i don't know i don't know if i'm going to go
 		go i wish was an avid <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">camper</ENAMEX> and i could really talk about like gardening or something i can talk about that a lot but um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i do want to go again we just moved to a new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> into a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> so i don't see camping maybe in the backyard but i don't see going on a camping trip probably till <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next summer</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah i'd i'd like to go camping cross country
 		um
 		i just got married <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">less than two years ago</TIMEX> so we don't have any any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> yet um
 	
 	
 		so it's easy for you to go
 	
 	
 		and yeah so it's easy to pick up and go and so we have a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">van</ENAMEX> and we can just throw a couple of sleeping bags in the back of it
 	
 	
 		um
 		oh God
 	
 	
 		so it's it's not really i guess camping the way <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> picture camping in the tent but
 	
 	
 		i don't know but that sounds like my kind my kind of
 		camping it really does
 		yeah
 		okay um well um
 		that that is the best way to do it is to have a a nice <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicle</ENAMEX> where you can have everything in it plus your tent
 	
 	
 		yeah or or get my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> has a real nice pop-up
 	
 	
 		yep
 	
 	
 		and he just he just tows it behind his truck
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		and he he's got <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> so his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>'ll sleep in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">truck</ENAMEX> in the in the back of the bed
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">um</ENAMEX> and they sleep in the pop-up
 	
 	
 		well those they're kind of nice but they're also um flimsy when you really look at them but then when you get inside they're really nice you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">everything's</ENAMEX> really nice but then when you look underneath it it's just got these little wheels and this just this uh little axle it's like oh my and then a big windstorm it would pick you up
 	
 	
 		yeah he did have a problem uh
 		when he went camping <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> in uh <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Beavers Bend Oklahoma Oklahoma Oklahoma Oklahoma</ENAMEX>
 		um a storm a storm came in and it started raining really heavy and they were all everybody was trying to flee the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">campsite</ENAMEX> and everybody was getting stuck in the mud
 	
 	
 		oh jeez yeah what do you what do you do when you get a i mean like a really violent storm like a tornado just stay in your truck
 	
 	
 		and the
 	
 	
 		i i mean i wouldn't stay in the um
 	
 	
 		well theirs was so bad and they were so close to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> was coming up and they had to get out of there
 	
 	
 		oh
 		so did were they successful
 	
 	
 		yeah they yeah they were
 	
 	
 		but it took them a little while
 	
 	
 		but yeah they  they decided that that was enough camping for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the weekend</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah so did they get stuck
 	
 	
 		no they ended up getting out they ended up helping several other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> though that were that were stuck
 	
 	
 		yeah huh wow so they evacuated it
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah they the whole the whole <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">campsite</ENAMEX> was evacuated i mean some i think some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that had fairly sturdy um
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		vehicles or whatever if they had like a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Winnebago</ENAMEX> or something and they were farther in away from the water i think they stayed
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but everybody that was real close to the water ended up it was either that or their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">truck</ENAMEX> was going to go floating downstream
 	
 	
 		i know i i always i like to like to get right on the water yeah where the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">campsite</ENAMEX> it's so it well like i don't know we have lean-to's up here i really like them like they say they're kind of
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's kind of more dirty than anything you know just just
 	
 	
 		they have them right at the campsites
 	
 	
 		yeah they're they're lean-to's they're um yeah they're pretty nice they're they're uh
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		it's like a little <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> except the whole face is open and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time that we went we got one it was overlooking the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> but it was a big embankment i wanted to get <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> right on the water
 		that was then when we had uh an electrical storm too and it was really it was neat sitting there watching it i mean it was raining when we called in home everybody said oh we were worried about you in that storm
