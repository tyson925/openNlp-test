 		it is uh-huh
 		that's right
 		yeah i enjoy excuse me go ahead
 	
 	
 		sometimes i i said i sometimes i wish i had more space you know i grow a lot of things a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		sometimes i i want to plant something there's not enough room to plant it some of those things like uh you know the things that <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">vine</ENAMEX> like uh cucumbers or uh
 	
 	
 		that's right that's right
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">squash</ENAMEX> or something like that  plant one of those and it takes up your whole space
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh</ENAMEX> takes a lot of room
 		it sure does i made mistake <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one year</TIMEX> and planted some cantaloupe my goodness what a mistake that was
 	
 	
 		oh yeah that yeah they they just run all over the place don't they
 	
 	
 		they do well it was very good it just takes up you know like you say a lot of your garden area
 	
 	
 		right right see i
 	
 	
 		it's the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> and only time i've done that we don't do anything exotic we just do oh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tomatoes bell peppers radishes</ENAMEX> and turnips i mean not turnips carrots beets and things like that
 	
 	
 		the basics uh right
 		uh-huh yeah that's what we do too
 	
 	
 		my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> used to plant a few <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">snow peas</ENAMEX> i don't really care for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">snow peas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">well</ENAMEX> she just <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> a few for herself
 	
 	
 		right peas i i got a few <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peas</ENAMEX> out my garden <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of days ago</TIMEX> the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> one they started them indoors this time i read it and so i
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		did you really
 		oh i see okay we don't start anything indoors we just wait until you know the weather warm enough to stick it in the ground
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i uh i guess you can get an earlier harvest by doing that
 	
 	
 		probably so yeah you can get a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> start on it
 	
 	
 		but uh sure is a heck of a lot of work because you got to watch them <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX> and keep them watered and i i don't think i'll do it again
 	
 	
 		i guess it it might would yeah um-hum yeah
 		well it will make it will make them taste better i'm sure
 	
 	
 		oh yeah yeah i enjoy it i come home from work and and i usually say hello to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> and then go out and fiddle you know just walk around the yard and
 	
 	
 		sure
 		you got to inspect it yeah
 	
 	
 		inspect it and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> want to swing and i push them on swing
 	
 	
 		sure sure
 	
 	
 		and i walk i mow my own lawn and i do i don't have a sprinkler system i i don't enjoy watering especially
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		no i this is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> home we've lived in we've had a sprinkler system and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> it is really nice it sure beats dragging hoses around
 	
 	
 		oh how oh
 		yeah you can have it come on <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">just early in the morning</TIMEX> and and off by the you know by the time you're up and about yeah i i usually get it started for my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> and i and she moves it around ever other day
 	
 	
 		that's right
 		uh-hum that's right it's really nice
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah i'll have to admit i don't i do my own yard i i really don't enjoy doing that i enjoy having a nice looking yard i just don't enjoy the work that it takes to get it done
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		i had a lawn service to do my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">yard</ENAMEX> for me during the real hot <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer months</TIMEX> you know until i retired now i i've lost my excuse for that so i have to  for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last couple of years</TIMEX> i've done it myself
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 		yeah sometimes i wish i could get one of these uh chemical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">services</ENAMEX> to come out and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spray</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">weeds</ENAMEX> and fertilize and all that and take that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> step out of the loop but um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah uh-huh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but uh they want too much money yeah
 	
 	
 		it is kind of expensive it is of course the chemicals themselves when you buy them they're expensive too
 	
 	
 		right right but it's still be quite a bit cheaper to do it yourself
 	
 	
 		that's right If i have a problem discipline you know i think now boy i really need to get out you know and apply something you know and i screw around and don't do it or wait too long or something that's right
 	
 	
 		right and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">weed</ENAMEX> come up and all of a sudden you've got to do something else yeah
 	
 	
 		that's right i'm i'm kind of bad about that i enjoyed having a lawn service but now i have the time and i really can't i really don't you know don't want to spend the money for it yeah that's true uh-huh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well if you enjoy it too you know you you can get out in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX> when before it gets hot and do it
