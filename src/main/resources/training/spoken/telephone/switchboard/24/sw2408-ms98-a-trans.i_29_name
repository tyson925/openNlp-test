 		maybe maybe if we didn't put them in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carriers</ENAMEX> maybe they would enjoy it more i don't know

 		probably so probably so

 		uh when i bring that <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cage</ENAMEX> out she knows what's going to happen  it's probably i don't know maybe it's the maybe it's the thought about the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vet</ENAMEX> that worries her

 		that's what she does yeah that's right
 	
 	
 		it's so pathetic to see them down there
 	
 	
 		yes it really is
 	
 	
 		i'm just uh it irritates me the way people
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mistreat animals</ENAMEX> and and they don't do it intentionally they just they're just doing it they go out and they think oh wouldn't it be cute to get a kitty
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		get a kitten yeah um-hum
 	
 	
 		and they go out and they don't have it fixed or anything and it has kittens and they can't support it and they take them down there and they end up getting
 	
 	
 		that's right
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		that's right or move off and leave them
 	
 	
 		or move off and leave them and they they end i don't know where this one the my next door <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX> had a had a dead <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> next to his front porch yeah i'd seen the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> around here before i thought it belonged to somebody but i have no idea what killed it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		oh gosh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah good grief may have been poisoned or something
 	
 	
 		it might have been might have gotten hold of something bad or it we had a cold snap here not too long ago it may have frozen out there i i sort of doubt it <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> know how to take care of themselves
 	
 	
 		yeah um-hum
 		could be could be
 		um-hum no not if they've never been out in any weather i wouldn't think so especially
 	
 	
 		yeah well this this one was definitely outdoor <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> because i saw him all the time and i suspect somebody had just had him and moved off
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX> uld be yeah that that's too bad it really is it is
 	
 	
 		it's it's sad i mean and they do it to dogs
 	
 	
 		absolutely yeah um-hum
 	
 	
 		the last dog i got i think was that way because he was uh he was in fairly good shape but apparently just didn't have a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> or couldn't find his way <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> and i don't believe it because he was one smart dog strange mixture he was uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		right um-hum
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		the best i can figure he was part Lab because he had a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Lab</ENAMEX> head
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> and definitely part Grayhound uh bloodhound because he had these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> big old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">jowls</ENAMEX> had the bloodhound mouth but he had the soft bite of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lab</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		bloodhound
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and he was the smartest dog i've ever seen he just i could talk to him and he knew what i was saying
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum yeah they they are smart they really are right next door or my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX> across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> has a couple of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Labs</ENAMEX> they're really nice dogs they really are
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		well my my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> raises my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> raises <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Labs</ENAMEX> and he gave <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to uh he gave <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to me <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several years ago</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		i see
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and she was she was just the sweetest little thing but they love to chew and so after she had chewed up my my redwood furniture
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah yes i've seen that
 	
 	
 		uh she chewed the corners off the picnic table and chewed cross <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> off chairs
 	
 	
 		yes i've had a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">German Shepherd</ENAMEX> that did that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time
 	
 	
 		yeah oh i ended up getting her a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">six foot two by four</NUMEX> and let and she had the best time with it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		i bet she did
 	
 	
 		she'd grab that thing in the middle and it was just about as heavy as she was and she'd drag that thing around the yard  she was a sight to behold
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		um-hum  that was cheap entertainment wasn't it yeah
 	
 	
 		it was it's so easy to entertain them
 	
 	
 		it really is our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> are all grown and gone and away from home so our our new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> is the you know our <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> and our dog we never really
 		well we had we did have some time to devote to them you know but not nearly as much time as we have now so they've really become <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> they're they're real <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> they really well all of them are
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah well they're enjoyable to to have around i i uh i run a little business out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> here and uh i'm usually alone

 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>

 		i can't get it can't get her convinced that she really shouldn't try to feed my <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> chocolate though she always wants to do a little <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hershey Kisses</ENAMEX> you know you really shouldn't feed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chocolate</ENAMEX> to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> especially a small dog
 	
 	
 		
 
 		no
 		no they they  get get her a get her a box of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">doggy biscuits</ENAMEX> to to to let her feed him
 	
 	
 		so i kind of have to watch her when she's around the dog
 		yeah
 		i guess so yeah some for some reason she just really thinks that little <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> needs some chocolate of course the dog thinks so too
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well of course <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dachshunds</ENAMEX> and Dachshunds like chocolate i i remember i remember that other one too he was always after somebody's chocolate bar
 	
 	
 		they do as a matter of fact they do
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		um-hum yeah they love it they really do
 	
 	
 		my my <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> don't think much of chocolate course they're so they're so damn finicky anyway
 	
 	
 		no
 		oh yeah absolutely
 	
 	
 		it's
 	
 	
 		i think they can read the price tag on the cans of food
 	
 	
 		yeah well they do well it it we found out that didn't work because we even even bought the expensive stuff and they looked at it like you've got to be kidding like you know what are you a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fool</ENAMEX> paying that much money for this
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 		now i think i've experienced my first <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> here that will not eat tuna we have a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> that will not eat tuna um-hum
 	
 	
 		i've got i've i've got <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> that won't doesn't even like anything with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> in it
 	
 	
 		yeah that's strange um-hum
 	
 	
 		yeah actually actually you know <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> is not their natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> that's that's the
 	
 	
 		yeah i thought
 		yeah that's true
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> i don't know why i guess the cartoons and everything <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> grow up believing <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> the only reason they go after fish in a fishbowl is because it's moving it's something something to play with
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 		that's right that's right yeah i believe this is the first <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> that i've ever had that would not even consider eating tuna
