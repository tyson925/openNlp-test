 
     		
 	
 		well <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amy</ENAMEX> it's been uh kind of overcast <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> and cloudy we have a our i have a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> in kindergarten he was having a kite day
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh boy
 	
 	
 		and i was really worried about it raining because it its has been there been some dark clouds and it's been um and it's been pretty rainy looking
 	
 	
 		yeah i've been trying to put weed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spray</ENAMEX> on the lawn for the whole <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week</TIMEX> and you can't put it on if it's suppose to rain within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">forty eight hours</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-oh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and so i keep hearing the forecast it's going to rain it's going to rain it's going to rain but it really hasn't rained yeah
 	
 	
 		i know it just has that i it looks
 		several times in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last couple of weeks</TIMEX> it has looked rainy <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that day</TIMEX> and not not done anything and we have a lot of trees
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		in our yard and our property and they're pretty old big tall <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> and so if it's an overcast day then the weather is pretty blah  because i really have to some sunshine or else i feel like i live in a cave all the time
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah yeah
 		well i get tired with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX> i have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX> preschoolers a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three year old</TIMEX> and a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two year old</TIMEX> and when it's you know not nice and they can't go out it's really the pits so i appreciate it when at lately they can at least go play in the backyard for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an hour</TIMEX> or something you know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		oh i bet
 		
 
 		yeah that makes a big difference but i uh we're kind of new to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plano</ENAMEX> and i'm
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		working on a carnival that's going to be in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of weeks</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">our school</TIMEX> and i'm thinking
 		that this has been a pretty you know rainy season it's been scary it's of kind of been cloudy <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX> and i thought well i'm just not anxious to have worry about the weather
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah well my <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three and half year old</TIMEX> he really wants to have the pool out in the backyard you know so any day i mean all <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Winter</ENAMEX> long he's been wanting a pool in the backyard so i'm hoping you know that
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		it just seems like the weather around here goes so quickly from being <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Winter</ENAMEX> to you know muggy and
 		hot and it's just you never really have like nice cool <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixty five or seventy</TIMEX> degree weather with sunshine you know and i really miss that i'm from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicago</ENAMEX> originally and i miss some miss <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seasons</TIMEX> that you know that we used to get up there that you just don't have down here
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		well i know in um i'm from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Missouri</ENAMEX> and we always had pretty nice <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four seasons</TIMEX> and and you know extreme we have some extreme weather in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each season</TIMEX> but um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i like that and we moved here from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Houston</ENAMEX> in
 		in uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July</TIMEX> and everyone kept saying oh you're going up north it's not going to be so hot it's not going to be so humid and yeah that has just not been the case it has been
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh really yeah it's pretty hot here during the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Summer</ENAMEX> gosh
 	
 	
 		oh it was extremely hot i thought i was going to die my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> i thought it was going die <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last summer</TIMEX> but
 	
 	
 		do have air conditioning in your <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> or
 	
 	
 		well the air conditioning was broke but broken i guess it just couldn't handle
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX> and the heat the record heat and you know i was worried about every time we came to an intersection that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> started idling rough you know because of the extreme heat
 	
 	
 		oh
 		yeah yeah
 		yeah i know my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> doesn't have air conditioning in his <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> and he when he comes home from work you know during the Summer he's just well he feels like he's burning like he's been baking for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an hour</TIMEX> gosh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		oh i know that's really awful but but i uh understand that this is kind of typical for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this time of year the rainy season</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		what i hate is i hate having to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> so much around here you know well we never used to have to water our lawns you know in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX> it was always enough <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rain</ENAMEX> here and there
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		no
 		sure
 	
 	
 		but here if you don't water it just looks awful and i just hate to spend the money just going down the drain in watering grass you know
 	
 	
 		brown
 		yeah that is that is awful and it it takes time and the and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>
 		they you have to water your lawn and they want to go out and run in it and get all muddy and you know so you're going do i want a dirt a green <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">lawn</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a muddy feet</NUMEX>  in the house
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah we have a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> too so that adds to it you know been tracing in and out with whatever the weather is like out there so
 	
 	
 		oh no
 		
 
 		well i don't know do the nice thing i'm looking forward to is uh not having a hurricane season
 	
 	
 		oh yeah because <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Houston</ENAMEX> was really hurricane <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">alley</ENAMEX> wasn't it weren't there a lot of hurricanes there or
 	
 	
 		yes we always had to
 		big concern about hurricanes because we're close enough to the coast and you know you had to have a supply like uh emergency supply on hand all the time during the hurricane <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX> and
 	
 	
 		oh boy
 	
 	
 		and it was pretty spooky this
 	
 	
 		yeah that would be gosh
 	
 	
 		they always have to think you know what's the weather doing and
 	
 	
 		keep the weather radio close by and stuff like that
 	
 	
 		right and do we have enough for you know um
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> storage and enough uh batteries and all the kinds of things
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah really every time i store batteries i wind up going to use them and they're dead they've been stored so long  oh boy well then this is a little bit of relief although they still have warnings all the time around here for
 	
 	
 		that's right
 		so
 	
 	
 		you know tornado season hurricanes and stuff so
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		well i yeah i don't really like tornadoes either
 	
 	
 		but
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh at least there isn't at least  i feel like i got rid of something
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		hurricanes so not too much of that
 	
 	
 		yeah well i've been worried about mostly with having little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> now with taking them out in the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Summer</ENAMEX> and getting them burnt up i mean i have to keep the sun screen on them just constantly when they go outside
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		because they say it's just so dangerous for little ones to get a bad sunburn
 	
 	
 		and it is and i just i can't believe this the record temperatures that have were here <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last summer</TIMEX> that
 	
 	
 		so
 		yeah
 		a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundred and ten</NUMEX> degrees and
 	
 	
 		it was just unbelievably hot and
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i can't stand to be outside at all when it's like that i just don't even want to go out you know the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> to get the mail even  leave me in the air conditioning
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that is pretty bad
 	
 	
 		we had our air conditioning broke break last <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last</TIMEX> Summer the switch got something wrong with the switch and we had to call somebody out to fix it because i couldn't take it more than <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a few hours</TIMEX> without it on but
 	
 	
 		oh i know i can't imagine even well that would it is just pretty bad but so i guess um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i guess the weather hasn't changed too much from here to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Houston</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but it is like you say coming a little bit further up north
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		it's a little bit nicer to have a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spring</ENAMEX> and a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Fall season</TIMEX> where you have some pleasant weather everyday where you can feel like you just want to open your windows and
 	
 	
 		no
 		yeah that's really nice i hate having to leave the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX> closed you know closed up all the time
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and get some fresh air in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and it feels good but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but i guess
 	
 	
 		well have you been here during the real heavy heavy rains i mean i can't remember what time of year i think it's usually t his time of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> when we get some
 		just torrential down pour gosh there was flooding our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> had flooding so badly it was like a foot deep in their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		no but i remember
 		
 
 		oh no
 	
 	
 		they had to replace all their carpeting and everything it was miserable
 	
 	
 		now that sounds awful
 	
 	
 		yeah that would not be fun
 	
 	
 		no i have seen those i have driven around in the neighborhoods and seen those little flood gauges that will be there little yellow signs
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it's you know has it like from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> foot to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> foot and i thought i would never buy a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> were there is a flood gauge down the street
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		oh gosh no kidding talk about asking for trouble huh
 	
 	
 		yeah that would be awful
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		well i've got some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> out on the trampoline i need to go look and see what they're doing
 	
 	
 		okay well have <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a good day</TIMEX>  thanks bye-bye
 	
 	
 		well you too bye-bye
