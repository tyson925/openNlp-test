 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		are you in the new car market right now
 	
 	
 		no i'm not uh and i won't be for a while it's kind of called not having the money but  i always like to look at what's out there are you looking at <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> right now
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i'm not looking right now but i have been considering what i would purchase uh in the near future
 	
 	
 		what have what are you thinking about
 	
 	
 		um well i'm getting in the in my <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid thirties</TIMEX> now i'm looking more for a uh
 		kind of a luxury <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">sedan</ENAMEX> i guess i'm driving a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> door <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">coupe</ENAMEX> sport <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">coupe</ENAMEX> right now and i'm getting a little tired of it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		so you're looking at uh luxury luxury <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> a little bit bigger
 	
 	
 		yeah a little bigger and
 	
 	
 		have you looked at uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buick</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Riviera</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i haven't uh really been out looking at <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> uh
 		uh it's something i would possibly consider
 	
 	
 		it is well i happen to drive that one just because i think it looks nice and um i owned a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buick</ENAMEX> for a while and it it performed real well
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um
 		um i don't i have a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> that have bought <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> recently and it just seems like there's and epidemic um <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who that buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Honda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Civic</ENAMEX> uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Honda Accords</ENAMEX> its like everybody buys a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Honda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Accord</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and i really don't know
 		what makes them select that over
 		any other car
 	
 	
 		i don't know i've been told to check out the uh <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Acura Legend</ENAMEX> first though
 		and i guess they're made by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Honda</ENAMEX> as well
 	
 	
 		that's
 		oh are they i didn't know that i didn't know that
 	
 	
 		it's the uh luxury line of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hondas</ENAMEX> i think
 	
 	
 		uh
 		and i uh
 		i've read some articles too about oh i think the last <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> that got me going i don't know much about it at all but those little Geos
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		they're kind of cute and they get excellent gas mileage i mean they're like the top rated gas mileage <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> out there
 	
 	
 		yeah i do need something that gets a little better mileage than what i'm getting getting right now
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i get <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about thirteen miles per gallon</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		whoa
 	
 	
 		
 
 		now i've been uh leaning more towards looking at uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mercedes Benzes</ENAMEX> say <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four or five years old</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh that sounds nice
 	
 	
 		not the new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> but uh ones that are more affordable
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		they tend to be very reliable and uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that uh own them uh typically have them serviced on a regular maintenance schedule i think they're kept in uh better condition than uh most other <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i agree with you there i have uh a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> who has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> and you know another thing is is they don't age they always look the same so you really don't know what what year it is
 		uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah they don't change style very often i like that
 	
 	
 		they don't
 		and uh they you know they're a quality <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> they
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		if you were to buy uh a new car right now what factors would do you consider uh looking at to make you decision
 	
 	
 		well i would definitely have to look at price
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh
 		and i would look at
 		what i could afford uh
 		i definitely would chose a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> on on what appeals to me as far as looks but it'd have to be dependable uh
 	
 	
 		i find that price is always the governing governing governing factor uh regardless of what else you're looking at so
 	
 	
 		it it'd have to be
 	
 	
 		it's difficult to buy something that's out of your price range something that you can't afford
 	
 	
 		exactly and there there's such a range of prices prices in the car market that if you don't start by narrowing it down by that factor i mean
 		that really gets you into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">just one</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">little</TIMEX> slot and then there are many many options to go to go to from there uh
 		i'd one thing that always interests me is whether or not to buy an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> or a foreign car
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well i yeah i drive a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pontiac</ENAMEX> right now and i've had very good luck with it uh no problems i'm just changing my preference for what type of car i'd like to drive in the future
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		so you're going to uh something a little bit bigger and and having better gas mileage too
 	
 	
 		yeah eventually i'd like to do something like that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		get out out of uh uh driving this uh teenage teenage automobile
 	
 	
 		well you make me laugh because right now i what i did is i i acquired a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> through my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX>
 		which is a nineteen <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eighty four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTD</ENAMEX> and my teenage <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> hates it because it's an old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> car
 	
 	
 		sure
 		well there are <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teens</ENAMEX> absolutely will refuse to drive
 	
 	
 		oh well absolutely and uh it's it's a nineteen <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eighty four</NUMEX> car and it has <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">eighteen thousand miles</NUMEX> on it actual miles
 		so it's kind of thing like i'm going to drive this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> until it dies
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know i mean it's just too good to and then maybe when i go out and look in in the car market i'll be able to get what i really want and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh do you prefer buying uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> new from uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">dealerships</ENAMEX> or uh buying used <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh i think i'm going to fall in to the category of most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> uh in saying that i feel better going to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">dealership</ENAMEX> because i don't know anything about a car mechanically
 	
 	
 		right but don't you feel intimidated by talking to a car <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">salesman</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh that was an experiment i did <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> was i went and and talk and drove a few <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> and talked with the the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">salesman</ENAMEX> and i found that uh i had matured a little bit in that they don't intimidate me at all
 	
 	
 		okay well that's great if they can make you feel at ease that's pretty good
 	
 	
 		uh
 		oh they well they they make you they don't make you feel at ease but i've come to the point where i know that i'm the one they charge and that they can't you know
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		talk me into something um i think they're intimidating to both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and women
 	
 	
 		they certainly are and they try to take advantage of uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">consumer</ENAMEX>'s ignorance towards automobiles
 	
 	
 		and
 		exactly and once you once they sense that you really like something
 		then you're really in trouble
 	
 	
 		yeah if they sense that you're really interested and that's the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> for you they're when they're negotiating position is that they're going to get as much money out of you as they can
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		exactly
 	
 	
 		with as many options piled on
 	
 	
 		yeah the uh i had also had a  had a nineteen <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eighty four</NUMEX> uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Bronco</ENAMEX> too which
 		uh my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ex-husband</ENAMEX> had purchased i paid it off and and when i acquired this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTD i</ENAMEX> thought well i'm going to sell this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> while i can get some money out of it yet so i was
 		the selling a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> and that was interesting because i had to kind of research well what is it worth um and kind of understand what someone would ask me about it
 	
 	
 		sure
 		well you tend to do a lot better on selling a used <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> as an individual placing an ad in the paper as opposed to trading it in at a dealership
 	
 	
 		oh yes absolutely and yet at the same time it's it's a matter of like selling anything else you have to find someone who wants that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pa</ENAMEX> rticular
 		item
 	
 	
 		sure well i've found that any <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> that runs is basically in demand
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh you can go pretty much by the blue book value or by uh comparison uh listings
 	
 	
 		that's what i did is i kind of did a little bit of both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blue</ENAMEX> book is kind of a dream it's kind of like if you can attain it you're doing well
 	
 	
 		yeah um-hum
 	
 	
 		but if you go by what the other <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> are listing for then you can rest assured that you're going to get right in that ball park <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Honda</ENAMEX> so
 	
 	
 		yeah uh yeah i agree with you on that
 	
 	
 		how so
 		how soon do you think you'll be purchasing a car
 	
 	
 		well i'm not sure i'm i'm just uh kind of thinking about it and haven't really made any uh decisions or commitments on it
 	
 	
 		do you think of colors at all when you
 	
 	
 		well i drive a black car right now and i've always liked black but uh i maybe uh interested in other colors uh i'm not really interested in yellow or white
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but i've always had a preference for red
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and black
 		and uh well it's just something i'd have to think about depended on it depends on which uh what <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> are available
 	
 	
 		that's right
 		would you order it or would you uh
 	
 	
 		oh no i would uh go to the want ads in the paper and uh find one that would meet my uh needs
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		well that sounds exciting
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it really does so
 	
 	
 		well maybe maybe sometime soon i don't know probably not <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> i think i need to concentrate more on getting a paint job for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> that i have right now
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and just keeping it in uh good operating condition
 	
 	
 		well that sounds like a good plan you might as well just you know get it enjoy it for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> more year and get it in good shape shape for selling it or trading it in
 	
 	
 		yeah well that's the point it isn't costing me any money right now it's running uh very well and i haven't had car payments for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven years</TIMEX> i enjoy that immensely
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		my goodness
 		what type of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> do you are you driving
 	
 	
 		i'm driving a nineteen eighty <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trans AM</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		the only trouble i have with it is with insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh i'm sure
 	
 	
 		they don't want to insure it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh</ENAMEX> because it has such uh
 	
 	
 		just because it's a sporty <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		powerful enough right right
 	
 	
 		has nothing to do with driving record i have no accidents or tickets and uh  they're very reluctant uh yet even to insure that car
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		i can understand that they're i mean they're just very difficult to work with and they can they can see a potential for a problem even if your record is good
 	
 	
 		yeah well my insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> told me that uh when when i uh bought a new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> or when when i more specifically when i bought my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Honda</ENAMEX>  to give him a call
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		because then he would he would make me a good deal on an insurance policy
 	
 	
 		well that's good
 	
 	
 		but i haven't really no intention of buying a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Honda</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		they don't really appeal to me that much i
 	
 	
 		it uh well it's it's more like an economy car
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		and uh i'd be looking more of uh more for a luxury <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">sedan</ENAMEX> something with a little more status
 	
 	
 		you seem to put a lot of um image into your selection of a car which lots of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> do
 	
 	
 		i really don't consider it to be a status symbol uh it's just i'm interested i know <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who have <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> of that nature and uh they tend to hold their quality
 	
 	
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		and hold their value
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> and they're just very attractive <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">automobiles</ENAMEX> as far as i'm concerned
 	
 	
 		and i liked what you said also about when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> that are uh that are quality cars
