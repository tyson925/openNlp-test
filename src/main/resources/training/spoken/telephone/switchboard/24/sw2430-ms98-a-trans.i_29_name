 
     		
 	
 		well what is it that you prefer to provide as far as maintenance on your vehicle
 	
 	
 		i do all my own maintenance matter of fact i just finished putting a timing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> in my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toyota</ENAMEX>  i do i do all of that myself
 	
 	
 		wow
 		how about that
 		that i'm not quite as mechanically inclined although that some of the the basic things that you need to do for uh the maintenance of your warranty on a vehicle
 	
 	
 		oh sure sure
 	
 	
 		is is stuff that you can do yourself just the oil uh changed and things of that nature that's about where i my expertise ends in in that category just you know
 	
 	
 		well there's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> things that drive that up here one is we is the lack of
 		good service people
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		because there just aren't are not any left hardly around up in this area
 	
 	
 		i believe that
 	
 	
 		and the other thing is the cost it's almost prohibitive to bring it to a dealer
 	
 	
 		boy i tell you i just got my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> back from a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealer</ENAMEX> and when it was in there i had them just go ahead and change the oil and filter <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty four</TIMEX> dollars
 	
 	
 		oh sure sure the the price is astronomical but what i do is
 		i like to do this okay and i and i i like to play with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mechanics</ENAMEX> and that's i really i've done that all my life so
 	
 	
 		huh well that's uh that's quite a savings having that talent
 	
 	
 		and the
 		the little the little <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toyota</ENAMEX> is a nineteen <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eighty three</NUMEX> so  i really don't have too much to lose if i mess it up too bad you know
 	
 	
 		how many miles there is that
 		now what did you just replace
 	
 	
 		the timing chain well the camshaft timing chain
 	
 	
 		now i'm not even familiar with what that where that is
 	
 	
 		okay it's in the front of the engine uh say like directly behind the radiator or the water pump
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and it it drives from the crankshaft it drives uh a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> that drives the camshaft which is an overhead cam in those foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh it it was getting kind of worn the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">one thousand miles</NUMEX> on it and it was getting a little noisy so
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		not so much for the noise but if it were to jump a tooth or something of that nature i would be in serious problems on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">freeway</ENAMEX> and i didn't want to chance <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Irene</ENAMEX> driving the car like that so
 	
 	
 		sure
 		well how much how long did it take to replace that
 	
 	
 		i
 		oh <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three nights</TIMEX> i worked on it <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three nights</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about four hours</TIMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last Saturday</TIMEX> and i just put it in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garage</ENAMEX> and worked on it i have i have a new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oldsmobile</ENAMEX> so i really
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh it's it's it's just a little hobby and if it's not too cold outside and the weather's starting to get pretty nice so if it's not too too cold out i can go out work on it don't have heat in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garage</ENAMEX> or anything but
 	
 	
 		oh sure
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		how much would uh something like that cost in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garage</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh
 		well i figured if i had it done in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garage</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toyota</ENAMEX> dealer i would be looking at probably <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">four hundred dollars</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		jimminy
 	
 	
 		between the gasket kit and the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">distributor</ENAMEX> cap i put on and the new uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> and the labor
 	
 	
 		and how much do you think the parts was by itself
 	
 	
 		well the parts to to me i spent <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty two</TIMEX> dollars on the parts
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		so i really i really don't have heart burn at all with doing it myself over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four nights</TIMEX> tie i tied the car up if <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four days</TIMEX> but we're fortunate we didn't need it
 	
 	
 		oh gosh
 		yeah <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> at a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">hundred dollars</NUMEX> a night that's not still not too bad
 	
 	
 		no i know but you know you you save the markup on the parts and of course you buy them whole sale from the parts <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX> and and you can save a little bit there and you can save an awful lot on the labor which is high <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> like all the rest of us we expect top dollar for what we do and
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		i don't i don't blame the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">garage</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> it's just that it's very very hard to find anybody here that's willing to do that type of work
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		all of our so called <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garages</ENAMEX> are now a convenience <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> that sell <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gasoline</ENAMEX> and they really don't do any repairs anymore so you know you're you're you're you're almost tied to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealer</ENAMEX> to go back to them and
 	
 	
 		right
 		exactly
 	
 	
 		well it seems like they're just swamped with work so
 	
 	
 		well
 		yeah well unfortunately i just had replaced the the power antenna uh you know it kind of dumb having the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garage</ENAMEX> door i drove out before the door was completely up and the radio was on so it took off the antenna
 	
 	
 		sure
 		sure
 	
 	
 		but the mast itself cost uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty four two</TIMEX> dollars
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i went i called the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealer</ENAMEX> and they wanted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two hundred and</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty</TIMEX> to put it in
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">sure</ENAMEX> and that's that's held in by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> bolts and a bracket and a plug of wire in the bottom of it no
 	
 	
 		and
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gosh</ENAMEX> and then i went to
 		well it i i looked at it myself to see if i could do it myself because i you know i i feel i'm so pretty competent and handy but unfortunately unfortunately they buried this one in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixty six Mazdas</TIMEX> you have to remove the dash and the fuse box to get to the motor
 	
 	
 		i'm sure you could of
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and so they say there's uh <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three hours</TIMEX> of labor just to uncover where the the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">metal shaft</ENAMEX> goes in because it goes through the through the door in between the windshield and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">driver</ENAMEX>'s side door and comes out above the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">driver</ENAMEX>'s head
 	
 	
 		okay yeah that's one of those that sits up at an angle back there yeah okay yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah so it's terribly engineered
 	
 	
 		well that's that's another problem you know and if you don't have all these special tools of course like i said we're very fortunate with the older <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> we can work on them what
 		um if you don't have all the special tools and the technology i i'd i would hate to buy a brand new car <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> with the electronics that are in them
 	
 	
 		everything was visible
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		i imagine that would be a bear to work on you know uh
 	
 	
 		anymore just putting everything on a chip is your going to have to replace the chip unless you have the tools to diagnose what's the problem with the chip
 	
 	
 		sure
 		uh-huh yes that's absolutely true
 		uh have you done have you done much repair work yourself other other than just routine maintenance like oil changes and stuff
 	
 	
 		but
 		i had a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a seventy nine</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mustang uh Mazda</ENAMEX> RX7
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> year of the rotary engine that i used to do i used to work on because it you know heck seventy <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> if i was to do something screw it up electrically uh i could i handled everything i put in antennas there you know the power antenna the replacement parts all that kind of thing
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		but when it came to ever giving kind any kind of tune ups or things like that i'd take it into the shop anything basically with the yeah
 	
 	
 		that rotary engine always fascinated me i was i was always enthralled by the rotary engine i think that's a neat idea and i'm surprised we haven't gone that way more and and
 	
 	
 		yeah and they just stop making them now
 	
 	
 		yep yep
 	
 	
 		so it's kind of interesting when it's work great smooth
 	
 	
 		it's a smooth running quiet car i i just i don't know why well perhaps the the retooling cost were probably prohibitive to most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> you know
 	
 	
 		i suppose but i had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred and twenty eight thousand</NUMEX> on it when i sold it
 	
 	
 		the uh the automotive industry is in dire needs of something in this in this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> and it's too bad uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toyota</ENAMEX> we bought i i bought second hand i did not buy it new uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but if you look at what's in that little car and as opposed to what's in some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> you can see where we're probably a half a step behind and i think i think we're trying to do something to correct that but i think we got away from us a little bit so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but i i i i just like i say to work on it myself i one i like to do that
 		uh i i think i would do all of the maintenance i change my own <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> and i change of course spark plugs and stuff like that that's routine that i i would call routine maintenance once a year i do that every fall i get ready for the winter
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i even lubricate the car myself because i have a i have means of of running it up on on jack stands and and you know i have a creeper and i crawl around underneath it so it's not a big deal
 	
 	
 		wow
 		sure
 		sure
 	
 	
 		but even <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> like with your <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waste oil</ENAMEX> when you drain the oil and change the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> now i have to bring it to a disposal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> i can i no longer can put it in in the trash you know or in a container yeah we have
 	
 	
 		
  
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		we're we're really on an ecology kick up here i guess like all the rest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		well that's good
 	
 	
 		and and they really really they come down and pound you real hard if they catch you dumping <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> on the ground because it does go in and it effects the lakes and streams and it eventually winds up on the ocean here and it really makes a mess around around <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New England</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		so we have to take the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> to uh a uh a disposal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> that's an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> you know authorized disposal center
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and they gladly take it but they only take it like for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two hours</TIMEX> on a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> you know and it's it gets to be a pain sometime to go through that but i think it's still worth it in the long run
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		because <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> you can buy for eighty <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">five cents</NUMEX> a quart but if you buy that same <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> at a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealer</ENAMEX> it's going to cost you probably <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">two dollars</NUMEX> a quart
 	
 	
 		sure sure of course
 	
 	
 		and uh and now the labor to put it in
 	
 	
 		of course
 	
 	
 		and uh i i again i like to do that i i would do all the maintenance on my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> if i could uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know even even into major things just to keep our car longer because i don't think we get the money that we put into them out of them in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years or three years</TIMEX> and of course i was never in a position where i could trade my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> off <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every two years</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		right
 		well it seems like you've got a very valuable talent
 	
 	
 		uh well i i like i said i've done <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mechanics</ENAMEX> all my life and i do that with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> so uh i'm a senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineer</ENAMEX> for them so i am <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mechanics</ENAMEX> and i i just uh i enjoy it i really it's like a diversion for me i i think if i had to do it
 	
 	
 		oh great
 	
 	
 		if i had to do automotive repair or or anything i love to do woodwork and too and it's a diversion because i know i'd really don't have to this okay so i think i like that because i know i don't have to do this but if if i were forced to do it that may be a different situation
 	
 	
 		hum yeah that's true well it's been good talking to you
 	
 	
 		uh it sure has i really appreciate your call and uh  it's nice to talk with you <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX> from from down in the in the main <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> area and
 	
 	
 		every once in a while down here at the main site
 	
 	
 		yeah sure how's your weather it's pretty good
 	
 	
 		oh it's been beautiful
 	
 	
 		yeah we're just starting to get some nice little warm weather up here in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New England</ENAMEX> it got <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">up to seventy today</TIMEX> that's a good sign we we we've been running around <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty in the morning</TIMEX> and getting real cold and it's too cold to work on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">automobiles</ENAMEX> outside generally but we had <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last few days</TIMEX> been pretty nice
 	
 	
 		there you go
