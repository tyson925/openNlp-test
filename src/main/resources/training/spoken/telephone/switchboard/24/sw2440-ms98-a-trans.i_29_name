 
     		
 	
 		okay um i'm real happy with the car i have  i have a a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hyundai</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh really what kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> do you have
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i bought it in uh eighty
 		no no no eighty <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eighty seven eighty eight</NUMEX> it's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an eighty eight</NUMEX> and uh i'm i've taken real good care of it and i'm real
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		happy with it but if my financial situation was different there's probably other <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> i would like to have
 	
 	
 		oh really yeah me too many many <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> i'd like to have too um i bought a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> around the same time in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eighty eight</NUMEX> and it was a um a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toyota</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Corolla</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and um
 		i like it pretty well except it's not real comfortable it doesn't give a comfortable ride
 		you know it's it's a cheaper <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> and it gives a cheaper ride and it's not the luxury <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> so if i bought one i'd probably want something like a a new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Maxima</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh that a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> is that a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> i have a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> that has one that's just gorgeous yeah they not and then oh they do ride nice too in fact when
 	
 	
 		yes
 		really
 		right you don't hear wind noise and all that
 	
 	
 		yeah when i i was sitting i was sitting here waiting for for her to find somebody i was trying to think what kind would i and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Maxima</ENAMEX> came into my mind
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh yeah</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		she has a real pretty one it's kind of a
 		oh it's not white and it's not beige it's kind of a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cream</ENAMEX> color oh God it's pretty it's got a sun roof in it yeah it's a nice <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> but boy she must have paid a fortune for it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		really
 		yeah well
 		i'm almost convinced that you pay for what you get because my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eighty eight</NUMEX> was like <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten thousand</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">five hundred dollars</NUMEX>
 		and
 		it was okay when i bought it you know it was great running around <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> it's a great little run around <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car town car</ENAMEX> because i get good gas mileage
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but when you're out on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> on a trip like my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> live like <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">five hundred miles</NUMEX> away you are exhausted by the time you get there yeah because it's just
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		the seats aren't real soft and comfortable and there's only so many positions you can get in and your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> gets tired plus you hear the road road noise a lot
 		so yeah
 	
 	
 		i probably do too i like the way my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> rides though uh course i have a sun roof and i open it up so i hear i hear the wind
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh yeah yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		and but it's comfortable to drive i i really don't have much problem with that i think it's comfortable i'm really sold on i you know
 		i i don't remember what i paid pretty close to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten thousand</NUMEX> i think with everything all together it came to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eleven</NUMEX> with tax and everything you know but i'm i'm real pleased with it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		and it did you buy it here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah i bought it at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eagle</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well
 	
 	
 		and i get great service there yeah
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		well that means a lot
 	
 	
 		see i used to work at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lemmon Avenue</ENAMEX> so i that's right across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> from it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so i just walked across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> and bought a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> so to speak yeah you know it was really convenient when i was there because i'd just pull it in during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> you know i worked <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">second</TIMEX> shift at that time and i'd just leave my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> you know
 	
 	
 		yeah got to see them all the time
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and let them work on it i'd bring it in and go to work and then pick it up i'd go out on break at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five thirty</TIMEX> and pick up my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> it was you know real convenient now it's not so convenient
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah well um like how many have you had any major repairs or anything you've had to do to it
 	
 	
 		no not a thing
 	
 	
 		because you know my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>'s about same age as yours and i've been lucky i haven't had any major anything happen
 	
 	
 		it's been
 		me neither and i've i've been really careful to take it when it needs service i do what the book says and i take it in i took you know for the valves
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		for the adjustments at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fifteen thousand</NUMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty thousand</TIMEX> and i change the oil every <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">three thousand miles</NUMEX> and i take real because i figured it was going to have to last me a while you know so i decided no matter what if i had to let a bill go i would take care of my car
 	
 	
 		right
 		
 
 		yeah because you have to get back and forth
 	
 	
 		you know no matter what
 		yeah and i get good gas mileage and it's just been a great car it's i'm i'm real pleased with it i have no no qualms about and i wouldn't mind buying another one if i had to you know the
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah well that sounds good because you know <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hyundai</ENAMEX> is a fairly new car
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		compared to you know <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> and everybody so i i didn't know anyone that had one that's good to hear
 	
 	
 		there's a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lemmon Avenue</ENAMEX> that have them i think a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> walked across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> but uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh there's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a couple</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that have gone <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred thousand</NUMEX> miles on theirs and it's still in good shape so and yet i know someone that had to have a valve job on their valves and that's <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about six seven hundred dollars</NUMEX> but they didn't take it in and have it serviced when they were supposed to
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 		oh um-hum
 	
 	
 		and you know and i do that i think if you take good care of your <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> you know i've got <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> a little over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">two thousand miles</NUMEX> on mine how much how many miles do you have on yours
 	
 	
 		that's about what i have <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty two or thirty four</TIMEX> i can't remember i just turned over
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one one</NUMEX> or the other
 	
 	
 		do you have the oil changed a lot and everything
 	
 	
 		yeah luckily my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> is real good at that and he knows how and he changes it regularly and gives it tune ups you know replaces the spark plugs and
 		and uh yeah i know that
