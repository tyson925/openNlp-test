 		maybe a higher grade one maybe the the economics and the payback of having <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> at a business is a little bit better than having <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> at home and i've read a few articles that uh
 		where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have nice uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three eighty six</NUMEX> machines and nice graphics and the nice software packages and then when they come home they they just can't stand to come down to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">X T</ENAMEX> level and and don't like the
 		the slowness or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">the</NUMEX> in some cases not even having a hard drive and that's pretty much where i fall into i use a a relatively nice array of machines at work for scientific purposes and i have
 		a variety of of uh speeds and complexity of machines depending upon the instrument that it's controlling
 		and then i have one that i do just general purpose work on and then for the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> i don't have anything uh not that i wouldn't want <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> but i
 		would probably not be satisfied with anything less than a really nice <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> and that's that's a quite an expense and then all the software tends to be uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		commercial grade it's all where i guess you know to get something like WordPerfect you're looking at uh <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">five hundred dollars</NUMEX> worth or so
 		and some of the accounting packages or the the nicer spreadsheets are somewhat expensive and i don't know it's it's quite a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a</TIMEX>
 		expense or a luxury for the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> i guess and there's not a whole lot i would do other than some word processing i i got a
 		a number of things that i could could be doing on a PC instead of here instead of doing them at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> at work they're for the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> but i do them on occasion at work and it's nice to uh it would be nice to have one i guess what do you think
 	
 	
 		i share your your uh sense when you change job to work or job to home uh the way your your image of the machine changes i tend to do slightly different things at home than i do at work um
 		i use <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One Two Three</NUMEX> a lot the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lotus</ENAMEX> product as a spreadsheet and i have i use a uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		what you see is what you get <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> for almost all of my word processing so i have not although i have access at home to things like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Works and WordPerfect</ENAMEX> uh
 		but i i do not obviously notice it i i think the thing that surprises me most when i change work to home environment is the cursor speed and after i if initially get over the uh the cursor speed in the sense of moving linearly across the screen
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> as opposed to tabbing
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh i'm a touch typer and i haven't ever really noticed
 		uh differences uh the machine tends to react as fast as i can i use an eighty as a matter of fact use an <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eighty eighty eight</NUMEX> at at home uh which is really old iron
 		uh probably <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten years or so</TIMEX> and and at the office uh i am indeed using a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three eighty six</NUMEX> um
 		i use a PC for a great deal of things in in private life uh i'm a church <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">treasurer</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		and i use the machine a lot on a uh uh data base and financial package that that operates at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church office</ENAMEX> i do some uh volunteer work at home using uh
 		a buttons PC file program that uh is a very simplistic relational data base for labels and things so i guess i would have to say on a home setting i'm probably on
 		the personal computer as much as an hour a day on average at home
 	
 	
 		um well that's good
 	
 	
 		um except i don't have
 		a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> too much about the speed however because most of the applications i find are as fast as i am if not more so and i tend to notice it more when it
 		comes down to an issue of peripherals uh at work i'm used to various batch printing capabilities and uh pretty high-speed output either laser printer uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		or uh machines like uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty eight twenty</TIMEX> high speed
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh APA</ENAMEX> printers and so i get frustrated uh watching things slowly come out upon my matrix printer more so than i do over over access speed um
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i
 		guess that i have gotten to the point where if if i didn't have the personal computer
 		i would be impacted a great deal on the things that i do in my life i'm i'm sure i would probably find ways to return to what i was doing in nineteen <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eighty one</NUMEX> when i
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		got my <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> home computer but it it would be i think a dramatic a dramatic sense of loss on on some items
 	
 	
 		on your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> do you do uh does it do spell correcting or any kind of thesaurus work
 	
 	
 		uh no i have access to uh spell correction uh material i seldom
 		i seldom use it although when i'm at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> and i'm producing work correspondence uh i i run <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about ninety per cent</NUMEX> of my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> work on a mainframe
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh i i execute on a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three eighty six</NUMEX> machine that is attached to the mainframe as a server as a intelligent work station but i use it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		frequently as a dumbhead to get to the mainframe and and there i tend on almost all of my editing and stuff to to be using some fairly powerful
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> and word processors and and wordproof but surprisingly at home and i seldom ever bother uh or worry about it too much uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i guess ultimately i'm not a a horribly bad speller although i have a tendency to lisp when i type so to speak
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh nothing that that's particularly horrible and i think most of the work word processing i do since it's somewhat of a personal nature i've probably don't have a sense of vulnerability
 		in this in in the even that i were to send to to send a a misspelled word out the way one might have at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> place
 	
 	
 		right
 		well i tend to that's one thing i notice the speed difference in when i have a darc document that's maybe <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty or thirty</TIMEX> pages long and i want to
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		search through it for the spelling it takes forever on an old uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">X T</ENAMEX> at at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> point <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven seven</NUMEX> megahertz you know the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the old</TIMEX> old ones and we're looking at uh
 		several minutes worth of time for it to go through and check everything as opposed to a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three eighty six</NUMEX> where i can just you know it flashes through there and then even just file copying i i do some of that every once in awhile and
 		you know if you had <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">forty</NUMEX> files to copy from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> place to another and you're maybe reorganizing some places on the hard drive  i have an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">X T</ENAMEX> at work  oh excuse me
 		i have an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">X T</ENAMEX> at work that takes forever to copy and then i have a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three eighty six</NUMEX> that just you know they're they're gone they're just over there right away
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		and little things like that i i've noticed the speed difference in and i do some graphics uh i haven't done any well i've done a little bit for the for the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> at work but uh if i were to bring it home
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> or have a machine at home i would like to be able to put together small uh brochure type things with the the front page being a little little bit of graphics and the inside being printed in a uh
 		what i would call a booklet form there are some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editors</ENAMEX> that will produce uh the you know print it sideways and and collate it in such a way that this page comes out right so that you can fold all these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight and a half</NUMEX> by elevens and make a little booklet and
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		my i've done that on occasion at at work and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> does some uh teaching you know little bitty <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekend</TIMEX> type teaching for some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> in the area and
 		and she likes to work up little outlines and things in this format and so i do all the work for her at work and it would really be nice to be able to do it here and say is this what you want you know instead of going back and forth <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX> it takes us a little while to get it right
 		but uh i don't know maybe someday we'll uh get around to getting something decent uh
 	
 	
 		that's
 		that's an interesting point i think a the more i as i've thought about
 	
 	
 		to bring home
 	
 	
 		our conversation i realize that one of the things that perhaps causes me not to get a jarring difference between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> locations is that at the office i'm doing work things that in some ways are dissimilar from what i do at home
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> and as a result i don't get the comparative feel
 		uh i suspect if i were coming home and trying to do some of the projects i do at the office i would go crazy on my on my machine uh i haven't tended to play the games and and uh do the applications at work that i do at home so i probably have never been in
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		noticed how wonderful it might be uh i suspect Lotus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One Two Three</NUMEX> and spreadsheet application might be the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> common thread
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">um</ENAMEX> and there i think that even though i'm on an <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eighty eighty eight</NUMEX> at home
 		that the speed is really quite adequate uh and and i consequently don't even really notice uh the the difference between the the fast <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">machine</ENAMEX> and and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eighty eighty eight</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah unless they're tremendously large they're not going to make that much difference
 	
 	
 		right right i i do have some uh retirement modeling that i've done at home that uh tends to crawl uh which on which i've just turned the calculation off in between and a couple of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> that i've
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		built uh for for school purposes that i start in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the evening</TIMEX> and then go to bed and get them <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the next morning</TIMEX> but they would have run <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an hour and a half even</TIMEX> on a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three eighty six</NUMEX> machine i imagine so
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um
 	
 	
 		i suspect that what happens is that uh you get to the point where it's so long that uh from a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">human being</ENAMEX> perspective there's not much difference between <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">six hours</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an hour and a half</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		that's interesting i hadn't i hadn't run into anything quite that long or fortunately there
