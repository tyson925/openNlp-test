 
     		
 	
 		okay so what kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> are you looking at
 	
 	
 		well we've uh we've we've test driven the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oldsmobile Delta</ENAMEX> eighty <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cutlass Supreme</ENAMEX> and a used <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cadillac</ENAMEX> about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three or four years old</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		because uh
 		i get married in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of weeks</TIMEX> and i have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fiancee</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> so we need we need a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> that's big enough for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">six</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and so that we went i guess it was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weekends ago</TIMEX> we went uh car shopping and looked around uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		we found something interesting at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crest Oldsmobile Cadillac</ENAMEX> up there on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central</ENAMEX> Expressway
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		that uh
 		in addition to to getting a new car there they can get you a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> that's new but it's been uh a demonstrator model
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		for uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">three thousand dollars</NUMEX> even cheaper than the best deal they can give you
 		for a new car
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so they call this program <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> and they come with a new car warranty
 		and it just seems to make sense to me to get the most <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> for your money to get something like that
 	
 	
 		right that's a real good deal in fact my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> recently got a um
 		a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pontiac</ENAMEX> uh believe <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">six thousand</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and he got a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a demo</NUMEX> and it's been a real good car and it's it's like new and it only had had very very low mileage on it
 	
 	
 		okay
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		sure
 	
 	
 		and so he i think he got a real good deal of course they're fully loaded usually so it's i think it's a pretty good option
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		yeah i think so too
 	
 	
 		are the uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oldsmobiles</ENAMEX> that you're looking at are they the demos or they used are they new
 	
 	
 		well the the ones that we were test driving were the uh were the new ones there um-hum well now um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		now they may be the demonstrator <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> but that the sales <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reps</ENAMEX> drive around in
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		and then the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cadillac</ENAMEX> is is definitely a used <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> or uh-huh
 	
 	
 		yeah it was in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eighty eight</NUMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> said it'd been on the lot about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> he says it'll probably be gone in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a day</TIMEX> and it's probably gone by now
 	
 	
 		oh no
 	
 	
 		those things go fast
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um
 		uh of course we're we're not we can't consider getting a brand new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cadillac</ENAMEX> because those are <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty twenty five to thirty</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">thousand dollars</NUMEX> but when they're <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three years old</TIMEX> they're the price already drops in half
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so then it becomes uh more realistic
 	
 	
 		right that's what i'm thinking about on my next <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> is do i want to get another brand new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> because last <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> are brand new or do i want to look for a used <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> that's maybe <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two three years old</TIMEX> that but that's you know low mileage and in good shape
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but i just i kind of worry about getting a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> that's that new with low mileage on it because you wonder why did the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> that owned it want to get rid of it is it a lemon or  or is something wrong with it but i guess that's a risk you have to take
 	
 	
 		that's right that's right
 		well you can reduce that risk by uh having the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> checked out i mean you know you you if you're going to look at fifty different <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> you don't want to do this but if you've narrowed it down to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or two
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you can have the car uh uh checked at uh an independent service <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX> and have them go through it from top to bottom and tell you if they can find anything wrong because they don't have any financial interest in it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		right
 	
 	
 		and then you'll have a realistic assessment of what you're getting
 	
 	
 		um-hum about how much do they charge to do something like that do you know
 	
 	
 		oh i'm thinking around <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty or twenty five</TIMEX> dollars
 	
 	
 		yeah that's not bad
 	
 	
 		no huh-uh
 	
 	
 		it'd be well worth it if you're considering buying a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>  to find out yeah
 	
 	
 		i i would i would think so
 	
 	
 		yeah well it's kind of hard for me to talk about buying <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> because i just got mine paid off <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about a month ago</TIMEX> and i yes i don't want to think about buying a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> for a while i just want to enjoy not having any car payments for a while and
 	
 	
 		isn't that a good feeling
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		and enjoy watching my savings account get larger and uh you know hang on to the one i've got for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few years</TIMEX> because it's it's it's almost <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four years old</TIMEX> but it's still in great shape i have a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mazda</ENAMEX> RX7
 	
 	
 		well what you can do is take your <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> payment and put it in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX> for for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three or four years</TIMEX> and when you're ready to get another car just pay cash for it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah i just about could really because i think my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> if i continue taking good care of it it's going to hold a pretty good resale value and uh that if i consider going the used <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> route and save up some money i shouldn't have too much trouble at all
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah i would i would think that's true
 	
 	
 		could you hold on for just a moment okay
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		okay i'm on a cordless phone and i was picking up uh some background noise so i just switched the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> up on it i didn't want to interfere with whatever they're trying to record so  anyway
 	
 	
 		right right that's fine
 	
 	
 		but uh i really i really enjoy the car i have now and i do want to hold onto it and and uh you know enjoy it while it's not having any mechanical problems whatsoever in fact it never has and uh
 	
 	
 		that's right that's right
 	
 	
 		it's been kind of nice and i surprisingly enough after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four years</TIMEX> i'm not tired of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> at all and um
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		i'll just hang on to it while it's still being a good car and while i'm not tired of it and while i'm single and can handle a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> seater for now  and get that out of my system
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		that's right that's right
 	
 	
 		because one of these days i'll be getting a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> seater probably too so  um
 	
 	
 		eventually
 		yeah the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> i ever bought um well uh i've i've bought <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> and i've i've always bought them new <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first</TIMEX> car i kept for thirteen and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a half years</TIMEX> and got <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred and sixty one thousand</NUMEX> out of it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		wow
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> i ever bought i drive to work now that just turned <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten years old</TIMEX> and i've got <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred and twenty two</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">thousand miles</NUMEX> on that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so that that's kind of been the way i've done things is to get things that are new and then keep them forever
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> is is using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> quarts of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> a week now
 	
 	
 		oh my gosh
 	
 	
 		<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about about a quart every hundred miles</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh no
 	
 	
 		so uh but but uh it runs fine all you have it's just very thirsty if i just keep the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> in it seems to be okay but you know that's a sign that i'm going to have to do something sooner or later
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah
 		right what kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> is it
 	
 	
 		it's a a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buick Century</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um-hum are you going to trade it in on this new one or
 	
 	
 		uh no my fiance is selling uh a nineteen seventy <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cutlass Supreme</ENAMEX> that she has it's actually in better condition than my car
 	
 	
 		okay
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and so she's going to get some money for that and take some money from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX> and then try to make as much down payment as possible to keep the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</TIMEX> payment low
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		so she's going to sell it rather than trade it in that's probably the best thing
 	
 	
 		yeah um you you lose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">six hundred dollars</NUMEX> a trade in
 	
 	
 		or maybe more than that as i've learned  yeah when i bought my RX7 i uh best offer i got for my other <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty five hundred</TIMEX> well i turned around and sold it myself for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">forty two hundred</NUMEX> so
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		oh there you go
 	
 	
 		you can do much better i'm glad you're you're taking care of it yourself i i think trading it in they just use that as additional they may give you supposedly a better deal on your new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> you're buying but they just are going to give you that much less for your trade in
 	
 	
 		well that's fact
 	
 	
 		that's what i think so
 	
 	
 		i think you're right
 	
 	
 		but strangely enough the best offer i mean the best bargaining i had made with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealer</ENAMEX> on my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> was also the same place i got the best price
 	
 	
 		interesting
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trade</ENAMEX> in but it's a place in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arlington</ENAMEX> and i think maybe as you get outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> area i kind of i bet you it's kind of what i decided well maybe because it's outside of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> they are giving a little bit better
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		prices plus i was going through that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">fleet</ENAMEX> discount program
 	
 	
 		the okay did you did you use it  the car <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX> place
 	
 	
 		um well it's before they had that
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		i had gone over to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texins</ENAMEX> and they had a little file where they said which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX> participated in the in the fleet program and what you could expect they said you know a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> percent
 	
 	
 		that's right yeah
 	
 	
 		over cost and then options at cost and everything so i figured out a price based on that
 	
 	
 		right right
 		yeah that's good
 	
 	
 		but i i guess i got a pretty good deal because i went back to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Town North Mazda</ENAMEX> right off central and offered them the same price as what i knew i was gonna be able to get it for in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arlington</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		right
 	
 	
 		and they said there is no way you can get this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> for that price especially if we add on the equalizer and the and the cruise control he said you're going to get a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> that's got flood damage or hail damage and they just laughed at me
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		and i went <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the next morning</TIMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arlington</ENAMEX> and they gave it to me for that price and what's so funny is they took the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> they i knew they were gonna pull it from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Town North</ENAMEX> because that's where the white one was and they had already told me we located one at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Town North</ENAMEX> so it was that same car
 	
 	
 		is that right
 		my gosh
 	
 	
 		and i said like yeah well unless you're selling <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> with hail damage and flood damage  i got the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> off your <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lot</ENAMEX> for that price
 	
 	
 		and you and you laughed all the way to the bank
 	
 	
 		oh i did and i laughed real hard when i took it in for the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">two thousand mile</NUMEX> checkup and uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		that they required you to do and i took it to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Town North</ENAMEX> and sure enough i saw that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> and he recognized me he said he said oh hi <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dana</ENAMEX> and he kind of looked down and saw that car and i'm and i'm sure he probably knew what was going on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the very next day</TIMEX> of course when when the place in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arlington</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		went and took the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> because i told him there's a place in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arlington</ENAMEX> that's gonna give it to me for that price he said no they're not and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next day</TIMEX> they
 	
 	
 		that's right
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		pulled the white <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> and took it to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arlington</ENAMEX> so i'm sure he knew  so i loved it i sat there and i just had the biggest grin on my face
 	
 	
 		such a deal
 		i'll bet you did
 	
 	
 		is kind of nice but
 	
 	
 		well <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dana</ENAMEX> it's been really interesting and i appreciate talking with you
 	
 	
 		yeah good talking to you too <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Don</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		okay have a good <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		okay good luck in your <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> hunting uh-huh bye-bye
 	
 	
 		thank you much bye
