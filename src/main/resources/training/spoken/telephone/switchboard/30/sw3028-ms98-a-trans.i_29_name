 		she didn't announce that to you
 	
 	
 		oh i didn't i didn't quite hear all of it
 	
 	
 		oh i see that's fine um i think uh that's pleasurable for all of us  if we  choose the right restaurant
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		
 
 		so what are your thoughts on dining out
 	
 	
 		well i i really choose <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> more for the quality of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> than anything else
 	
 	
 		not for the price
 	
 	
 		well a little bit for the price but uh i think that as far as quality of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> goes the most some of the most expensive places i've been had the the really the the worst quality of food
 	
 	
 		okay
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		the
 		really okay
 	
 	
 		really um a lot of places that even don't look don't look like much some of the some of the best food i have ever had was out of a outside or inside of a place that we drove up and i was like
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i'm not eating in there  are you nuts and uh we went in and it was the most it was the most wonderful food
 	
 	
 		
 
 		my word it's like mama in the back <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen</ENAMEX> huh
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm serious
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		um a lot of
 		uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> place that we went just recently uh was to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atchafalaya</ENAMEX> no that's not right that's not right that's not right  what's the name of that restaurant
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 		okay
 	
 	
 		the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hari Krishna</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kalachandji</ENAMEX>'s it's all vegetarian and it was just fabulous i mean my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> was aghast because i ate turnip <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">greens</ENAMEX> and liked it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">wow</ENAMEX> and where was that at
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">um Kalachandji</ENAMEX>'s it's uh it's a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hari Krishna</ENAMEX> run restaurant
 	
 	
 		where is it in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		is it in the phone book
 	
 	
 		uh i think so it should be
 	
 	
 		do you know how to spell it
 	
 	
 		uh it starts with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">okay Kalli K A L L I</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K A L</ENAMEX> A i think C H A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N D</ENAMEX>
 		that should get you close enough to
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		to be able to find it i think it's uh probably listed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> you know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh</ENAMEX> section yes uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but it's uh it's just fabulous food
 	
 	
 		what about fast foods do you have a preference if you were going to eat a fast food
 	
 	
 		well we like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arby</ENAMEX>'s
 	
 	
 		you do like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arby's</ENAMEX> see i don't like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arby</ENAMEX>'s
 	
 	
 		as far as fast food goes oh really why
 	
 	
 		no because they use everything they can and make this into pressed whatever they use the they use the insides of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> heart and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> and they they form it and they make it look like roast <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beef</ENAMEX> and i said no thank you
 	
 	
 		oh no no no someone has been lying to you what they use is roast <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beef</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		well that's not what i heard from one of somebody that was supposed to know what they were talking about
 	
 	
 		that's what
 		oh my goodness
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i'm surprised my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> worked for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arby's</ENAMEX> for several years
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		unless somebody is trying to blackball them
 	
 	
 		well that's happened before but we like good uh we we're we like <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> food
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		okay
 	
 	
 		and stuff like that so um
 	
 	
 		how about the health food uh restaurants
 		well like this one but it's probably not advertised as such is it
 		or
 	
 	
 		a health food
 	
 	
 		uh-huh health food uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> that
 	
 	
 		like like name one  i'm not sure what you're talking about
 	
 	
 		well
 		well like um
 		well i can't really think of any off the top of my head right now because there's so few and far between but they ought there are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> that cater to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that are very health conscious
 		you know as far as their cholesterol levels and their their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fat</ENAMEX> content and you know the amount of calcium and so forth that are in each product and they list them now there's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX> that does that and it's called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rodolfo</ENAMEX>'s over on
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Preston Road</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Lane</ENAMEX> i believe and they  have very good <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> over there
 	
 	
 		hum
 		i don't guess i've ever been to anything like that so i really don't have anything to compare it to
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh uh</ENAMEX>-huh they do list um you know list the fat
 	
 	
 		it would be good i think uh i don't know how expensive they are it sounds like that it would probably
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		well it was pretty reasonable i it was around <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> dollars for lunch
 		okay which which is kind of high for lunch i guess
 	
 	
 		for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		yes uh-huh yeah
 	
 	
 		a bit
 	
 	
 		uh but um
 		you were served by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">maitre</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">d</ENAMEX>'s and and uh um
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men waiters</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		see i i won't really be interested in going to going there because i feel like i'm i'm paying you know <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">five dollars</NUMEX> for the food probably and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">five dollars</NUMEX> for something that i could get along quite well without
 	
 	
 		well if you're looking for a nice
 		uh-hum well i guess if you were having if you were trying to impress somebody like taking somebody that you hadn't seen for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a long time</TIMEX> and wanted to show them a good <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX> it's a special occasion type thing yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah maybe maybe that yeah
 		yeah i could see that then maybe
 	
 	
 		uh-hum
 		and now the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Red Lobster i</ENAMEX> found is very nice at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">lunchtime</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah i like the the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seafood</ENAMEX> that they when they had it you know the broiled
 	
 	
 		because they're
 		well they have lunch specials that you can't you can't beat that price uh if you went to a cafeteria
 	
 	
 		yeah probably that's true but i know a lot of their a lot of their specials sometimes are fried things that you can't really get away from the fried
 	
 	
 		well i had the i had a broiled <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chicken</ENAMEX> breast and it was excellent
 		it was a marinated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">broiled chicken</ENAMEX> breast and it was excellent
 	
 	
 		now why would you go to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">seafood restaurant</ENAMEX> to eat <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chicken</ENAMEX> that's one of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>'s pet <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">peeves</ENAMEX> he doesn't understand why somebody would go to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">seafood place</ENAMEX> and eat either <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chicken</ENAMEX> or steak you know
 	
 	
 		oh it was
 		well i've never had catfish either in a
 		restaurant because i'm from the north and that was a no no and i haven't gotten over that from the north
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		oh <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">catfish</ENAMEX> is wonderful oh really
 	
 	
 		i know they say that that is but i'm
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		but they've got all these caution signs now on fish
 		and so i kind of stay away because of all the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pollution</ENAMEX> in the lakes and the
 	
 	
 		why
 		oh
 	
 	
 		everywhere i mean there isn't any safe haven anymore for fish
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		i and especially uh in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wisconsin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Michigan</ENAMEX> they say don't buying of our fish
 	
 	
 		that's too bad because i'm probably not going to stop eating it
 	
 	
 		i
 		
 
 		well
 		yeah so you i
 		and the the best brand of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chicken</ENAMEX> to buy is the uh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pilgrim</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pride</ENAMEX> because they don't use all these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormones</ENAMEX> to promote uh unnatural growth in their products
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh yeah</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so i mean we have to be on the lookout if we want to stay healthy
 	
 	
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		so i'm i you know i
 	
 	
 		oh on one hand i see that and on the other hand uh my older sister
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		remembers when uh at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> point they were taking radioactive wastes
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and storing them in tin barrels which i i guess had a half-life of oh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five years</TIMEX> if they sit empty on dry land
 	
 	
 		corrode
 		hum
 	
 	
 		so they're putting radioactive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waste</ENAMEX> in it which reduces it dramatically and then they take these things that will rust and they throw them in the ocean which is going to speedup the process even more
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		well i'd like to get ahold of some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineers</ENAMEX> and knock their heads together if it would do any good
 	
 	
 		oh and then they wouldn't sink they were floating around so they shot holes in them to sink them and this is before i was born
 	
 	
 		oh dear
 		wow
 	
 	
 		so i mean we're taking <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty years ago</TIMEX> this happened and
 	
 	
 		sure yeah
 	
 	
 		and who's you know the tuna is radioactive
 	
 	
 		that's right everything we eat everything
 	
 	
 		to a certain extent you can't get away from it so i think
 	
 	
 		everything we eat should have a label on it  yeah
 	
 	
 		to some point yeah you know so there's you know there's some things i think we can avoid we you know we can't avoid for health purposes and some things that we just need to like you know this is not in my control
 	
 	
 		well you know
 	
 	
 		so i'm either going to be i'm either going to starve to death or i'm going to get over it and just go ahead and eat as healthily as i possibly can you know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		well Becky you know even if you lived off your own land that you would have to put caution signs
