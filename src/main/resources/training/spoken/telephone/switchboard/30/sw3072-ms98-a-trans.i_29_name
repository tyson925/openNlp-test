 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		okay where have you all been on vacation recently
 	
 	
 		recently my most recent trip was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> and that was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Detroit</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Detroit</ENAMEX> is that a nice vacation spot
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well it wasn't really it was um uh to see an old relative
 	
 	
 		right okay
 	
 	
 		and it was uh just to uh
 		have some fellowship with her
 	
 	
 		right so you probably wouldn't recommend that as tourist big tourist spot
 	
 	
 		no The only thing that i i visited that you know is quite a tourist spot is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cancun Mexico</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		ooh that would be nice
 	
 	
 		and that was real nice uh
 	
 	
 		did you scuba dive there
 	
 	
 		uh no we just kind of walked the beaches and looked at all the beautiful scenery there
 	
 	
 		ooh that would be nice
 	
 	
 		yeah and just kind of relaxed and
 		unwound a little bit from our <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> routine
 	
 	
 		oh that would be enjoyable
 		right yeah that's a nice break i haven't been on vacation in a while either um usually when we go we go to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colorado</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Estes Park</ENAMEX> area which is up kind of near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Denver</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		huh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yes
 	
 	
 		and uh stay in the mountains up there do a little hiking and resting get away from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> heat that kind of thing
 	
 	
 		oh that's always refreshing to get away from
 	
 	
 		so it's a lot of fun i worked up there <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last summer</TIMEX> so i guess it was kind of like a vacation the whole <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">summer long</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh well that's nice yeah
 	
 	
 		worked at a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camp</ENAMEX> there and so i got to
 		spend a lot of time up in the mountains
 		so that's probably my favorite place when i have to go somewhere
 		on a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">vacation</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		well my uh my middle <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> and her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> have just taken up a new activity and that's canoeing
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and uh they've been to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Guadalupe River</ENAMEX> and they also uh
 		uh have been to uh i guess <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colorado</ENAMEX> and they've really enjoyed it it's a whole new
 	
 	
 		that's nice we um we canoed up in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arkansas</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Buffalo River</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and that's the best place that i've ever canoed it was really
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		really pretty i was a little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX> then and we to have uh we stayed at some <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> and they had a little uh mountain <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who came down the river <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">every night</TIMEX> and he would give a little talk about
 		
 
 		mountain things you know i think he wasn't a real mountain <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> but we were pretty convinced he was a full hermit who lived up in
 	
 	
 		sure
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		the woods that he'd come in his little log <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> down the river and we would have to we'd  and he'd make <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sassafras tea</ENAMEX> out of sassafras roots that he'd found and
 	
 	
 		oh that's neat
 	
 	
 		that's that's a good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> place to go and then the river was really nice because it wasn't too
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		frightening but it wasn't
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know
 		too easy either
 		so it was like
 	
 	
 		well you learn a lot of um skills too and
 		i think you're more receptive when you're younger than when you're older to learn new skills and i think they really it really penetrates penetrates in your memory you know what to do because you really have a great interest in it
 	
 	
 		that's true
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		because it's something you weren't forced to do
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		so you have kind of a relaxed mode of learning and you're more receptive
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well that's good well we um let's see the only other place i've ever vacationed we'd you know go on camping trips up to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texoma</ENAMEX> and things like that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and then i went to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh that's exciting
 	
 	
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few years ago</TIMEX> i was a student there and spent um a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">semester</TIMEX> studying abroad in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and that was a great time because it's so that's such a neat place and it's there's not a language barrier so you don't i mean there
 		there's a little bit because there's some of those <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> words that you just don't
 		exactly know what they mean and a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have trouble wrestling with their accents but it's
 		it was really fun i i i really enjoyed that i'm probably going back there to work for a year
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		well i had a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> that uh visited <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX> not
 		well i think it's been probably <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</TIMEX> now but that's her next goal and she can do it is go back to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX> because she really
 		has a great desire to do that because the love that she um has for it now after visiting it
 	
 	
 		it it's really nice i would i would spend all my time in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> or most of my time and that's it was really different being in a big <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> because i don't
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		get much into  urban you know really urban areas a lot
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and it was it's really it's sort of a weird little anonymous feeling where no one knows who you are and you can spend a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">whole day</TIMEX> without talking to anyone which i thought i would just hate but it ended up being kind of nice because you're not accountable to anyone
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you could just kind of
 	
 	
 		do your own thing
 	
 	
 		kind of walk around and observe i did a lot of just going out by myself and riding on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">subway</ENAMEX> and watching watching people
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i had a great time doing that
 		it was really interesting
 	
 	
 		that's wonderful
 		there's a lot out there to see i'll say
 	
 	
 		yeah i know i  keep wanting to get up to i haven't i haven't been anywhere else outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> i haven't been to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> or Canada
 		or
 	
 	
 		well i lived across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> almost from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so that was that that's a nice place <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> is very nice
 	
 	
 		yeah that would be nice i had a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> from there then i i'd love to go somewhere in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX> but i'd have to have a
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 		tour guide with me to
 	
 	
 		oh yes absolutely
 	
 	
 		help with all the language and all that
 	
 	
 		sure somebody that knows their way around
 	
 	
 		so yeah that's why that's why <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX> was nice even we traveled in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about a week</TIMEX> and that was even nice because there wasn't uh the most the places we went we went to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Switzerland</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		well you've been quite a few places there
 	
 	
 		well i yeah we  have we just kind of
 	
 	
 		
 
 		once you think about it huh
 	
 	
 		we did we whirlwinded through <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> it was
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		just insane twelve <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> where we'd just stop like a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> a day and you slept on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh that's great
 	
 	
 		but there wasn't a it was strange it was kind of sad there wasn't ever a language problem there because everyone in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> knew <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> and everyone in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Switzerland</ENAMEX> knew English
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		that's great
 	
 	
 		so  we were kind of pitiful we found <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX> we were in and got seated and then no on e knew <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> in there and we were just
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		finally had to break out the phrase book and start looking up things but it was uh
 	
 	
 		what did you wind up with
 	
 	
 		oh i had fondue that was easy to say
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		
  
 		tried to get fondue and white <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> and that was
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		we were able to have that pretty pretty effortlessly there were some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> at the next table who spoke <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> so we
 	
 	
 		they kind of guided you
 	
 	
 		elicited their aid for a while and they were
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		very helpful so
 	
 	
 		well good
 	
 	
 		it was
 		it was a pleasant time i'd i'd love to go back there
 		there's just not time
 		there's not enough time to go see everything and then to afford to see everything
 	
 	
 		i guess that's why we need to plan for retirement so when we do have the free time we'll have the the means to uh pursue our dreams
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		yeah i guess that's what retirement is all about
 	
 	
 		that's
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		that and sleeping late
 	
 	
 		Yes
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i keep hoping for
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh i understand that huh
 	
 	
 		well
 		it was nice talking with you
 	
 	
 		well it was nice talking with you too <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Craig</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and have a good <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX>
