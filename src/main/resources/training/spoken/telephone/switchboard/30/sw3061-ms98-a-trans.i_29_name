 		yes
 	
 	
 		they might be as old i'm not sure  yeah
 	
 	
 		kind of lose track  well that's interesting because we have a similar we don't have <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> but we do have a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> who is an indoor <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> and she is going to be thirteen <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this summer</TIMEX> so yes uh-huh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh is that right what kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> do you have
 	
 	
 		um she's um a mix of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cockapoo Cocker Cocker Spaniel</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poodle</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh that's what ours is  yes
 	
 	
 		is that right isn't that interesting  what color is your dog
 	
 	
 		white
 	
 	
 		oh  well ours is black so  definitely different  yes she's a female and she's um been she's been a really a really good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">companion</ENAMEX> for me um she's like a little shadow you know kind of follows me around all the time and
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh i'll be darned
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and um she's slowing down considerably she doesn't hear very well and she doesn't see very well but she's yeah at this age i guess so
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		well that's to be expected at their age
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but um she's been a good <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> to have and i don't know once she's gone i'm not sure if i'll get another animal or not
 	
 	
 		well everybody always says no more  but i i think <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> are really important in the family i
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		i agree yes um did you get yours as a pet for your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> do you have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh yeah we have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> ah
 	
 	
 		uh-huh oh well i was wondering if you got your <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> originally as a pet for them or just because you'd had dogs before or
 	
 	
 		well we have had we had had a a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> before she was fifteen when she died and uh this one we bought by accident a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmer</ENAMEX> called us and wanted us to call the animal shelter to come or the dog catcher or somebody to come and get this
 	
 	
 		my goodness
 		uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">puppy</ENAMEX> that somebody <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> drop things like that off up there and i said gee she sounds like a cute little <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> i told the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> let's go look at her
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah uh-huh
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		go get her so that's how we got her quite by accident
 	
 	
 		isn't that
 		yes so that often happens that way well we had um intentionally um planned to get a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> we had just moved into this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and um decided to wait a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about a year</TIMEX> and then went then we went out then and found one she was in the litter and um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		she was so cute because  all the other little <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">puppies</ENAMEX> in that litter were just crazy i mean they were all over the place and she was real docile and came over and just kind of sat next to us and i thought that's the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> for me
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		oh
 		oh she picked us
 	
 	
 		yeah so she and it what was funny was that um our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> must have been let's see she must have been <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about eight</NUMEX> at the time i guess and um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		she just loved this little <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> to pieces but i think she loved her too much because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> has never been real comfortable with her i think she was always a little bit leery of her
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> on the other hand who was about <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eleven</NUMEX> at the time was um not very interested in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pets</ENAMEX> but as it turned out he and this <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> have gotten to be really good pals
 	
 	
 		oh for heaven's sake
 	
 	
 		so you just never know how that works out
 	
 	
 		no but they say it's real important for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> to have <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pets</ENAMEX> because uh well they can go and talk to them any time they want to and tell them anything they want to and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yes
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		nobody is going to you know reprimand them or know their secrets or
 	
 	
 		that's right
 		that yes they're very unjudgmental  oh dear
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yes
 		and the nursing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> now they're finding that it's real important to take a pet into a nursing home
 	
 	
 		yes i have been i have been reading and seeing about that on television uh-huh and how
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 		our one our <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> nursing home in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brooksville</ENAMEX> has one
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		permanent
 	
 	
 		is that right
 	
 	
 		he he kind of has free run of the place and there is somebody or somebody takes care of him
 	
 	
 		isn't that amazing
 	
 	
 		but he goes up and down the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">halls</ENAMEX> visiting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and real nice dog uh and uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yes it's funny how um how <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pets</ENAMEX> can kind of um oh take on a certain status in certain areas i mean um that made me think of uh when our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> was looking at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">colleges</ENAMEX> we visited a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">campus</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">um Saint Louis</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um there were several <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">campus</ENAMEX> and and the what was interesting about it was that they were very friendly but they didn't appear to belong to anyone and um i'm sure someone you know fed them they were healthy looking dogs
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh really
 		oh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but um our guide <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that day</TIMEX> said that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX> one woman <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many many years ago</TIMEX> had given a huge sum of money to to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">university</ENAMEX> on the condition that there be <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">um dogs</ENAMEX> just kind of left to roam around around the campus
 	
 	
 		is that right
 	
 	
 		which is the strangest thing i had ever heard
 	
 	
 		yeah because most campuses don't allow <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pets</ENAMEX> you know they just do not allow them
 	
 	
 		i know
 		yes i know it
 	
 	
 		that's that's kind of great
 	
 	
 		yes it really was it was just a nice touch and it kind of made it seem more homy too  but um the i thought that was most unique and it just you know kind of goes along with what you were saying about the dog having sort of free run of the the nursing home
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yes yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so um but uh i this is the only pet we've had since you know in all our years of marriage um and it's been uh sort of a a change for my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> because as a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a</NUMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> growing up
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> had dogs but they were always hunting <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> and so they were never allowed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> you know they were always kind of yeah right  that's what he said yes so having a pet was a little bit different for him
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh uh</ENAMEX>-huh yeah we've ruined them  they say they'll ruined them
 		well we've had a lot of different <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pets</ENAMEX> we had
 		the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> had rabbits for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pets</ENAMEX> and we also raised them for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah oh yes
 	
 	
 		and we've had it we've had a skunk for a pet
 	
 	
 		oh my golly
 	
 	
 		for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more years</TIMEX> than i want to think about  she was in the house
 	
 	
 		oh gosh isn't that interesting i don't think i've ever talked to anyone who's actually had a skunk for a pet  oh
 	
 	
 		well don't don't ever get one for a pet  they're okay but like she uh they don't ever learn their name
 	
 	
 		ah
 	
 	
 		uh you can't you could never call her and she would come to you you had to go chas e her down
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i'll be darned how interesting
 	
 	
 		and uh their eyesight they can't see very far either but
 	
 	
 		uh-huh i guess i've heard that uh-huh
 	
 	
 		they they before before we got her everybody said oh they're just like a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> you know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh they're not  i mean they use the litter box that's about it as far as
 	
 	
 		
 
 		isn't that interesting that's that's really something um how long did you have that
 	
 	
 		oh my how how long
 		probably <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eight years</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		goodness sake
 	
 	
 		and finally my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> are the ones who said <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mom</ENAMEX> you've put up with that skunk long enough so  we moved her to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">basement</ENAMEX> and i don't think she was there a week till the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> moved
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		built built her a pen outside  and i thought i put up with that all those years
 	
 	
 		oh my gosh Isn't that funny
 		yes and this is what it took finally  that is
 	
 	
 		and we've had we've had cats <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> stay in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> we had we had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Siamese cats</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>

 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		different times
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh one of them ran off she ran off once or he i guess it was a male he ran off twice and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> time he never came back
 	
 	
 		my goodness
 	
 	
 		and we would see him uh <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">several miles</NUMEX> from our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> he kind of moved into a woods down there and he got huge down there
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		i'll be
 		my goodness
 	
 	
 		he really grew but he he never came back
 	
 	
 		that's interesting
 		that's interesting i i wouldn't picture a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Siamese</ENAMEX> as being an <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">outdoor cat</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		well he wasn't a whole lot he was in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> most the time but uh he did go out sometimes and uh they make it makes a much nicer <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> if they're outside
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 		is that right
 	
 	
 		yeah the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">the cats</ENAMEX> my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> has a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vet</ENAMEX> had told us they get strange if they're kept in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX> all the time and their <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat uh</ENAMEX> was not a friendly <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> it was
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>

 		it was not a good
