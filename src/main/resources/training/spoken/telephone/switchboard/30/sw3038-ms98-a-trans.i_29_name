 		okay
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">okay China Cry</ENAMEX> was basically the the true story written by this this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX> who had uh
 		was a native is native <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> uh
 		uh who was raised by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> and her her time frame was prior to the nineteen <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">forty nine</NUMEX> revolution
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		i see
 	
 	
 		although she herself had never really
 		accepted <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus</ENAMEX> or gone through any of the other uh <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> uh
 		portions of of the faith repentance <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">baptisms et cetera et cetera</ENAMEX> she had always felt a very strong uh
 		leaning in this direction and whenever the cultural revolution of nineteen <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">forty nine</NUMEX> occurred
 		and most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX> were either banned or their all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clergy</ENAMEX> and so forth were ah killed or or imprisoned or and the property confiscated
 		she was safe because she had you know not officially joined the the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> movement
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so
 		anyway she as she grew up towards maturity her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> well her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> and and he was rather well you know rather well to do in the old regime
 		and the the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> the communist the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">communist Chinese</ENAMEX> didn't like this at all
 		you know the bourgeoisie was was was definitely out of uh style then
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		everybody was back to a commonality of one
 		and so they kept picking at him picking at his at her mother
 		and uh finally
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">uh</ENAMEX> started picking on her
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and getting her to you know they were starting to uh
 		accuse her of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">of</NUMEX> of uh
 		crimes and atrocities before the the revolution and and had her write her own story over and over and over
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> and the uh the major point of the movie was that that she had
 		uh married this this <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> fellow
 		and was with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> when they started this mass <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> now i think i'm leaving out a portion she graduated she went through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">college</ENAMEX> and graduated
 		very high up in her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> and had uh gotten a job as as an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">instructor</ENAMEX> and they had her teaching or were starting to have her teach history for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		when the they decided that that she needed to start recanting of all of her pre uh regime crimes as it were being a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> you know so
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		they kept on and on at at her and in the meantime she and her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> uh were expecting expecting were expecting a child their own child
 		and uh the the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> kept harassing her over you know over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a period of months</TIMEX> and finally
 		they uh carried her
 		uh out into the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courtyard</ENAMEX> to to either really to shoot her or to go through the motions of of
 		shooting her uh with by firing or you know executing her by firing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">squad</ENAMEX> and uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lord</ENAMEX> just said no this is not going to happen even though this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX> has not really
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know she's she's one of mine she is not going to die and um
 		the the the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX> were blinded when they shot
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		and she her life was spared
 		and this this frightened the the uh
 		the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commandant</ENAMEX> and so he called this kind of stuff off and just put her in the labor camp
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		well uh

 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">uh</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bureaucracy bureaucracy</ENAMEX> that they finally let her go

 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> and i had this great desire to go see a comedy and

 		Green Card
 	
 	
 		Green Card and and uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		he chose it and uh it's got this wonderful <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actor</ENAMEX> who's
 		it was his like his and he's been a star in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> and a wonderful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actor</ENAMEX> who we've enjoyed for years
 		but he's never made an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">film</ENAMEX> this was his <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">film</ENAMEX> debut and he speaks very broken English
 	
 	
 		oh i see uh-huh

 		uh in a marriage of convenience
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so that he could get his green card which is what an alien needs to work in this country

 		and uh because she could claim she was married she could get uh an <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> or a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">condominium</ENAMEX> in a very exclusive
 		building in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> that had a garden an an an outside garden which is very unusual there
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		because she was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">horticulturist</ENAMEX> and that was sort of her dream of course you know they got married and they never saw each other again except except fate threw them together and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Immigration and national Naturalization Service</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh i see uh-huh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">um</ENAMEX> started investigating so they had to get back together and get their stories straight
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and and she was a very sophisticated well sophisticated
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">urban New Yorker</ENAMEX> and he was a poor <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Frenchman</ENAMEX> who had grown up on the
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> and sort of pulled himself up by his bootstraps and claimed to be a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">composer</ENAMEX> but there was no proof whatsoever that he really was
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		he'd been working in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX> when they met
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		they had to learn all about each other basically in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a in a weekend</TIMEX> and uh it was you knew what was going to happen of course
 	
 	
 		just a minute
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		that they would fall in love well they fell into like at any rate and
 	
 	
 		right uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and when they went to the
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">query</ENAMEX> or inquisition or whatever
 		uh they did perfectly and then he said something because his <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> was so poor on for the most part he
 		he was so proud of himself for giving examples all the correct answers that
 		that on the last one he said oh i never remember that answer and that clued the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigator</ENAMEX> that he had memorized a series of answers
 	
 	
 		uh oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so um
