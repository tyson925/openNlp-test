 		well i guess the best i can do is is uh compare <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartments</ENAMEX>  if i can compare the one that i have now with the one that i had the last time the one that i have now uh

 		it was practically new when i moved in here and the carpet was new and

 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh
 		but there's you know there there are a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> but it's just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> stories

 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so tell me about
 	
 	
 		yeah i've always uh been pretty lucky the real estate out here's been pretty good its uh the the prices of well the prices came down <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> we've we had sort of like a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> syndrome  the past uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh year and a half prices have gone down which is totally new for northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX> it just never happened before so it's really surprising everybody  all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">developers</ENAMEX> don't know what to do
 	
 	
 		uh-huh just
 		it's real good
 		yeah it's a good time to buy if you're in the market
 	
 	
 		yeah unfortunately we're uh we actually have our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> on the market because we have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> and we have a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedroom house</ENAMEX> and it's pretty much filled up right now
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		oh so you want a bigger one
 	
 	
 		yeah um-hum get an extra <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedroom</ENAMEX> or a basement right now it's just a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a single</TIMEX> level rambler
 	
 	
 		uh-huh one thing about the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> in uh in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> they don't uh utilize <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">basements</ENAMEX> the way they did in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> had uh
 		a uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> family house
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		actual actually it was a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> family <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> where the the um
 		the downstairs and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX> they had and then they rented the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX> with the whole
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">apartment</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		they had a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">basement</ENAMEX> and they
 		you know they finished the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">basement</ENAMEX> and they were able to rent that out also
 		but uh in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> i i just i i just haven't seen <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">basements</ENAMEX> in houses
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		and i've looked at a lot of them
 	
 	
 		yeah a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> of mine was thinking about coming down there and that's what he said was that you know it just wasn't something that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> had down there they put <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pools</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garages</ENAMEX> on but uh no basements
 	
 	
 		no it's not
 		right
 		i haven't i haven't i have yet to see a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">basement</ENAMEX> in a house
 	
 	
 		hum maybe it's all the sand is there a lot of sand in i always think it's like a desert i don't know   when i think of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> always
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well no  no no no you know i don't see that kind of sand here
 		um
 		there are some areas though where where they have a problem with uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> kind of sinking a little bit into the
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		to the uh or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">foundation</ENAMEX> sinking or something you know just a just a little bit some more than others
 		but you you have to know the right spot to to pick where that doesn't happen and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah well out here we um we live in what used to be uh like a prairie or whatever a natural you know
 		natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grasslands</ENAMEX> and uh they it's just you go down <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">four inches</NUMEX> and you get to sandstone <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">well</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">fourteen inches</NUMEX> you get to sandstone
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and so any place where they put a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">basement</ENAMEX> in they had to blast  it's just solid sandstone
 	
 	
 		i see
 		huh where did you say you're at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colorado</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		no <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX> yeah it's sort of unusual really most of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX> is clay
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia Virginia</ENAMEX> that's right uh-huh anywhere near uh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia Beach</ENAMEX> huh
 	
 	
 		oh yeah uh-huh  yeah my uh my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX> used to live there back before i was born they lived there
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 		well different areas in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> have different kind in uh in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> i'll say because down in east <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> there's a lot of red <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">clay</ENAMEX> and um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		in the in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> you know <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fort Worth</ENAMEX> city areas you don't see that
 	
 	
 		yeah well uh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> is a big <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> so i imagine the the type of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> and uh things like that are truly different from area to area  but uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah well
 	
 	
 		that's the same way out here because um well we for example and we live <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">fifteen miles</NUMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">beltway</ENAMEX> that surrounds <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and anything inside that <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">beltway</ENAMEX> the highway the real estate's <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">forty thousand dollars</NUMEX> more expensive
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so you know you really can't afford i i i could never afford a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> inside the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">beltway</ENAMEX> that's why we came out here this is called the the the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> you know with only you know maybe <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty</TIMEX> miles total from <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DC</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty five</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> but um it's considered the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> since it's uh you know that far out
 		but um yeah we live out by <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Dulles Airport</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		well
 		i see
 	
 	
 		yeah and uh  that's one of the few places still in northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX> they have trailer <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX> that are down around the corner from here and you know it's it's still pretty rural
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh not too much of northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX> is like that anymore land has gotten so expensive they just can't afford to have low income housing like that
 	
 	
 		so is your <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> in an area by itself i mean
 	
 	
 		no we're in a development there's uh yeah there's another <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">one half an acre</NUMEX> away or <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a quarter acre</NUMEX> away rather
 	
 	
 		not connected to another one
 		oh
 		but it's not they're not connected are they uh-huh
 	
 	
 		oh no huh-uh yeah its uh a stand alone single family <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> i sort of got spoiled with that when i was growing up
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks um</ENAMEX> had an <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> for a while when we were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> but um
 		for the most part i they they always had you know and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> always had a single family <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> and so
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know as soon as we could we we got a single family <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> and that's all i ever knew growing up so i stayed in a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">townhouse</ENAMEX> for uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</TIMEX> and then uh saved up enough money to to get a
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
