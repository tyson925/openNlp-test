 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay uh
 	
 	
 		do you have <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> family reunions or
 	
 	
 		uh yeah uh our  the
 		my my my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>'s side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> is quite large or well was quite large at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time and uh  they uh
 		for as long as i can remember have had uh a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yearly</TIMEX> reunion um back uh
 		early on they used to to rotate them from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> from some to
 		to different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> in the family
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		all local were they like all in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh no no not no this was well i am actually from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mississippi</ENAMEX> and so that's it was it was around there generally uh that's where the family
 	
 	
 		oh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		just from city to city then huh
 	
 	
 		grew yeah and it was not only in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mississippi</ENAMEX> in some other places as well so it was uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it it it was a big deal but uh they they tried to to centralize it in one spot so in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past couple of years</TIMEX> they had it at um state <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> every year
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		we rent a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pavilion</ENAMEX> and and do that and that's usually works out to be pretty good uh they will rent a pervilion <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pavilion</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a weekend</TIMEX> and uh
 	
 	
 		do you go back
 	
 	
 		i haven't gone back lately in fact uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this past Sunday</TIMEX> was the uh was the reunion but i didn't get to go uh i have
 	
 	
 		is it choice or just business or
 	
 	
 		not getting to go uh just uh the distance involved and uh just not
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i have a younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> now and uh i it's kind of hard to get her  get her there and everything but i am going to to uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		hopefully <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</TIMEX> get to go back because uh a lot of
 		the family has not uh on her side my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>'s side has not seen you know my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> so
 	
 	
 		oh do you have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brothers</ENAMEX> and sisters
 	
 	
 		i have one <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX> and is your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> still living
 	
 	
 		so
 		yes
 	
 	
 		oh so so you go back and visit with her anyway wouldn't you i mean either way there was <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> reunion time or
 	
 	
 		right yeah
 		right i i usually see her <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a couple</NUMEX> times a year so that's no no
 	
 	
 		or not
 	
 	
 		big thing but uh i uh
 		i do i do enjoy the reunions the only problem is that now um originally originally when we had them uh they were mainly my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>'s
 		uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>'s my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> had quite a few uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> right
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">brothers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sisters</ENAMEX> so it was a large reunion of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">of of</NUMEX> of that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> uh from that descendancy
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh a lot of those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have and and at time you know they all knew one another
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		and now it's gotten uh that uh a lot of those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are died have uh have died off or you know what we are left with is the the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">of</NUMEX> of that group
 	
 	
 		the next generation uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and so uh it's not quite as close as it used to be so i think <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> feel less of a of a desire to really go i know that
 	
 	
 		why why why do you think that it's less close than it used to be
 	
 	
 		well i i just think that uh you know at that time when when they were you know  those were all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brothers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sisters</ENAMEX> a lot and
 		or they were all in the same area geographical location you know back back around you know in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the twenties</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirties</TIMEX> when they were growing up
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um you know they were all located together together in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> small community
 	
 	
 		right right
 		right
 	
 	
 		and as as time grew  i mean when time went on
 		the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> grew and moved away and so forth and now when you when you they come together it's it's generally you know like say the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids kids</ENAMEX> of those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who are not
 		you know anywhere near one another and i don't think they feel the the the closeness that they used to be there
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		which is a shame but that's just how it is my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> was complaining <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> about the you know it's dwindling down <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every year</TIMEX> you know that's just i think that's just
 	
 	
 		is that just <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>'s lack of priority anymore maybe yes
 		that we get so involved in our work lives and
 		just
 	
 	
 		well yeah
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">social</ENAMEX> lives and so forth that
 	
 	
 		yeah that's uh yeah i think that's some of it but you know I
 		i i it's just the way you know i think <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">society society</ENAMEX> is now is that we are not we don't have the extensive family we used to it's more of a you know a smaller
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> and you know we we tend to try to do things i think with with our immediate family as opposed to the extended <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that we may or may not remember or know you know very well uh
 	
 	
 		right right
 		it really makes an effort on to to do this anymore right right
 	
 	
 		right it requires a lot of effort to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">to to</NUMEX> to do that sort of thing i mean i
 		i used to enjoy going i mean i still do kind of enjoy it but uh it's it doesn't it's not as many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> there that i really really enjoy seeing
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		you know i it's going just for the sake of getting together i think for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		do you correspond with anybody other than your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> that's in that group
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		on a regular basis not just <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> cards though
 	
 	
 		um um no not really that in that but then again uh
 		well i you know i have some aunts that uh i i i i do that's about  my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sisters</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know but i feel closer to them because i kind of grew up with them but but uh as for the you know for the rest of that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> no not really
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know and and generally when i was growing up a lot of those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> the only time i ever saw them was at the reunion so uh you do not really feel that
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		that really close to them
 	
 	
 		right in my my uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> we get together  <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every year</TIMEX> at a different location either <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oklahoma City</ENAMEX> they had chosen <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Barbara California</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this summer</TIMEX> and
 		and didn't get enough <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that were willing to go that far because most of us live either in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">midwest</ENAMEX> or like in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas Oklahoma</ENAMEX> area
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		so they canceled that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> and uh are looking <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</TIMEX> bringing it back closer but we have a letter a family letter
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		that circulates and it usually goes through me twice <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> and what you do is take out the last letter you wrote that's on the bottom and put the your new letter on the top
 		and then that's the way it's kept in order and then about twice <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> then you are kept up with what is going on and when you meet them at the reunion
 		you don't feel like i don't know anything about this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> you've you've read something about what is going on and about their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and so forth so you are kind of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> way acquainted that way
 	
 	
 		that's a good idea
 		right
 	
 	
 		and that that's been a that's been a nice way of
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		keeping us all aware of each other i think
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		we tried to start that in my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>'s family his mother's side decided they were going to have a reunion <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of years ago</TIMEX> and i said well let's start this letter
 		and it just never  my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sisters</ENAMEX> started it and sent it to us and that's as far as it got i sent it on to the next <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> and and but we are going in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of weeks</TIMEX> to the next <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Scottsdale Arizona</ENAMEX> for that family
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		we're real glad we got together because since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that that time</TIMEX> there were only like <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister-in-law</ENAMEX> of the original <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> left and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister-in-law</ENAMEX> died and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> is in a nursing home so
 		we are glad that we took that opportunity <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years ago</TIMEX>
