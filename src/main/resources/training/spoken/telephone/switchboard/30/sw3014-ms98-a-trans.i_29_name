 
     		
 	
 		
 
 		are you ready to start okay
 	
 	
 		yes
 		have you recently bought a new car <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Catherine</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well i just found out that my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty months old</TIMEX> and it doesn't seem like it's that old seems like i just bought it
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		it's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an eighty nine</NUMEX> and i bought it uh
 		in uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eighty eight</NUMEX> so yeah
 	
 	
 		well i really i the last <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> we got was a was a used <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> i really don't prefer buying a new car i like to let somebody else pay for that
 	
 	
 		i know i really will do that the next time i buy it too
 	
 	
 		but uh mine was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year old</TIMEX> and we bought it for very functional purposes and that was we bought a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">station wagon</ENAMEX> we wanted an economical car
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		to operate but we wanted one that could carry a lot of equipment
 		so we chose a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Stanza</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">wagon</ENAMEX> and i've never been sorry however the need for that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		oh that's wonderful
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		kind of car
 		has changed now
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		and uh while it is still good and it's quite serviceable and i'll drive it until it no longer is reliable and probably then some  i spend a lot of time praying over it before i give it up
 	
 	
 		um
 		um
 		
 
 		sure
 	
 	
 		i think that i would like to if i you know we all say if i could have the car i always wanted
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i would either buy a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Maxima</ENAMEX>
 		uh i'm sold on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nissans</ENAMEX> i or or or foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> actually uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		but you feel though uh craftsmanship is much superior to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> abilities
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh
 	
 	
 		is that how you i have never
 	
 	
 		its reliability it's reliability
 	
 	
 		its
 	
 	
 		and uh i you know i've read all the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Consumer Reports</ENAMEX> and things and they just run <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> and shoulders above the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> made <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> and the shoulders above it i'd buy a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		isn't that a shame
 	
 	
 		but i had uh had a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Escort</ENAMEX> that absolutely needed taps <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> we got it
 	
 	
 		my word isn't that sorry that's sorry
 	
 	
 		uh you know i mean it was ready for the graveyard and i spent as much on that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> in twelve <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> as i spent for the car
 	
 	
 		my word
 		oh mercy
 	
 	
 		so and that was just trying to hold us getting out of that was a used <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> and it was an older <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> but you know <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Escort</ENAMEX> is supposed to have a great track record
 	
 	
 		you'd
 		um
 		um
 		hm
 		hum
 	
 	
 		as far as sales
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but
 		it's just it just was not  and you get stung a time or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> and you say no thanks so i just trusted the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Consumer Reports</ENAMEX> and the auto
 	
 	
 		sure
 		no thanks that's right
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh reports instead had my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> who knows a lot about that study them thoroughly and he gave me <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> choices of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> to buy an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Escort</ENAMEX> definitely was not among them in fact there wasn't an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> in there
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		wow
 	
 	
 		uh
 		the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> came and and we bought the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> for functional purposes not what the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Consumer Reports</ENAMEX> said we should get
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but it served our needs uh later on his reports the reports that he studied showed that uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> was <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> and shoulders above the rest in the area in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> that we were looking for
 		and that and i'd rather have a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Maxima</ENAMEX> than a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cadillac</ENAMEX>
 		i really would it's not necessarily prestige but it's comfort uh there's a lot of features on there that are desirable if you're going to pay that kind of money for a car uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		who makes that car
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nissan Maxima</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i mean but where are they where are they what what is their location is it uh <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asian</ENAMEX> or is it <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> or who
 	
 	
 		no no no <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nissan Japanese</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh it is <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> okay i didn't know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum um-</ENAMEX>hum yeah and if i couldn't have my luxury <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Maxima</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		then i'd buy me a fancy little red <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CRX</ENAMEX> sports car
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i mean you know every other every one of us have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sides
 	
 	
 		yeah i guess so that's true yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah now what about you if you could have the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> that you wanted
 		what would you get and why
 	
 	
 		if if if i had the car i wanted gee probably um
 	
 	
 		uh-hum
 	
 	
 		uh let's see i like the looks of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lincoln</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Town Car</ENAMEX> but i i don't know the performance of it that's a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> product and you know i would get hung up by my boot straps if i ever if i ever mentioned the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> product in my family
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh yeah</ENAMEX>
 		see there
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i'll tell you that's sad too because at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> was the best that was made
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		really was
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		i i really have not seen now a lot of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> actually are are parts are produced in foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> and assembled here or vice versa
 	
 	
 		can i put you on hold for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one minute</TIMEX> thank you
 	
 	
 		of course
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well that was one minute they hung up
 	
 	
 		okay huh uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh at any rate do you have color preferences or what would be the features that you'd be looking for
 	
 	
 		um
 		well the comfort of a large <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> the the security of a large car
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh
 		and the luxuries of a large car
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> now color preferences i think i would opt to go with a bronze
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		which is probably closest to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gold</ENAMEX> that you can get
 	
 	
 		yeah oh wow we like the stuff that glitters
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		good there's nothing wrong with that actually i think probably if i were going to get uh if i were going to be practical which doesn't mean i would be i would prefer white
 	
 	
 		right well practically yes that's
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		because simply because it's more visible at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		right and it's cooler i believe too when you're driving in
 	
 	
 		and uh-huh um-hum now the interior okay i don't care about the interior just as long as it's not black or red
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 		but if i had the little read CRX i guess the interior would have to be black leather and i'd have to live with that and if i got the CRX it would have to have a real good sound system in it because i'd want that too
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		ah
 	
 	
 		i'd just go back to my teenage <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> and just throw all my experience to the wind
 	
 	
 		um can you uh hang on again
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		thanks
 		
 
 		i've got the phones for lunch hour
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		just don't mind me if i bounce back and forth
 	
 	
 		that's okay
 	
 	
 		um
 		so you like to listen to uh a lot of music or do is it talk shows
 	
 	
 		no no no i generally would prefer uh prefer to listen to
 		uh well i listen to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KCBI</ENAMEX> a lot but i will listen to the news and the and the traffic and those things at work
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but if i'm going to be traveling in that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> for any period of time i want some real good classical music i love classical music and you just can't enjoy it unless you've got a good sound system to produce all the
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		all the yeah um-hum
 	
 	
 		all the characteristics of the instruments
 	
 	
 		um-hum that's true
 	
 	
 		so i do love classical music or at least or or uh contemporary classical
 	
 	
 		do you listen to
 		do you like listen to WRR
 	
 	
 		uh-huh sure do <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WRR</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oasis</ENAMEX> are the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> that i listen to more than anything else and i do like them and
 	
 	
 		uh yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i'd like to have a compact disk <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">player</ENAMEX> in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> that would be something that i would really like those compact disks really are good for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> because they don't melt they don't warp you know there's nothing in there that can wrap around the the uh
 	
 	
 		those are nice aren't they yes those are nice um-hum
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rollers</ENAMEX> or anything it seems seems like a really good answer
 		to portable music that you can choose
