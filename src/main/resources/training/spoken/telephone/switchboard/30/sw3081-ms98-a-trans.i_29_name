 
     		
 	
 		okay well i i
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i guess if i was having a dinner party i depending on the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> i might cook a like a brisket or a roast or a maybe a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chicken dish</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and um i guess i usually plan
 		probably a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lettuce salad</ENAMEX> and a
 		a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">potato dish</ENAMEX> and we usually serve fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX> and uh then make a dessert
 	
 	
 		oh that sounds good
 	
 	
 		so that makes
 	
 	
 		um we're not uh real <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wealthy</ENAMEX> at the moment last time i had <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> over for dinner we had lasagna
 		and i used my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>'s recipe i really like it it's got um you cook the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">noodles</ENAMEX> and
 		make and brown hamburger and put tomato <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sauce</ENAMEX> in with it and
 		i'm not sure she even puts
 		must be some <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spices</ENAMEX> in there i can't remember but um for the cheese part you mix uh sour <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cream</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cream cheese</ENAMEX> and cottage cheese
 	
 	
 		well that sounds good
 	
 	
 		and uh layer all that and it's good and then then uh uh tossed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salad</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		that sounds good
 	
 	
 		and um  oh my goodness <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diane</ENAMEX> get down from there  and uh
 		let's see what else did i  serve with that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">corn</ENAMEX> yeah i made <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bread</ENAMEX> with that one too i have a recipe that's  pretty good for that
 	
 	
 		bread do you have <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bread</ENAMEX> to go with it
 		gosh
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		oh well lasagna's always wonderful for large crowds
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i've heard you know i've heard a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> say
 		uh it short cut on the cooking for lasagna they they've told me that they go to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam</ENAMEX>'s and buy a great big pan of lasagna
 	
 	
 		i've heard that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam</ENAMEX>'s has a really good lasagna
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		in in fact i think i had it at a  at a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> once it was good yeah
 	
 	
 		did you well i i know <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that have have served it and they say gosh if you have <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> coming
 	
 	
 		easy
 	
 	
 		where you don't want to be always in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen</ENAMEX> it's easy and she said it's they said it's good so that that's always sounds good to me um i feel like i feel like i'm in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen</ENAMEX> cooking a lot
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i cook  guess i cook a seems seems like i cook a lot of dinners so uh not always for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> just for just for family
 	
 	
 		oh i know
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		so feels like i'm often in the kitchen
 	
 	
 		not my favorite place but
 	
 	
 		but a time consuming place to be
 	
 	
 		a necessity
 	
 	
 		yeah right right so
 		what
 	
 	
 		let's see what else do we like to have for
 		trying to think what else i like to serve
 		my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> likes to serve taco grandes
 	
 	
 		no i don't know what that is no i don't know what that is
 	
 	
 		have you ever had that
 		you take a flour tortilla and you fry it like a taco shell and you uh for all the inside parts you brown hamburger and put some um
 	
 	
 		okay right
 	
 	
 		tomato <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sauce</ENAMEX> in it and and i like to just add <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Picante</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sauce</ENAMEX> to get the  <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> flavor so you don't have to mess with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spices</ENAMEX> and stuff  and then um
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		let's see and then and you heat up <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">refried beans</ENAMEX> and you cut up <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tomatoes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lettuce</ENAMEX> and grated cheese
 		and what you do to make it you take the shell and you spread the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beans</ENAMEX> on first then you put the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meat</ENAMEX> then you put the grated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cheese</ENAMEX> and then you put um
 		see what's next  then and i i usually put the cut up <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tomatoes</ENAMEX> next
 		and then the um
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lettuce</ENAMEX> and you can put uh like guacamole
 		and  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Katy</ENAMEX> i'm on the phone well get a towel or go change i'm on the phone
 		um
 		oh a little sour <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cream</ENAMEX> is good and and chopped olives
 	
 	
 		right
 		right do you like to make your own guacamole
 	
 	
 		uh yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		we've
 		we don't make it very often i guess but uh
 	
 	
 		no no i don't very often usually when we get avocados my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> just like to eat them plain so it yeah i just cut slices off and i like an avocado sandwich too
 	
 	
 		oh do they gosh
 		oh gosh
 		oh that's good that's good or it's always good on top of something in the sandwich
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		oh well we made i made guacamole that i would take to a pool <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> across the street <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the other day</TIMEX> and and everyone there
 		said they never made <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">guacamole salad</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		what you want  uh where do they get it
 	
 	
 		so
 		well i don't know i guess they don't have it at home
 	
 	
 		i can't imagine it would stay fresh long enough to i guess they just buy it at a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX> when they eat it at a restaurant maybe
 	
 	
 		they must they just said they never had it at home so i i was concerned that i oh taking this you know taking this
 		as a dip i thought gosh you know sometimes when we have it at home it it turns dark on the top so quickly so i just
 	
 	
 		yeah it helps if you it helps if you leave the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pit</ENAMEX> in it
 	
 	
 		oh does that help
 	
 	
 		yeah if you leave the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pit</ENAMEX> in the bowl with the thing especially while you're waiting before you serve it
 	
 	
 		okay well
 	
 	
 		that's supposed to help keep the
 		um keep it from turning brown so quick
 	
 	
 		well i'll have to remember that well i just i <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that day</TIMEX> i just took extra lemon and just squeezed across the top and it really stayed longer than i ever thought it would so i thought maybe that was the trick
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh that's good
 		that probably helps too
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah so oh well i guess we bought  a lot of we've been buying <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">turkey</ENAMEX> lately instead of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beef</ENAMEX> so even though you know the ground turkey it's
 	
 	
 		do you want it
 		oh yeah we have too
 	
 	
 		the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meat</ENAMEX> is softer and i everybody seems to like it  so
 	
 	
 		do you want scrambled
 		
 
 	
 	
 		we've
 		most sometimes it seems to be cheaper too so we often buy the we buy the
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah if you get it on sale
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah so we bought that or we bought the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fillets</TIMEX> and then the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chicken</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">turkey nuggets</ENAMEX> and i don't think anybody in my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> knows the difference unless you tell them so or in
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i don't think mine know either in fact we've been getting lunch <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meat</ENAMEX> that's <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">turkey</ENAMEX> too it costs less than the other and
 		i don't know there's supposed to be something more healthy about it  <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">poultry</ENAMEX> instead of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beef</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		less <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> less <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> yeah right right well i guess that's probably all we need to do for today
 	
 	
 		pork yeah
 		yeah i i can't think of any other specific things i like to serve
 		um
 	
 	
 		i always like dessert
 	
 	
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sa lad</ENAMEX> that we always like
 		my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister-in-law</ENAMEX> always brings to family dinners is a
 		i don't know what you call it
 		uh you mix
 		um
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cottage cheese</ENAMEX> and a package of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JELL-O</ENAMEX> and a thing of uh like CoolWhip
 	
 	
 		right right that's always good probably probably the only family recipe that we
 	
 	
 		that's good and quick and easy
 	
 	
 		we make and it's really for special occasions is <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cheese cake</ENAMEX> and we take a  recipe from my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandmother</ENAMEX> and um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it's probably fairly typical  <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cream cheese</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egg</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sugar</ENAMEX> in the insides but the
