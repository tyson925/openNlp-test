 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay
 		um do you have a large <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> or do you live in an <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> or or like
 	
 	
 		well we live in uh it's a single family <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> and i guess it um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it's kind of well sort of big for the area um and it's got uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedrooms</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two and a half baths</TIMEX>
 		and uh its on a color sack
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		how about yours
 	
 	
 		uh well we have a pretty large <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> and uh it's larger than the average house you know in the area
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but um we need a large home cause there's twelve <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> in my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> so uh we have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedrooms</ENAMEX> uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two kitchens two</NUMEX> full kitchens uh we have
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a half</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">baths</ENAMEX> also
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know uh plus we have a full <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">basement</ENAMEX> that's in a into a game <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> that's wall to wall carpeting
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		you know um
 		we have uh it would be like a
 		i do not know i guess it would be like a family <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> other than from the playroom the playroom is where we watch all our TV and stuff but we have another <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> you know kind of like for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> and stuff
 	
 	
 		huh
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh
 		let me think that's about all but it's all split level
 	
 	
 		split level house
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		okay well ours is a ranch style and uh
 	
 	
 		oh i like <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ranch style</ENAMEX> houses
 	
 	
 		we we had a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">townhouse</ENAMEX> here uh we still have a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">townhouse</ENAMEX> which we are renting out so this is our <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> uh i guess single family home
 		and so we find that we have uh a lot to do uh to fix it up to the way we like it a lot of remodeling and all uh mostly cosmetic and we had a a deck put in in the back
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so it looks you know that's real nice to go out in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">now</TIMEX> and then a fence around the yard so that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> can stay in the yard
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and not run around the neighborhood
 	
 	
 		well how much uh land did you get with it
 	
 	
 		how much what
 	
 	
 		land
 	
 	
 		uh i think it was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a quarter acre uh-huh</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		is it
 		we have almost an acre yeah it's it's funny because we have um
 	
 	
 		really that's a pretty big area
 	
 	
 		a a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stall garage</ENAMEX> right beside our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> but you can fit <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> in it it's long enough you know you can fit <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> in
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and and some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that don't know us ask which <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> we live in  and it's like oh  just our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garage</ENAMEX>  then uh we have a front porch and a back porch on our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and our back porch we enclosed
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but that's kind of like another <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> on itself
 	
 	
 		uh okay well what we have our family <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> when ah you know we bought it we noticed that it was really dark
 		and uh one of the things that it has in it is uh real dark paneling wooden paneling
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		it also has brown carpet and just kind of uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> small windows so what we are thinking of doing is uh uh changing the carpet to a lighter color and then we have heard that with the paneling you can wallpaper over it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		or paint it and so that's what we are planning to do is to put a chair rail across the family <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> paint or wallpaper from the chair rail up and then uh
 		paint the chair rail on down in in like a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a light</NUMEX> blue color sort of i guess
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">uh Williamsburg</ENAMEX> blue we are calling it but whether there's there's a color like that or not since we are near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Williamsburg</ENAMEX> but uh we are hoping that will lighten up the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> a lot and make it give it you know give it a bigger appearance it has a fireplace in it too
 	
 	
 		yeah uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and if that doesn't work we uh our next door <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX> is a roofer and he said he would help me put in a skylight so
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		we'll try that last resort if uh if the painting does not help
 	
 	
 		yeah well all our walls are white you know well they are plaster except for our you know in the basement the playroom and we have um it's a real light brown you know kind of like a tan
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh the carpet is pretty light too so it's it's it is a pretty large you know playroom and  the lighter colors do help makes it look much bigger than what it really is
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		what kind of carpeting do you have
 	
 	
 		um it it has different colors in it but when you <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> look at it it just kind of looks like a brownish color you know it has like <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">browns</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">yellows</ENAMEX> in it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		is it uh is it a real short or a thick carpet real short
 	
 	
 		real short yeah
 	
 	
 		okay because we were looking at something that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are we have seen advertised called i guess it's berber or something or berbar or something and uh and we understand that that's supposed to be good for like a family <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> cause it's you know it wears really well and all that
 	
 	
 		yeah see well because we have so many with a real thick carpet with so many of us it gets worn down too fast so uh most of the carpet in our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> is the short carpet
 	
 	
 		right right
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 	
 	
 		in fact well we just got our uh like where we where we have <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> and stuff we just got that recarpeted and we think it's uh
 		bigger carpet you know the longer thicker stuff but uh  as the little ones were starting to move out and stuff so you know there's not as many of us here now
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 		right
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		the other thing we are learning a lot about is uh we have a craw space under the house
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and we are learning a lot about  moisture free and uh
 		everything like that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so uh as far as uh keeping the vents open and closed you know this is all new to us not having a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> that had this before and
 		and uh keeping the vents open you know during when it's warm and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> and all that and i guess <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">spring summer fall</TIMEX> and i guess in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the winter</TIMEX> you close the vents and
 		and making sure that the rain the rain gutters from you know the roof and all
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		empty out i  instead of right near the house
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and things like that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well we have a wood burner in our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and you know it heats a lot of it because it is a larger <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX>  would be too much to heat with just electric but uh we have  yeah
 	
 	
 		so we were
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wood</ENAMEX> a wood burning stove is it in the middle of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> or against the wall
 	
 	
 		it's against the wall
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh it's down in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">basement</ENAMEX> and it's kind of like in and enclosed little room by itself
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> enclosed it off so you kind of go into another <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> to it
 		uh but we had to learn to keep like all all the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedrooms</ENAMEX> are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floors</ENAMEX> above it and we had to learn to keep all the
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> were shut on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> floor for the hot air to get up to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedrooms</ENAMEX> for like in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the winter</TIMEX> and stuff
 	
 	
 		uh okay
 		right
 	
 	
 		ye ah
 	
 	
 		wow that's pretty neat
 	
 	
 		but uh i guess do you have much mowing to do with yours then
 	
 	
 		much mowing yeah well actually it's a lot bigger than we thought it was  when we first saw it when we actually have to mow it it seems to get bigger but uh the mow the way ours is is it's kind of a pie shaped
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh you know boundaries or whatever and we are sitting against the pointy end of the pie the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> sits back and it so our front yard is actually the bigger <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">yard</ENAMEX> and um
 	
 	
 		oh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and when we <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> got here you know there's it it i guess a long time ago it uh you know we were talking to our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> and they said the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">yard</ENAMEX> was one of the better or the best yard in the neighborhood because  really kept it up and over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</TIMEX> uh
 		just <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> were just renting it out and all that they a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">weeds</ENAMEX> and all that have grown up
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and so we have decided to get somebody for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one year</TIMEX> of service to help control the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">weeds</ENAMEX> and get it green again and then i will take over from there and so but i have to mow it at least once a week or else it looks bad
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah well uh it well we have just an acre we uh
 	
 	
 		so
 		use a rider
 	
 	
 		yeah  yeah definitely and uh well my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mom</ENAMEX> hates dandelions so we had stuff on our yard you know but it's uh it's pretty green she likes a nice green yard
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
