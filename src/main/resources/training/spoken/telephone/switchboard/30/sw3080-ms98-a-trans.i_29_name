 
     		
 	
 		all right do you do exercise
 	
 	
 		i do yes i uh uh i guess it actually changes i do a number of different things simply walking with my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> and sometimes my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> will come along on her little bicycle
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		right
 		
 
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> and then moving up i run in the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">mornings</TIMEX> not every <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> it probably averages <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about two days</TIMEX> a week
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		right
 	
 	
 		and then with my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> i actually go to the gym and lift weights which isn't i understand quite exercising but it's along the lines
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		how about yourself
 	
 	
 		well um that's a hard question to answer because i do physical things but i don't always set out for them to be exercise
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i walk with my parents
 		occasionally nothing's real regular about this because i have a weird schedule and they have a normal schedule and um
 		i play racquetball but i haven't since i've been out of school i don't have anywhere to do that but that's going to start soon again and um i play softball once a week which is kind of more recreation than exercise
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		because i really don't like to exercise i think that's the basic point of it is i'm not i i don't enjoy it if i know that it's exercise but if it's like a social activity or a recreational activity i don't mind
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 	
 	
 		so i have to disguise it it's like feeding little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">babies</ENAMEX> food and telling them it's something else so that they'll eat it that's kind of the same thing for me i have to not know that it's exercise so i can do it
 	
 	
 		that's right
 		right so you look at it more as a task
 	
 	
 		well yeah if it's exercise it's a task i don't want to do anything i have to do
 	
 	
 		right
 		i see
 	
 	
 		i mean i'll voluntarily clean the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bathroom</ENAMEX> but i won't do it if i have to do it
 	
 	
 		right right so i'm <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty two years old</TIMEX> which is probably different than yourself
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		right i'm <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty two</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		and so it's interesting that as you get older you begin to understand that you need to exercise my job at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texas Instruments</ENAMEX> i have to sit in front of a computer <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all day</TIMEX> and make phone calls so
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		that i don't get any exercise doing that and plus there's a build up of stress so i need to go out and take those walks after dinner and i need to go out in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX> and run or i'll just get nuts
 	
 	
 		right
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		right
 	
 	
 		so that's kind of a motivator so even though i can look at it as a task
 		the you know i kind of get the i get some kind of global benefit from the whole thing by saying well i'm lowering my chance of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart attack</ENAMEX> and thus that type stuff
 	
 	
 		right
 		huh
 		eating right and no <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> and all that
 	
 	
 		sure that all i i do all that
 	
 	
 		yeah we i'm sure i will do i'm doing that more and more than i used to i think i'm getting
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i'm getting better about this knowing that i need exercise and doing it but it's still at the task stage
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		is it a pleasure for you or are you
 	
 	
 		well it's a something as simple as a walk with my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> is very enjoyable i do that at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the day</TIMEX> and it takes you know that that during that time the stress from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> goes away i get to share whatever i did with my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> and and vice versa
 	
 	
 		hum
 		right
 		right
 	
 	
 		going to the gym is is actually something different than than like oh and the running and i enjoy that too year i've been running since high school on track <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> and the like so
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so running i i'm at that point which you probably get to after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about six months</TIMEX> of dedicated running where you don't feel your muscles any more
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		right
 	
 	
 		and you don't think about the pain of it you you you take the time to relax some how and you think about other things during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">those first few months</TIMEX> you have to think about running and why your elbow hurts and why you can't breathe and this and that and that's no fun and it's so hard to get past that for a lot of people
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		right that's i never got past that stage
 	
 	
 		yeah the exercise the uh weight lifting on the other hand is actually you know i think i look better
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i have just a i don't i'm not a huge <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> i'm just a regular looking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> but just going to lift weights on occasion with my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> thinks the same thing about both me and herself that get that little bit of definition in your muscles is is attractive
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		right
 	
 	
 		so that pays also
 	
 	
 		that's good
 	
 	
 		yeah so so i guess that aspect of that takes away the work the with my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> which is nice i love her you know i enjoy being with her i guess that's one thing but also uh that that long term benefit of a little bit of tone in your muscles
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		right that's it i do the occasional push up and sit up i haven't really brought myself to go to the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the gym</TIMEX> because that's very stressful to me because i feel
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i felt real competitive there and i need to find some place i could go and not feel like there's all these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who are just huge and hulking that are
 	
 	
 		but
 		oh yeah i don't i don't let that bother me but yeah that's something that comes with time too you know i'll tell you the sit ups and push ups are excellent
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know it's your own you you're you're struggling against your own body weight
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		you can do have variety by putting your feet higher or lower by putting your arms further apart or closer together by doing them real quick or real slow and you can actually get a good work you can
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i know in the push up at least you can get chest muscles and the back of your arms quite built up just doing push ups
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		that's a good idea but i do have my ride we have a stationary bicycle and a stair step machine here at the house
 	
 	
 		oh is that right
 	
 	
 		i'll do those once in a while just you know like at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eleven</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Love Connection</ENAMEX> is on and i can't sleep i'll get up and stair step for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">half an hour so</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah
 		right
 		
 
 		that's funny
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's i guess pretty pretty healthy but i don't have an a regular plan that's
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i need to get started on that
 	
 	
 		well maybe you know maybe not i'd say i'd say at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty two</TIMEX> you don't necessarily need a plan as long as you're getting getting the exercise otherwise
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		when your life becomes sedentary is when you have to make yourself a plan and what's real funny about plans is that there's a struggle between
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh when you when you add something to your life when you add a plan to your life something else has to go away
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and that's the hard decision is okay if i'm going to run in the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">mornings</TIMEX> what am i what do i trade it off for well the answer's sleep right if i'm going to walk at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> what do i trade it off for well <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Star Trek</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		sleep
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		or you know it it it's always trade-offs and you actually have to as you get older you have to re <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ally</ENAMEX> think what can go and what to to to replace this thing it's i mean not just exercise but anything it's
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right
 	
 	
 		very hard and uh i don't i don't think you should worry about not having a program yet
 	
 	
 		that'll come <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">some day</TIMEX> when i
 	
 	
 		yep
 		
 
 		yeah i guess if you care or if your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> your future <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> uh gives you a reason to care which helps
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		well i think we covered it
 	
 	
 		well i hope so yeah sounds good
 	
 	
 		nice talking with you <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Craig</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah you too have a nice day bye
 	
 	
 		you too good day bye
