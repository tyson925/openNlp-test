 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay well good <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> and uh i guess the topic here is going to be hobbies hobbies and if you have any just tell me what they are
 	
 	
 		right
 		well right now the main thing that i've been doing craft wise anyway is uh i make earrings out of paper and buttons and i do sweatshirts and um
 	
 	
 		
 
 		really
 	
 	
 		yes how about you
 	
 	
 		oh that sounds fascinating um well i'm i'm pretty traditional i've i've been doing um a little bit of quilting and uh made my first quilt ever i mean it's wonderful it's beautiful
 		i don't know if there'll be a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> one but the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> one is you know hand pieced and hand sewn and it took <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> upon <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> to do this anyway um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		there's that and then uh now i i've developed an interest in watercolor so i'm taking some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX> over at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michael</ENAMEX>'s
 		and i'm trying to uh make it look good
 	
 	
 		that sounds really interesting my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> does uh painting he's been doing in acrylics and he wanted to do some things in watercolor i hear that's one of the hardest mediums to work in however
 	
 	
 		i don't know that i just someone gave me some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">paints</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas one year</TIMEX> and i said okay i'll try this
 	
 	
 		are you pretty artistic
 	
 	
 		i guess i am i'm i've i've been sort of painting stuff and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> say why don't you let me hang that in my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> you know
 		so i've got stuff hanging in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> that i look at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">now</TIMEX> and i go oh i can do so much better than that so i guess i've you know
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		developed somewhere along the line but um you know it's it's an interesting thing and i really do like it it's real peaceful it's real quiet you know
 	
 	
 		well to me the quilting sounds like the thing that would be
 		the hardest to stick with because it is so time consuming
 	
 	
 		it is it's amazing the results are incredible
 	
 	
 		have you thought about selling them
 	
 	
 		um no because i can't get beyond making this <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> quilt i'm afraid  if i make another one i'm keeping it  the watercolor i can dash off in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty minutes</TIMEX> and that's you know it's finished but um yeah the quilting forget it
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		um i would even join a quilting group maybe to help somebody else finish their quilt sort of thing
 	
 	
 		well you know what i've kind of been looking for i sew not as much as i used to but uh i have scraps of fabric
 		and i thought it'd be nice if i could find you know maybe uh in senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> home or something to give the pieces to maybe these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> could use a little bits of uh you know leftover fabric
 	
 	
 		you're right yeah they love that that would be good really and uh
 	
 	
 		all you have to do is figure out how to get hold of some of these people
 	
 	
 		yeah i yeah i'm finding out that um there there are an awful lot of quilters out there and and it's not just traditional quilting either <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> you know are using it for making clothes
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		they have of they make they call them crazy quilts
 	
 	
 		like the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vests</ENAMEX> or something
 	
 	
 		the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vests</ENAMEX> and things like that and they make whole outfits out of you know scraps of this and that and it's getting to be a real art form
 		what you wear on your back  you know  maybe you'd like to try it  um but i think it's great that we have the availability here to you know um like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael</ENAMEX>'s
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and and be able to be trained and and do some things like that so that's a lot of fun i
 	
 	
 		well i was looking into uh i wanted to take a flower arranging class class and i called i think i called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael</ENAMEX>'s and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zak</ENAMEX>'s both and as it turned out <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the month</TIMEX> that i called they didn't have anything and then i didn't call back
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		but i think it'd be nice to learn how to arrange silk <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> and uh save yourself some money on some of the flower arrangements
 	
 	
 		oh sure
 		oh absolutely and i just i love <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> i you know i got to have <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> around me you know kind of thing um but the button thing now that sounds really interesting you make earrings
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		some of them i'll just uh well <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX> when i was sewing quite a bit i found a place that you could buy bags of buttons
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know assorted buttons and oh sometimes you got <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> of a kind sometimes you got <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of a kind but anyway i decided when i started making paper earrings maybe i'd branch out a little bit
 		and i got out my button collection and there were a lot of things in there that i could make particularly the metal ones you know i could just put backs on them
 	
 	
 		oh right
 	
 	
 		um i'd have to clip off the uh shanks and all but then some of them after i ran out of that i just started painting them with my uh sweatshirt paints
 		and you know making things to match my outfits
 	
 	
 		oh how clever
 	
 	
 		so i've been having a good time with that
 	
 	
 		right my my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister-in-law</ENAMEX> up uh in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Illinois</ENAMEX> she was well
 		in a real rural <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">area</ENAMEX> and she's starting to collect antique buttons and she makes big huge pins out of them
 		and these big wooden buttons are just  um you know they're all sort of layered and put together and glued and back and everything but they are just incredible they're so pretty
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		well a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> of mine said uh had a pin that was made out of antique buttons and the thing was just gorgeous
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and it's they're all wooden buttons it's really neat and she says everybody up there wears buttons on their socks
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yeah they just you know um do some artistic thing with the buttons and i don't know if they hot glue them on or whatever but
 	
 	
 		i guess that hasn't hit in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> yet i haven't seen any of that
 	
 	
 		yeah i know well this is this is mid state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Illinois</ENAMEX> i don't know how long it will take if it ever gets here you know but that's what they're doing with buttons down or up there but it's really neat i i uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and and you do the painting on the T-shirts too the sweatshirts
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		well that's what we did for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> as a matter of fact for all our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> and family we gave them the hand painted sweatshirts and thank goodness my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> helped me with it because i think i had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about fourteen</NUMEX> to do
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh there you are
 	
 	
 		and uh i thought i'll i'll either be working on this constantly or i'm never going to have these finished by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> but they really did turn out pretty i was really pleased with them
 	
 	
 		what kind of medium do you use on them or do you like glitter and painting scenes and
 	
 	
 		uh i usually use a transfer we've done some southwest things and uh i've done some <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> but i haven't gotten so far as to do oh you know some of the little pin on
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bows</ENAMEX> and everything it's strictly been painting so far but i'll use um i did use some glitter paint on a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas one</TIMEX> and some in some of the metallic paints
 	
 	
 		oh well still
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and you know each time i do one i try something a little bit different
 	
 	
 		um
 		oh well see that's that's really neat that's a great outlet
 	
 	
 		the only problem is i've done so many i don't know when i want to touch another sweatshirt again
