 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		um i i personally have a lot of feelings about the way our judicial system is run but um yeah
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		i do not know i just uh  i i do not know i have you ever been for called for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jury</ENAMEX> duty
 	
 	
 		no i haven't have you
 	
 	
 		no i haven't  and oh is that you
 	
 	
 		i am still here
 	
 	
 		oh okay uh  a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> of mine was just called before and uh it's amazing the that they have to go through <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about four hundred</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to get a a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jury</ENAMEX> for this  one case
 	
 	
 		good grief
 	
 	
 		because um there was everybody seemed to have some sort of bias
 		you know uh very hard to find um you know extremely um um yeah impartial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> but anyway i think it would be interesting but um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		impartial
 	
 	
 		how do you what do you think about the way it's run
 	
 	
 		well
 		well the you know on the suggested topic was to talk about whether uh verdicts had to be unanimous decisions
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right
 	
 	
 		and i thought that was
 		that really got me to thinking you know and i think we really need them to be unanimous
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		because
 		i'd hate to think that that you know if if i was charged with something that i was not guilty of that i got convicted on a you know <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> verdict
 	
 	
 		yeah  that's true that's a good point um aren't they supposed to be unanimous though now isn't that the way it is okay
 	
 	
 		you know
 		yeah they are i think they need to stay that way
 	
 	
 		yes i agree i do although i do not know i think the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> should be involved i really at this point i am not sure how it works but let's say that a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jury</ENAMEX> decides somebody is guilty
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> disagrees
 		it it's not the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judges</ENAMEX> final decision right it's the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jury</ENAMEX>'s
 	
 	
 		right it's absolutely up to the jury
 	
 	
 		see and and my feeling is this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> knows a whole i do not know i mean that's his job you know that and it seems like all he is is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediator mediator</ENAMEX> of the whole thing
 	
 	
 		i know it
 		but then if if you give him too much power
 		you know that who knows i mean we got crooked cops
 	
 	
 		well that's true yep you're right there's crooked everybody
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i know it
 	
 	
 		it's really scary because you know you see i do not know if you ever watch saw the movie <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Presumed Innocent</ENAMEX> did you see that oh my God it's fabulous if you ever can rent it or something
 	
 	
 		so
 		no i didn't
 		is it
 		i've been trying to and it's never there yes
 	
 	
 		really it's just great and it it's scary because it's just about that there are crooked cops and the whole case points to this one <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> and you know he is innocent and um
 	
 	
 		that that kind of stuff ought to scar us to death i mean
 	
 	
 		yeah it does
 		and then you watch this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> go to jail for um i should not be telling you because you are going to want to see it
 	
 	
 		well i knot that he goes it it for the murder right
 	
 	
 		yeah and he goes to jail um
 	
 	
 		i just
 	
 	
 		and oh it's really scary
 	
 	
 		that would be awful
 	
 	
 		yeah but but then i also see um oh i do not know this one case here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rochester</ENAMEX> where um we had a serial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">killer</ENAMEX> and they finally caught him and
 		it  here he the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> had basically admitted to killing twelve girls yeah unbelievable and um
 	
 	
 		good grief
 	
 	
 		yet it was it was almost a type of thing where he almost wasn't guilty because they had this little flaw <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> piece of evidence
 	
 	
 		that's
 		that's what bothers me the technicalities and that's where i think the judge maybe ought to have more say you know
 	
 	
 		uh  ah
 		yeah
 		right
 		i agree
 	
 	
 		because i can't believe that
 		that we can let the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> off that we are letting off because you did not tell them this one statement before you took them to jail you know  like
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		right oh right or the whole the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marion Berry</ENAMEX> thing you know the the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX> uh how they determined that he was um oh i do not know it was set up or something
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		it's just
 	
 	
 		i mean  this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> is dealing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> it's not set up he was just doing it yeah you know
 	
 	
 		i'm sorry
 		he was doing it entrapment i'm sorry you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh i would love to be on a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jury</ENAMEX> because i i do think it's fascinating i i i think it it's it's hard system i mean you are never going to get a right and a wrong you know it's just
 	
 	
 		there's no <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX> it's shades of gray
 	
 	
 		that that's right
 		yep
 	
 	
 		and i think i am like you i think it would be really fascinating i do not think i would want to be on a highly publicized case though i do not think i would like that  at all
 	
 	
 		me either because it is tense for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">jurors</ENAMEX> that were on this serial killing uh they couldn't read the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX> they couldn't watch TV they couldn't talk about it and this went on for like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six months</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		i'm sure
 		well you know they had uh a big <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> trial in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Roanoke Virginia</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of years ago</TIMEX> and my my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> was called for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jury</ENAMEX> duty on that and he said that they had <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guards</ENAMEX> armed
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		huh really
 	
 	
 		you know <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guards</ENAMEX> posted everywhere and he was really glad that he wasn't called because he said that this would have been too much
 	
 	
 		wow
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so i wouldn't like that at all
 	
 	
 		oh my goodness
 		i like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wapner</ENAMEX> type of thing
 	
 	
 		yeah a real simple uncomplicated thing you know
 	
 	
 		
  
 		right like uh my <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> bit the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX> or something
 	
 	
 		we could start out small and work our way up
 	
 	
 		yeah exactly
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		but it's just it's scary because um there there's just so much that can go wrong that could let an innocent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> be convicted or a guilty <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> have them let go
 	
 	
 		absolutely that the nuances
 	
 	
 		and
 		yeah and um
 		i do not know i guess it's it i do not know a lot about the terms but a hung <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jury</ENAMEX> is that when the it's not completely unanimous
 	
 	
 		that
 		yeah you know it would be split one way or another and and that ends in a mistrial
 	
 	
 		oh so what happens nothing
 	
 	
 		so they have to retry them they have to bring in a whole new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jury</ENAMEX> they have to absolutely start over again
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh my God
 	
 	
 		so and i do not know how many times you can
 		have a hung <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jury</ENAMEX> i do not know if they the i don't guess they have to go back to
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 	
 	
 		trial i guess you know they could drop the charges if they didn't think they'd ever convict him
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		did you see <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Sixty Minutes</ENAMEX> by any chance on um
 		i guess it was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this past Sunday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> they showed a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> who um he's a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> and what he's like known for now is getting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> um
 	
 	
 		no i didn't
 		uh-hum
 	
 	
 		off of charges of killing their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wives</ENAMEX> or their ex-wives yeah isn't that lovely so there's this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> um i forget what his name is and he is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> someplace and he's gotten so far <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about four or five</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh that's nice
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> um free of the charge one <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> went in stabbed his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ex-wife</ENAMEX> to death because she was sleeping with another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> i mean <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ex-wife</ENAMEX> you know we're talking and
 	
 	
 		oh my gosh yeah well
 	
 	
 		and um
 		he got them off on the basis that he went temporarily insane
 	
 	
 		yeah i'll bet he did
 	
 	
 		right temporally insane that she provoked this in him because he was so madly in love with her that seeing you know this other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> with her just drove him crazy
 	
 	
 		oh
 		and it was her fault that he killed her
 	
 	
 		yeah exactly it was her fault her uh they interviewed her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> it was crazy so now he has to serve like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six months</TIMEX> in a rehab <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		sure
 		and get psychiatric treatment
 	
 	
 		exactly
