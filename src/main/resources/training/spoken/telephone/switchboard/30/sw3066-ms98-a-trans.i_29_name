 		oh so get got <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> with a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">puppies</ENAMEX> still in it
 	
 	
 		um-hum i am afraid so
 	
 	
 		do you train them did you train them
 	
 	
 		uh-huh somewhat
 	
 	
 		do can they do tricks and stuff
 	
 	
 		well a little bit i am mainly i just like them for companionship and you know they they they can retrieve and that sort of thing but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		i don't teach them to do dancing or anything
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		how about yourself
 	
 	
 		well my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> thinks he's married to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ellie May Clampitt</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		is that right
 	
 	
 		yes we have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> and lots of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> and then uh where i live i have some wild rabbits that live outside so
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i consider them my <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pets</ENAMEX> too
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i go out and talk to them and give them you know things out of the refrigerator i do not know if they ever really eat any of it or not but uh my <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> are mainly just mutts they are they are all big though they are like <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lab</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> Collie
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		so i have big <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> and i had never had big dogs until i got married i had a little toy <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poodle</ENAMEX> as i was growing up
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> had <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bird dogs</ENAMEX> but you know i normally i was used to having a little <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">puppy</ENAMEX> that i could hold and snuggle and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> these big <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> are something else
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		but you know what it surprises me my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX> has um <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dalmatians</ENAMEX> and they want to be in your lap just like <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">puppies</ENAMEX> do
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		yeah that's what one of my my male dog thinks he is a lap dog but uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it's real funny because we have a water bed and one of my <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> is afraid of the thunder and so when it thunders she hits the water <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bed and</ENAMEX> like catapults you up
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it's a real treat
 	
 	
 		yes i'm sure it is you just never know where you are going to be do you  oh
 	
 	
 		no but it's real funny cause she's just big and she's real ferocious but boy if it thunders she is just like a little baby
 	
 	
 		hum
 		that really tames her down quick doesn't it
 	
 	
 		oh yeah it's real funny i got a book on you know how to train you dog to keep from being afraid of thunder but golly i had to quit my job and stay home
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 		that's interesting i i had a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a</NUMEX> miniature <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">Schnauzer um</ENAMEX> i've always had them well since the early seventies i really like the breed
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um but my silver one i had to put to sleep <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few years ago</TIMEX> but now she she was afraid of thunder but she would go into the main bathroom which is surrounded by the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> there's no outside windows or anything okay
 	
 	
 		oh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i guess she felt safest there but she'd crawl into the bath tub
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		um-hum whenever there was thunder and lightning and then i felt just bad for her because she would shake even thought she was in there but there was not much i could do
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		huh
 	
 	
 		but the other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">the the puppy i</ENAMEX> got after that which is the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the four year old</TIMEX> and then um i bought a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mate</ENAMEX> for her to have <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> and uh the young one that's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> old
 		they do not even notice it when it thunders and lightning huh-uh it does not bother them a bit
 	
 	
 		really
 		that's good
 		do they play get along real well with each other
 	
 	
 		um-hum very well together yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah well that's what my uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dr Jim Humphrey</ENAMEX>'s i watch his show sometimes and he said that <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> are pack <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> and so they are a lot happier when they have a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buddy</ENAMEX> to play with
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah and i always felt so guilty leaving the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> by itself you know and of course with your four
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		oh yeah they have they have a big time
 	
 	
 		yeah  oh that's great
 	
 	
 		but it's really funny cause i mean you know obviously nobody plans to have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> but uh my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> had the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> and then
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		shortly after we got married the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> behind us had a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> that they just were tired of and they were going to have her put to sleep and she was just gorgeous and we said no we will take her and find her a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> and we did
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		you kept her
 	
 	
 		
 
 		and then the little one that or the the last <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> i guess i should say um my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> saw her get hit by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> so he loaded her up and brought her home thinking we'd find her a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> and we did
 	
 	
 		oh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		because right now i am so attached to all of them i could not get rid of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> if i had to
 	
 	
 		i know well they sound like they are real fortunate to have found you too you know
 	
 	
 		oh yeah yeah they are real fun we take them pretty much everywhere i mean we have to God it costs us a fortune to board them
 	
 	
 		oh well sure it would
 	
 	
 		but um we go camping and they go with us and we have the best time
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		well how do you maintain any decorum around your house
 	
 	
 		
 
 		it's difficult
 		um they are all black and so i told my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> i said <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> next time we are either going to get a black carpet or blonde dogs
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		because i said
 		this is just too much and then <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> say when are you going to have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and we are like well when we start getting rid of dogs
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		my i have a neighbor we live on most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lots</ENAMEX> out here are <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a half acre</NUMEX> to an acre
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		and they have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> and what she's done is she sees them along side the road stray or something she will bring them home
 	
 	
 		oh my gosh
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> finally said that's enough you know we can't have any more
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but it's amazing i have gone over there and the majority is they were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two two</NUMEX> large <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> and they're outdoors and the other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> were in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> but you would never know that she had dogs
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		really
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		she must scrub the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floors</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		well my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> vacuums a lot  especially when they are shedding
 	
 	
 		um you almost have to
 		that's why i had the miniature <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schnauzers</ENAMEX> cause they do not shed yeah
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		well now my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> just got a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Schnauzer</ENAMEX> but i do not know i guess it's not considered miniature because um it's what i consider normal size
 	
 	
 		they have the standard and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">giant</ENAMEX>  and uh i understand i've been to dog shows and i have seen them i have not been around them but i understand that they are very gentle animals
 	
 	
 		oh
 		huh
 	
 	
 		even even so they are so big
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh the only thing that
 	
 	
 		well how big is big
 		i mean like the size of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Collie</ENAMEX> big
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um i believe the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the standard</TIMEX> are the size of a collie and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">giant</ENAMEX> gets bigger than that if i am not mistaken
 	
 	
 		wow
 		oh
 		well then what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daddy</ENAMEX> has must be a miniature too because it's
 	
 	
 		the miniatures are usually <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about fifteen inches</NUMEX> high yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		and that's how my are and then you know even though they are miniature they can be large for their size or small for their size
 	
 	
 		huh well have you ever seen a Schnoodle
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		i just love they were so cute
 	
 	
 		yes um a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> has one back home yeah they they are real cute
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		well the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time i saw <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> i just fell in love and me and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kyle</ENAMEX> just said like no we can't have any more <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX>  i know
 	
 	
 		
 
 		come on now get serious right that's enough is enough uh-huh
 	
 	
 		yeah it just kills me to go i can't even go into a pet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX> because i want a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">puppy</ENAMEX> so badly
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and so it's real funny all my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girlfriends</ENAMEX> say yeah everybody else is saying i want a baby and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackie</ENAMEX> is saying i want a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">puppy</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well i don't know if you if you have ever had a litter but it's a wonderful experience yeah um the older <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> that i've got she's had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> litters and it is so much fun
 	
 	
 		no
 		really
 		oh wow
 		oh but i just couldn't bear to give those <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">puppies</ENAMEX> away
 	
 	
 		
 
 		it oh listen i raised <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of them i kept <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> until they were <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about four months old</TIMEX> i just could not part with them and then you know i had to
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and i didn't think i would be able to sell them when they were <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three months old</TIMEX> but it was amazing i have a i have an enclosed <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">patio</ENAMEX> and so that's where i kept the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> and there's a doggie door they can go in and out into the backyard that's fenced so the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> trained the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">puppies</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh really well that's neat
 	
 	
 		yeah to to go in and out and it's real interesting to watch how they they take care of one another and how she corrects them and and when they they fight like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> and she will break them up it was just really neat
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		huh
 		
 
 		huh
 	
 	
 		and uh it was it was quite an experience and i wanted to the other one that i have is black and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">silver</ENAMEX> and i wanted to have <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">puppies</ENAMEX> with her but she had a medical problem and i had to have she had to have surgery so
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		she is not able to have puppies but she's and don't don't you
