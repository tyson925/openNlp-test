 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">huh-uh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i don't use it very much any more i used to use it quite a bit
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i also have a PC at work that i use as a terminal i do some PC stand alone work on it and i can transfer data back and forth between the PC and the main frame
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		what about you do you own a computer
 	
 	
 		um well i sort of own a computer we have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> PCs at home but neither one do we really own
 		um both are no both of them are sort of work related and
 	
 	
 		are you leasing them
 		loners loaners from work
 	
 	
 		yeah  that's the nicer way right of
 	
 	
 		do you work for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		no no um i actually i'm doing consulting right now because i just had a baby and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>'s working at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bell Labs</ENAMEX> but he's really from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> and these computers actually are from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		what <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">brand</ENAMEX> are they
 	
 	
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of them's a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Compaq</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it's a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">three eighty six</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		i'm jealous
 	
 	
 		and the other is actually a
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> PC compatible it's a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">three eighty six</NUMEX>
 		guess it's <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty five</TIMEX>
 		yeah <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three eight six twenty five</TIMEX> C maybe i don't know no we don't have the cash that's right we decided not to get the cash which is actually another loaner one too that we've picked up
 		for a consulting job that my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> was doing  and
 	
 	
 		what kind of consulting do you do
 	
 	
 		um well i actually do some work working at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIT</ENAMEX> and at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIST National Institute of Standards and Technology</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> and then i worked for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dragon Systems</ENAMEX>
 		for a while
 	
 	
 		what kind of work do you do when you're consulting
 	
 	
 		um well it depends it's very different in the different places
 		but
 	
 	
 		is it programming related
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah program related research related i've
 		i work in speech the speech field and i i do a lot about acoustics phonetics and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		looking at the uh acoustic characteristics of speech and so i do that type of stuff typically
 		for other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and we use uh here we use the PCs to do that and mostly i use it for writing papers and things like that
 	
 	
 		word processing
 	
 	
 		well more uh do you know Latek
 	
 	
 		no i'm not familiar with it
 	
 	
 		word text word text processing so i don't i don't use  i mean you can call it word processing but i don't usually use a word processor to do it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and we don't have too much standard software like i haven't bought
 		we haven't really bought any commercially available software at all so we don't use it for things like our accounts and addresses and things like that we use it more for just writing programs when we need to
 		or um
 		doing research looking at the speech signal and then doing writing
 		and also as a
 		just as a terminal and we connect to other computers to read our net mail and things like that
 	
 	
 		so you've got you've got a modem in it then
 	
 	
 		uh neither one has a modem but we have a modem
 	
 	
 		at home you have a modem that you can connect to each of them
 	
 	
 		neither one
 		right
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> and so it's an external modem i got when i got mine i had an internal modem in it i used it uh quite a bit when i was um
 	
 	
 		yeah we have
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh looking at uh information on a large bulletin board sponsored by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX> in a
 		in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fort Worth</ENAMEX> but uh went out of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> for a while and and sort of got off the uh uh bulletin board and of my micro completely
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and after a while the modem started making noises on its own without uh even without using it on the computer i could turn a computer on it'd start squawking so i finally opened up the box and took it out
 	
 	
 		
 
 		so that was it
 	
 	
 		i think that's the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty second</TIMEX> warning
 	
 	
 		oh i didn't hear it
 		do you hear the the beep in the background
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		oh that's a an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ambulance</ENAMEX> or something going on here i think
 	
 	
 		okay where
 	
 	
 		i haven't ever noticed the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty second</TIMEX> warning actually
 	
 	
 		where are you and uh
 	
 	
 		in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manhattan</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		are you at home now so you've got a lot of traffic noise real close
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm at home
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh</ENAMEX> so it'd be interesting for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that look at this signal i mean because there's a lot of background noise that you know <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> can hear so it'll be interesting how much of it actually gets picked up um
 		yeah and often times that i can't talk on the can't do this much later than now between sort of like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six five thirty and six thirty</TIMEX> or something like that because the traffic outside they honk the horn so loud i can't even hear the phone conversation
 	
 	
 		what time is it now where you are
 	
 	
 		uh <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about twenty</TIMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">four</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		so you're an hour ahead of where i am i'm in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Central Central</ENAMEX> time zone
 	
 	
 		okay yeah we're Eastern
 		and um
 		what did did you ever try using like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prodigy</ENAMEX> or any of those systems
 	
 	
 		no i haven't done that uh i know someone who has and and she's uh very uh pleased with it she told me some of the things you can do and it's just a a very uh handy tool to have
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah and and you can do a lot it it makes things very convenient you can save a lot of money too certainly cut down on long distance charges if you if that's what you have in mind
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah i've never tried using that i don't know too much about it what about have you did you use commercially available software or
 	
 	
 		i have uh i have used Lotus i have used uh <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Word Perfect</ENAMEX> uh i not heavy use i've used uh D <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Base</ENAMEX> and uh i've used a substantial amount of shareware
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um i haven't done much <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lotus</ENAMEX> work connected with my job i've been through <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> classes and i have a great deal of respect for it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um i haven't done much word processing work with my job i do some and i and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> Base work i've done was strictly class related
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		i've never used D Base  um but i've heard both good things and bad things about it
 	
 	
 		well it's probably the
 		granddaddy of most uh data base management systems there it's got some pretty uh strong <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">competitors</ENAMEX> some of them have reviews that are better than <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> Base so i uh i uh i think uh by now it's a matter of uh personal taste
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> told me that it was sort of cumbersome to use
 	
 	
 		i can understand that very easily i've used uh i've had a class on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">um R Base</ENAMEX> and also in Paradox and both of those seem very easy to use compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> Base
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		uh-huh do you think you D <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Base</ENAMEX> is more flexible or allows you to do more or do you think the others are pretty much compatible these days
 	
 	
 		um  i wouldn't say compatible but there certainly comparable
 	
 	
 		well i don't i yeah i didn't mean compatible i meant comparable my brain is going to mush
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		and what do you work on at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TI</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i'm a computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">programmer</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> main frames  i do uh main mainly business data processing
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>

 		um
 		sometimes i get called <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">late at night</TIMEX> at home because there's a production problem and that gives me the opportunity to
 		come in to work and fix it if i can't think of some thing to tell the trouble <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shooter</ENAMEX> while we're on the phone
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right
