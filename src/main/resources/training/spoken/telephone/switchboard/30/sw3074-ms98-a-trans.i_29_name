 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yes um  i i think that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plano</ENAMEX> has really done a fantastic job i mean at least their plans have are good um
 		how however i was maybe you saw in the paper <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this morning</TIMEX> that um they've had some problems with the recycling on plastic uh-huh i thought that was most interesting that
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		with the plastic
 		well i just i thought it was sad that they it  started out as a good program
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but then <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> started dumping trash and the wrong objects in there and i and that concerned me that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> were using it as a way to get rid of things they just didn't want to set at the curb or take to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dump</ENAMEX> and and uh
 	
 	
 		yes
 		yeah
 		that's right yeah
 		i guess that's going to happen
 	
 	
 		i it's too bad that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have to ruin a good part thing
 	
 	
 		yeah a really good effort that's right yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh
 	
 	
 		well i was thinking about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the other day</TIMEX> um when i when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dick</ENAMEX> and i were oh many <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many years ago</TIMEX> when we were first married and he was in graduate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Missouri</ENAMEX>
 		um i went oh i was probably this was probably see it  been like nineteen <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixty seven or sixty eight</TIMEX> um
 		we i went to a meeting and uh one of the the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">speakers</ENAMEX> at the meeting was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> who was recycling and um she was from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint Louis</ENAMEX> and she had this fantastic um family effort in in recycling
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		and she was dividing her colored <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glass</ENAMEX> and her <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plastics</ENAMEX> and her <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aluminum</ENAMEX> and i thought wow i mean how <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> is doing that you know but my my thought was
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		it's a shame i mean it's wonderful that she's doing it and it but wouldn't it be much much nicer if we all did it because her effort would have really um really uh been a good example for all of us
 		and yet you know and we were just sort of talking about it at the time and here we are you know now we're doing it on a city wide basis in in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> so it's wonderful that we've come that far i think but
 	
 	
 		doing it
 		what did she do with if if she was she like a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> that was doing it or was she doing it on her own and what did she do with the
 	
 	
 		um
 		i think she was i was trying to remember it seems to me that she was doing it on her own and living in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saint Louis</ENAMEX> there were places where she could actually take her uh things herself
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> and so it wasn't you know something that was being picked up or um and i think she was encouraging other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to do it if they would
 		but i remember her saying yes i have a trash can for this and a trash can for that and a trash can for the other thing and  i thought wow that's that is wonderful that somebody is doing that does that yeah
 	
 	
 		you you have to really want to do it though this is even even what you recycle because we we do the the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plastics</ENAMEX> and the and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aluminum</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glass</ENAMEX> and the paper
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		right
 		yes
 	
 	
 		and um and of course then you know you try to buy right too but um
 	
 	
 		sure you do uh-huh
 	
 	
 		a lot of our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> say well what you have to rinse out this and you have to make sure it's that and you have to it's uh we we had <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> that complained when we got the new garbage cans
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh</ENAMEX> isn't that amazing
 	
 	
 		and i thought what are you complaining about
 	
 	
 		well you know
 	
 	
 		when you're only going to get picked up once a month you know or once a week and
 	
 	
 		yes <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> i don't know they find fault in everything rather than say this is a good effort yeah i don't know it's it's i understand i know what you're saying kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> like that and
 	
 	
 		rather than work with it yeah
 		well it's for everybody's benefit i mean it's it's not so maybe we don't realize it in our lifetime but we you have to think <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandchildren</ENAMEX> and great <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandchildren</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		well sure it is
 		yep
 		yeah it's on down the line
 	
 	
 		what kind of quality of life are you leaving them and and the and i have a real concern about that uh
 	
 	
 		right
 		yes yeah i agree when
 	
 	
 		we've never had much trash because while while i was raised in a big <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> and and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gene</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> wasn't big but they weren't rich
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and they had to to recycle and and you know the food well they didn't they just used things they didn't throw things away before they were used up and
 	
 	
 		sure
 		yeah
 		right
 		yeah well i know um i guess i got a good example from my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> because she was always
 		very very conscientious about recycling things and she is to this day and you know i mean she'll even um if she
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		for instance she she would take the waxed paper out of a cereal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">box</ENAMEX> and use that for you know when she made <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cookies</ENAMEX> it would go on that or if she needed to wrap something for needed uh sandwich <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> or something she'd use that
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		right
 	
 	
 		she just she recycles everything and i have done the same thing i recycle like zip lock bags and things like that my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> get the biggest kick out of that although
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		they do the same thing  i mean they i think they give me a hard time but i think they know that that's it's the right way
 	
 	
 		right
 		they've picked up the habit well they do and when they actually get out away from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> and have to do their own buying of things
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yes and they appreciate how much it costs to do that
 	
 	
 		then and then they say well hey you know <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mom</ENAMEX> used to do this and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> used to do that and pretty soon they're they're figuring out that's not such a bad way to go but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that's right
 		that's true yeah
 		well i don't know you know i i wonder how how you instill in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> the necessity for doing just a little bit extra to to make this whole thing work i mean the extra like washing out bottles and jars or
 		the extra of actually uh making sure that uh you take stuff over to you know some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are complaining now are complaining because the stuff isn't picked up at the curbside you know and i think golly <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moses</ENAMEX> you just
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		do your part you know <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are not you you you can't be waited on all your life and expect things to always have work out out
 	
 	
 		right well see this this is what concerns me you over in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> they don't have the kind of waste we do here
 	
 	
 		no that's right
 	
 	
 		you you've got to be in a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> even in in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> you don't see things thrown away like we do here
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		right yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		i mean what we throw away is is a ransom a king's ransom to most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and i and even to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in our <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> who scavenge for food and
 	
 	
 		yes
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		and and i i think you have to
 		get into a period of need before  you can't tell a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> that lives in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred two hundred three hundred thousand</NUMEX> dollar house
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		that have all that they need and all that they could want that they've got to be careful this is uh i this is why i thought <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jimmy Carter</ENAMEX> was never very popular very positive  you know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		no
 		uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> didn't like him
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		because he
 		tried to say turn off the lights  conserve this do that and and uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> i nob <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ody</ENAMEX> wanted to hear it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah right do those little things yeah that make a lot of difference uh-huh
 		yeah yeah it's i you know and i think you're right though i think that it has to really hit home before the message sometimes or you have to grow up with it being important important in your life um oh oh um before the message really takes hold sometimes and
 	
 	
 		it's it's uh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um i don't know it's
 		uh  it's just really interesting to me how now more aware of things i am than i even myself than i used to be <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few years ago</TIMEX> i mean like i i'd go to the um to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">um cafeteria</ENAMEX> for lunch sometimes
 	
 	
 		right
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and they use <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">styrofoam plates</ENAMEX> when they wouldn't need to use styrofoam plates
 	
 	
 		um
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know and i think to myself that's that's crazy i wonder if you know maybe i need to bring that to someone's attention you know and and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh i'm seeing more and more of that and and i think it's uh just <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McDonald's</ENAMEX> effort to reduce the number of of styrofoam uh boxes that they use for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hamburgers</ENAMEX> and stuff i think is a good good example you know that even industry is willing to do it
 	
 	
 		right
 		huh
 		i i think the big question too we're looking at is would you be willing to pay more for a product so it can be recycled
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well i think that may that's kind of what it's coming to i'm sure
 	
 	
 		it um
 		that's that's right and and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		do we have to wait until all the landfills are full
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and there is nowhere else to put our garbage or and i don't with the mind set
 	
 	
 		that's right yeah
 	
 	
 		of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> public i think what they will do is start paying <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> to take our trash
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		wow that doesn't wouldn't surprise me uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that isn't that isn't harmful
 		or they will go dump it out in the middle of some ocean
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah uh
 	
 	
 		that's the way we solve problems and it's sad
 	
 	
 		i know it and unfortunately
