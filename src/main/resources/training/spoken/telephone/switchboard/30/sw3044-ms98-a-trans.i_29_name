 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay so uh what do you do with your lawn
 	
 	
 		oh i just i just mow the lawn that's about all i ever do
 	
 	
 		uh-huh do you put any <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fertilizer</ENAMEX> or anything like that
 	
 	
 		um
 		not really to speak of
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um
 		when i was little we used to use uh like uh chicken <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">manure</ENAMEX> and
 		cover the whole <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">lawn</ENAMEX> with it
 		and then uh plant uh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bermuda</ENAMEX>  mostly
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		and how about uh like landscaping or the you know <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">bushes or flowers</ENAMEX> or anything
 	
 	
 		um we had monkey grass
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and a wax leaf ligustrums
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		and do you like take care of those in anyway as far as uh feeding them or
 	
 	
 		well the freeze it's really it's bad here because the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last couple of years</TIMEX> the freeze has been real bad
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i had to hack them off a little bit
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and um
 		and it left most of them dead in in a lot of places it they just killed them right off
 	
 	
 		oh did it
 		right right
 		well we have we just moved in and we're uh kind of our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">yard</ENAMEX> has been left untended mostly for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about six years</TIMEX> so there's a lot of clover growing in it and everything
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh so we're trying to do is kill to to kill back all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">weeds</ENAMEX> and the clover and let so the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">grass</ENAMEX> can grow
 		and a number of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">bushes</ENAMEX> uh there's a lot of boxwood <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">bushes</ENAMEX> and all that were overgrown so we had to trim those all back you know to to nice and round because they were kind of sticking out all over the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sidewalk</ENAMEX> and everything
 		and there was some uh some juniper that was uh absolutely huge covering up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> the driveway just about so we had to cut it all back so you can park the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> in it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh mostly what we're doing since we got a yard service to our lawn service to help <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fertilize uh seed</ENAMEX> aerate the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">lawns</ENAMEX> uh so that uh you know we can get it back up to speed and to and and to get
 		get it all green again and i was gonna watch what i was gonna to do is watch them
 		throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> and see what kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fertilizer</ENAMEX> they use and uh then i'd just repeat it from then on myself
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh we're also kind of looking at uh a little bit of landscaping as far as putting some uh azaleas in with uh you know different white azaleas and red azaleas and purple azaleas you know to give a little color into the
 		into the landscape there
 		and uh you know put a couple of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> around our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">deck</ENAMEX> in the back and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> in the front with the existing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> uh to give a little color and everything
 		uh do you do anything like that or
 	
 	
 		um  not very much um just um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		we had some hanging uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> in the on the porch and um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and a few <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> on the inside
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		that was about it
 	
 	
 		you know some of the things that i've seen around here too is that a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> uh there's kind of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> ways to to that i've seen to cheaply fertilize your yard
 		and one was to uh i guess a big thing around is a called a composter
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know where you have you heard of that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		oh yeah whether you you know you put your whatever different grass clippings and all that in and and you let it sit there for a while and it kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cooks</ENAMEX> or something as as it decomposes
 		and we sort of have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> by guess by accident that's in our backyard and so we're thinking about using some of that to spread around you know the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">the the bush beds</ENAMEX> and flower beds and stuff
 		but another thing that uh one of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> is doing and it it his yard looks really good is that he's not using any of the he's not collecting any of the um
 		uh the the uh grass that he mows up at all he just let's it sit right back into the grass you know doesn't collect it in a bag or anything
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and by doing that i guess it sort of acts like it's own fertilizer
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and uh it just makes the grass real thick and and green and everything and it doesn't cost anything
 	
 	
 		yeah they have a they have a mulching blade now it cuts the cuts the grass up real fine and you don't have to you don't  you can't even see it when it falls into the grass it it just penetrates right through to the ground
 	
 	
 		oh you mean so that's a separate blade
 	
 	
 		well i don't know exactly what it does but it cuts the grass a lot finer than than uh the old mowers used to do
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		uh-huh do you think that that's like uh a blade that you can put on any mower or is it a special lawn mower the whole thing
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh it's a special blade i mean they have mulching mowers but then they have a mulching uh mulching attachment too
 	
 	
 		oh really huh
 	
 	
 		that you can put on other mowers
 	
 	
 		oh i'll have to look for that i didn't know it was a separate blade
 	
 	
 		i think i think it's double-edged
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and it cuts it back and forth
 	
 	
 		oh okay oh i'll have to look for that because that that would sure help us yeah i thought it was i thought it was just i don't know something special on the engine too as well or something
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		huh have to look for that well is there anything else you'd like to say
 	
 	
 		uh no that's about it
 	
 	
 		okay well it was very nice talking to you
 	
 	
 		nice talking to you
 	
 	
 		okay take care bye-bye
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">good-bye</ENAMEX>
