 		because uh we had we packed to cool off you know brought short sleeve sweaters and everything and we just died it was really hot so but i like it here i wouldn't i wouldn't trade it for snow <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">any day</TIMEX> yeah
 	
 	
 		oh my gosh
 		huh
 		really
 		see i like i like the snow but i like to watch it fall and i just like it where it's deep enough you know but not too deep
 	
 	
 		right and i can handle a vacation in it and
 		you know but my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> is from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Jersey</ENAMEX> and he wouldn't go back either he did all the shoveling and everything else he said it was a pain so
 	
 	
 		really
 		
 
 		well is it weird at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas time</TIMEX> without snow
 	
 	
 		no i don't think so well see <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> we had snow at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> time
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so it really wasn't it was weird because we had snow  it's like wow it actually fell on the right day so uh no it's not in fact uh you know we're used to running around in
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know Spring clothes in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December</TIMEX> and so when it throws in a real cool
 		winter we get broken pipes and and all that kind of stuff and because <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> is just just isn't built for you know real cold weather for long periods of time
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well it's real dry down there you don't have the humidity either do you
 	
 	
 		no not not where we are now in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Houston</ENAMEX> stuff they've got it
 		they've got it where no hair <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spray</ENAMEX> works
 		it's so humid at times but here it's it's just about right it's it's pretty dry and not too dry where you know you just it hurts to breathe but we're just about right we're just having this all this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rain</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		late rain has made it kind of uncomfortable made it the humidity real high but no i like it well we're right in a good stop because we're
 	
 	
 		yeah muggy huh
 	
 	
 		you know we get over in the over the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX> but it's it's not it's a dry heat and it's not really
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		as hot and muggy as it would be being over <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">hundred</NUMEX> plus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ninety</NUMEX> degree humidity <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">ninety percent</NUMEX> humidity
 	
 	
 		yeah see that's what's bad up here is when we do get the real
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		you know <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundred</NUMEX> and the high nineties we have the humidity to go with it so you're like real mucky and you you know your legs stick together just from walking you know so um
 	
 	
 		oh
 		yeah
 		yeah i know what
 		so we like it where we're at if it's not a whole bunch of everything at once type stuff
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so
 		but no it's interesting when it gets really cold here and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> forget that they're live in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> and they don't know how to drive in snow and you know but uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i wouldn't trade it for anything  i was born in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> and i visited other areas and i'm just a sun person i think gotten used to it
 	
 	
 		oh that's good
 		
 
 		well i don't know well
 		i guess that's really about all
 	
 	
 		yeah weather is not real hard to talk about  it doesn't last real long either i thought the weather is the last thing you talk about but in this case it's the only thing to talk about but well <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michelle</ENAMEX> it's great talking to
