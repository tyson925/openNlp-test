 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		do you have any
 	
 	
 		i'm trying to think off hand i can't think of anything you know
 	
 	
 		i have i have one it's it's and it's a real pet <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">peeve</ENAMEX> of mine it seems i i do work during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> and when i'm home uh you know i'm either cooking or running doing things or uh laundry or stuff and i hate when the phone rings
 	
 	
 		okay
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		
  
 	
 	
 		and it turns out to be a telephone salesman
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and it's real two there're <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> pet peeves about it number one i really feel that that's my private you know my own home
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i hate and if i want something i will get it i will go out and get it myself and i will never i never buy anything from a telephone salesperson
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		oh i wouldn't either no
 	
 	
 		so i really feel that it is a real invasion they're invading my time and my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">space</ENAMEX> by uh you know interfering in whatever i'm doing for and i it really bothers me
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um it's a little bit like junk mail but except you can't you know ignore it uh quite as easily and i i try to be polite but at the same point
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 		that doesn't always work
 	
 	
 		well i just say thank you very much for calling but i'm not interested and then i hang up before they can say anything
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yes and it works very well  because you don't hear you don't have they can say anything they want it's just but i just feel that's my big thing on the invasion of my thing on invasion of privacy
 	
 	
 		oh oh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and um
 		i have i sort of have a thought like you can
 		prevent yourself from getting junk mail by getting yourself off of mailing lists
 		i wish that there were a way that you could um get your telephone you know submit your telephone number to the phone <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> and have a penalty
 		for anyone who calls you to sell things from a business
 	
 	
 		um-hum well how do you get your name off the junk mailing list
 	
 	
 		uh you you you you do that by uh um the postal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">service</ENAMEX> has some information which you fill out and they send it's for every <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> i mean you can't do it for any company
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know but you can then send it and they can prove they tell that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>'s not allowed to sent it you any junk mail if you get junk mail on a regular basis from any particular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> you can
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		oh i didn't even know that
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah you have to go to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">post office</ENAMEX> and ask them for the form that you fill out to
 		not to get you know junk mail from specific companies
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		and i wish there were something like that where you can call the telephone <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> and you could say that uh have your name your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">number</ENAMEX> put in a registry and then anyone making these calls has to check that registry for that area
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and could not should and is not allowed under penalty of you know being reported or something to call you
 	
 	
 		
  
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so that would be one way of doing it
 	
 	
 		i can't really think of anything that invades my privacy but one of my pet peeves you came up with the telephone is
 		when you have an answering machine and they hang up before
 		they leave a message
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i can't stand that
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i think that is so stupid you know because
 	
 	
 		oh i'm guilty of that sometimes because i've called and there really wasn't any significant message and i and i wasn't going to be available to be called back
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and it was sort of like oh the hell i'm not going to spend the time giving and leaving a message and uh i'll call later  if i'm available the other thing that um that there is recourse to and that's another thing is
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		when you you use your credit card and then they ask for a telephone number
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		well legally legally now they're not allowed they're not you do not have to give a telephone number
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yes and i don't really like announcing in public
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know when you're sitting there my telephone and i don't like the the the way telephone numbers can be used we once had a situation where someone was using a credit card number of ours and he actually had our phone number but it turned out it had to been my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>'s office phone number
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh we were able we weren't actually able to trace it but we were able to to discard the charges um but it was
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		i don't like how they ask the i i realize that this is your identification but i worked with someone that got hold of his charge cards and his social security number
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah same with my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> it was a charge card and social security number
 	
 	
 		and you know i don't i don't like i don't get ever get anything over the phone because i don't want to give my social security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">number</ENAMEX> out
 	
 	
 		well you should never give the social security number
 		uh if sometimes if you charge sometimes i charge theater tickets
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		over the phone and then you know because they pick them up at the box office will call
 		but um that's the only thing i would ever have ever used it for the phone and that was because i initiated it
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> and occasionally i do order things from catalogs
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		over the phone but again it's i initiate it not the company
 		the other thing is though you do not have to if you're buying something in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX> and they ask and you pay for it by charge
 		and they ask you for your telephone number you do not have to give it that is one that's a law that went into effect i don't know <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year or two</TIMEX> ago
 	
 	
 		oh i never even knew that
 	
 	
 		and uh you can just say i'm sorry that you uh i'm not required to give that by law and then they won't uh a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> will still ask
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but uh the credit card <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> you know accepts the charges i mean it's a responsibility the credit cards <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>'s responsibility
 	
 	
 		um-hum well is there any like pet <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">peeves</ENAMEX> that you have that don't necessarily invade your privacy
 	
 	
 		so what and this
 		um well this it would this is limited to the privacy issue the invasion of privacy
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		yeah and i guess uh that was my that's probably my biggest one in terms of invasion of privacy for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of course i've got little pet peeves you know with my family
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you you know but of course that that i guess that just comes with the uh with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">territory</ENAMEX> with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> that does a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> you lose some privacy
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		i really can't think of any that would invade my privacy
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		um-hum nothing that you felt that you know any experiences you've had at work
 	
 	
 		you know
 		hm no i you know other i i really can't say anything that would really bother me
 	
 	
 		so many things i think over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</TIMEX> have been um accepted i mean when you uh that are no longer done
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i mean i can remember when i was very young much younger and i applied for a job they said well don't aren't you planning to have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> well i mean that's none of their business
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and but of course now by law they can't ask that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so i mean there has been i think a lot to done to protect privacy
 	
 	
 		yeah especially between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> and you know like age and all that stuff
 	
 	
 		how do you feel
 	
 	
 		you know with sex you know your sex with you know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		they've they've gotten a lot with uh applications and stuff and they're not allowed to ask
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that's right do you feel that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> testing is an invasion of privacy
 	
 	
 		no because i think it's for the better of like it you mean like for working and stuff
 	
 	
 		or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> testing
 		yeah um-hum
 	
 	
 		no i don't because i think whenever and something like that they're looking out for everyone they're not you know i think it's more safety than anything else
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i feel that way too i sometimes feel that you know sometimes individual rights including the right to privacy have to be sacrificed for a greater benefit
 	
 	
 		yeah because i know
 	
 	
 		you know for example  airline <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> i mean i do want my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot</ENAMEX> to be sober
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah because i know i worked at a still <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mill</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this summer</TIMEX>
 		and i know that um i've covered for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that came in drunk you know on the late shift or something
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		and it and it's dangerous i don't even like having them around i kind of do their work for them because they make it more hazardous than what it is without them
 		you know
 	
 	
 		that's right yeah i know i yeah i feel you know i think some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that oppose you know mandatory drug testing for certain areas say well it's not
