 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well i grew up out in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> and uh was used to having uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX> around the place and uh i'm
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i'm not for gun control in the strictest sense of the uh word
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		i i think i'm kind of bent towards middle <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">liberal</ENAMEX> of the bridge myself you know i have quite a collection myself and you know i'm a good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hunter</ENAMEX> and i
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		started hunting when i was twelve <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years old</TIMEX> of course my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> made me take <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hunters safety classes</ENAMEX> and you know i don't want to see them ban <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX> completely but i don't want them to completely turn loose of their controls either
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah well i i feel that its uh i think the what was it the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Rifle Association</ENAMEX> uh had this bumper sticker <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few years back</TIMEX> if uh about if you outlaw <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX> only outlaws will have <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX> then
 	
 	
 		so
 		i believe that
 	
 	
 		and i believe that too because the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> that's wanting to commit a crime is going to find a way to get a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">gun gun gun</ENAMEX> a knife a a rock a stick whatever it is to commit a crime with
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and it's the honest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> like ourselves that are responsible about use of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX> uh we can handle it but there's a element that can't
 	
 	
 		yeah and it's you know it's got to the point now where even our our police <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">departments</ENAMEX> and our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> and everything have to carry automatic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX> because everybody that's in drug trafficking trafficking has got them
 	
 	
 		you have got them outgunned
 	
 	
 		you know yeah so
 	
 	
 		there was a an article in the paper just <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</TIMEX> where i think it's uh
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the gun <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> i can't remember which was developing a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">ten millimeter ten millimeter</NUMEX>
 		automatic pistol for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> which would give them additional firepower it had held like a fifteen shot clip which uh would be able they they would be able to put down anything that came at them
 	
 	
 		um
 		yeah
 		yeah that would be
 	
 	
 		but if you figure you got some drug <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> out there that's got an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Uzi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">machine gun</ENAMEX> uh a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a a thirty eight</TIMEX> uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wesson</ENAMEX> revolver isn't going to do you much good
 	
 	
 		yeah that's
 		no it's sure not huh-uh
 	
 	
 		yeah i have lived in uh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Illinois</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time and they they passed a uh it wasn't really gun control but it was you had to register as a gun <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owner</ENAMEX> you didn't have to list your <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but you had to have this card it was like a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">driver</ENAMEX>'s license card that you had to have it in order to buy ammunition
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		and that's the first uh this was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty years ago</TIMEX> but they had that so that uh they were trying to control it a little bit uh in that respect
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		see in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> they
 	
 	
 		pardon
 	
 	
 		in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> they make you register when you buy ammunition
 	
 	
 		yeah uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you have to sign a they you know take your name and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">driver</ENAMEX>'s license <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">number hunter</ENAMEX> hunting license number and all that good stuff before you can buy any big ammunition
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		especially for handguns now <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">rifles</ENAMEX> aren't too bad but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know any kind of handgun at all if it will fit in a handgun and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">rifle</ENAMEX> you still have to buy it or sign up for it so
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		we lived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tennessee</ENAMEX> for awhile and i bought a pistol there and there was a fifteen day waiting period you had to fill out an application and go down to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sheriff</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> and get fingerprinted
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		gee
 	
 	
 		and then you had fifteen <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> while they checked to see if you had any kind of criminal record before that you could pick up the gun you were purchasing
 	
 	
 		gee that's not a bad idea
 	
 	
 		and no i think that uh you know a a waiting period uh can make a difference but again it's going to be the law abiding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizen</ENAMEX> that's going to comply with that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah yeah it is
 	
 	
 		so there's i don't think there's any way to control the criminal element as far as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX> is concerned because
 	
 	
 		no
 		the the only way they could do it i think would be to stiffen the penalties on anybody using a gun
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		you know i think if we kind of stiffen them up a little bit course i i feel kind of weird about that anyway i think if somebody shoots somebody they ought to be shot so
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm  we we're getting into capital punishment now  but i i agree with you there that uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah but you know
 		it would definitely be gun control
 	
 	
 		yeah the uh the again the purpose of gun control is to control how it's being used is what the purpose should be
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's not to keep <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> from buying a gun that need one for a specific purpose legal purpose but to keep the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> that's illegal from getting his hands on one
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		and i'm in favor of keeping the the illegal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> from getting <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> in his hands but the legal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> or lawful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> should not be penalized because there is the criminal element
 	
 	
 		myself
 		yeah well and the they're actually a necessity in life you know they're not you know not everybody needs a gun but
 	
 	
 		oh yes
 	
 	
 		sooner or later i need one you know whether i'm out hunting or you know i've never had to protect my life or well i did in the service but not you know not on the street
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so i don't really need <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> in the aspect in the aspects
 	
 	
 		you don't have to carry <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> in your <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> or your uh  or your pocket all the time yeah
 	
 	
 		no huh-uh
 		oh so mine are you know i use <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mine</ENAMEX> for recreation i don't and i enjoyed my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX> i have a good time with them so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		well i know what uh i took my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> out and taught them how to shoot a gun gun my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> the same thing uh she knows how to shoot any weapon that we have not not that i have an <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">arsenal</ENAMEX> or anything but we have several <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX> around the house
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of these days my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandkids</ENAMEX> probably
 	
 	
 		probably yeah
 	
 	
 		but i think it's uh you got to have have the places living in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> there's not that many places to go shoot
 	
 	
 		no huh-uh
 	
 	
 		but uh still i think they ought to know how to use <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> and it is not just a toy and that when
 		it's not like on TV when someone gets shot uh they get back up if someone gets shot with a real gun they don't get back up
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i had to explain that to my i've got a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six year old now and</TIMEX> and he you know i have a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fifteen year old</TIMEX> and a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seventeen year old</TIMEX> well they understand now
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know i've taken time to teach them and now the young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> wants to know and
 		you know like i told him you're a little bit young for a gun let me go out here and you know we'd start with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BB</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">gun</ENAMEX> deal you know so he started with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BB</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">gun</ENAMEX> and shot a couple of holes in a couple of windows and i took it away from him i said now
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know so he's learning the hard way but at least it was a BB gun not a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty two or a four ten</TIMEX> or something so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh
 		i remember i had an old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">uncle</ENAMEX> up by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tulsa Oklahoma</ENAMEX> that took me out and uh showed me this was it was not my it was my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">uncle</ENAMEX> this was a gentleman in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">his sixties</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		gee
 	
 	
 		and he took me out with him and uh single shot <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty two</TIMEX> and taught me how to shoot we went squirrel hunting and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		all right
 	
 	
 		and uh he taught me how to shoot uh an old single shot <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty two</TIMEX> and i probably i was probably about twelve at the time and i thought that was the neatest thing at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Uncle Sam</ENAMEX> took me out took me hunting with h im and he let me shoot and showed me how
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 		all right
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i think there is a lot of responsibility on any of us gun <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> to make sure that whoever is around us is at least safe and knows how to use one
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know i don't want to get out there <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">deer</ENAMEX> hunting and have some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> blow me away so
 	
 	
 		oh  yeah
 		well that's about all i we agreed pretty well on this i think so okay well it's been real nice talking with you okay bye
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah i think so uh
 		all right have a good one bye-bye
