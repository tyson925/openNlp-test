 
     		
 	
 		what would you serve at a dinner party
 	
 	
 		well that would have to depend on the uh number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and the nature of the party fairly small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that i know i tend to be a little bit more casual and i would tend to
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		to uh serve things that were buffet style perhaps we'd have uh
 		oh i like those little little <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocktail sausages</ENAMEX> in barbecue <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sauce</ENAMEX> or or maybe a sausage ball uh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">crackers</ENAMEX> and dips chips maybe uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		probably have some kind of a of a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salad uh</ENAMEX> that's easy to pick up and spread
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		fresh veggies probably uh possibly uh blocks of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cheese</ENAMEX> and chunks of uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">deli</ENAMEX> meat
 		have to include some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX> of some kind i prefer berries uh like sugared <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grapes</ENAMEX> and things that are very attractive to set out on a on a table
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		a little bit more formal dinner party you might have just a little bit more formal setting i don't have a lot of formal dinner <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> so i can't tell you a whole lot about that
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but i tend to be very lazy and want to do what is easy but looks and tastes good so
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		ours would lean more toward uh i guess monetary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concerns</ENAMEX> rather than the formality of the deal if if we were having a bunch of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> over if there were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> coming over we'd end up serving anything with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chicken</ENAMEX> due due to its cheapness
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh  oh you can run a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a</NUMEX> a regular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spaghetti</ENAMEX> or even a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chicken spaghetti</ENAMEX> type casseroles anything that that can be spread over a large number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> for a few number of dollars
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh  oh if it's smaller and and for a given occasion my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> will will end up cooking a variety of of uh shall i say more fancy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> as it were but
 		i grew up in a  in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> that that had a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a few</NUMEX> formal things but uh
 		my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> was deaf and and hung around the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> a lot so she developed a uh a cooking habit that was just unmatched by most of her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peers</ENAMEX> and we ate some very
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		good food and then large quantities of it and even to this day with the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of them uh retired and and none of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> at home and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		they still keep a large refrigerator totally full i i just can't imagine i mean even our refrigerator with a family of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> does not have the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> content that they manage to do  so she still likes to to cook a large uh variety of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 	
 	
 		my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> on the other hand comes out of the military type <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> and and they were always on the go and they never really had a a formal setting as it were and so she tends to cook a little more uh
 		informal type things and when we have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> over it's usually just for a uh a light
 		pretty much what we would eat anyway a light informal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meal</ENAMEX> and they usually bring something a desert or a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salad</ENAMEX> or whatever and uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i do like the uh  my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>'s motto when she finds something she wants to experiment on she'll experiment on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> because usually they're polite enough to eat it anyway  instead of the
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		family you know so so we do get some weird concoctions on occasion that she'll she'll experiment on things she has a real uh nice repertoire of uh desserts and uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i like to like to eat desserts
 	
 	
 		well
 		in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX> i have become far more conscience of conscious of balancing the diet and having healthy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> if i were having <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> over i would want
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		healthy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> to be one of the considerations most of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> really would prefer a bowl of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX> as opposed to a big gooey cake
 	
 	
 		hm interesting
 	
 	
 		uh they would prefer fresh stick veggies as opposed to chips and dips although there are some hard crust chips and dippers uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i i'd like to have a little bit of nutrition content in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> i'll be careful but for example about the kind of cracker that i pick to go under a spread
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		i may be concerned about the number of calories that are going into the spread i know i watch my weight and i'm sure that most of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> do too and i appreciate somebody being conscious of that when i go visit
 		so i do try to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cook</ENAMEX> more healthy than i did even <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five years ago five years ago</TIMEX> i let my palate dictate uh now i'm more conscious along with everybody else
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah that's interesting that's an interesting discipline i haven't uh i i probably should pay attention to that i i now that i think about it uh it does seem to be a bit of a change in what i've been served at different <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</TIMEX> uh
 	
 	
 		about the kind of food uh-huh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		well there was a time for example that i would've made a big gooey creamy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pie</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dessert</ENAMEX> now now i may use an angel food <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cake</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX> and a light whipped topping
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh</ENAMEX> hm
 	
 	
 		far fewer calories and far less <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> uh
 	
 	
 		and just as edible  very balanced very good yes yes
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX> and just as palatable i love <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peaches</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">strawberries</ENAMEX> and i sure take advantage of them in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah that's that's a good deal
 	
 	
 		and uh as far as the the party <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">snacks</ENAMEX> uh i may fix a trail mix or a caramel popcorn for snacking as opposed to what pure peanuts
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		right
 	
 	
 		yeah or or something else that that really is loaded with empty <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">nutrients</ENAMEX> with empty calories no nutrition
 	
 	
 		yeah popcorn has got to be one of the the most filling and least uh you know bad for you as it were and it seems to be good in all those categories that they're rating these days
 	
 	
 		oh yeah it's a favorite uh-huh uh-huh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh yeah uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		few calories and few <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">well</ENAMEX> if you don't drench it in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">butter</ENAMEX> i guess
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well i tend to i i  nearly everything i try to balance uh you can take everything to an extreme
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		right
 	
 	
 		everything to an extreme and i'm not going to take the flavor and the pleasure out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> in order to make it quote healthy i'd rather die than eat terrible tasting food
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah
 		pure <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oats</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah and there are you know you
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> whose systems are accustomed to that kind of discipline can actually tolerate it much better than those who are not i know that when i began to add <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bran</ENAMEX> to my diet i had terrible bellyache  until i until my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> became accustomed to it
 	
 	
 		hm
 		interesting
 	
 	
 		and uh by the same token when my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> and i <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> married he was accustomed to a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a greasy</TIMEX> diet lots of fried foods and i nearly died then  because i was accustomed to fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetables</ENAMEX> and baked <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meats</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		huh
 	
 	
 		or broiled <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meats</ENAMEX> or grilled meats i prefer my meat grilled to fried anytime i may do a little stir fry or a little wok or something like that but i do not fry my <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> that much anymore used to but i don't anymore
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> reasons one it's just not that healthy and it makes my stomach upset second it's a big mess to clean up  i'm not interested in cleaning up a mess
 	
 	
 		i'll say
 		yeah it's been <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple years</TIMEX> we got rid of our deep fryer we used to have one of those little bitty <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby fryers</ENAMEX> and we'd uh do everything from uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh yeah
 		uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fondues</ENAMEX> to  some other little uh meats even the uh <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bread</ENAMEX> we used to actually do in in uh <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> toast as it were in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oils</ENAMEX> but uh now it's just more like a grilled piece of uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bread a a</ENAMEX> that's interesting i hadn't i hadn't really thought about the changes that have occurred i guess the whatever <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> is moving us toward healthy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> is doing well the whole <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> seems to be moving slowly that way
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		well of course now we're going to find out <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</TIMEX> down the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> that we've done something terrible and our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> is going to
