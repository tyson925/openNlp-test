 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> that's that's a nice nice place to visit it's really nice uh there's a nice nice train ride that goes up to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Silverton</ENAMEX> where they used to do a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">silver</ENAMEX> mining
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and uh and then actually north north of that is another <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> and
 		a smaller on a smaller scale i guess than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Silverton</ENAMEX> but uh and then there's <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lots</ENAMEX> and lots of real uh of mountains that are covered with uh boulders
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so i guess people <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jeep</ENAMEX> through that area and we didn't have a chance to do that but i sure would like to go back there and do that again
 	
 	
 		right
 		we're um
 		uh we haven't had a vacation in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several years</TIMEX> so so  be our <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> chance in awhile in awhile uh
 		we're going to go to uh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Destin Florida</ENAMEX> which is a
 		very nice beach <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">area</ENAMEX> if you're not familiar with it it
 	
 	
 		i haven't been but i've heard it's wonderful
 	
 	
 		oh it's it's gorgeous uh we used to go quite a bit uh
 		before i moved out here we were closer and uh used to  go almost
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every summer</TIMEX> uh and just just rent a condo
 		there on the beach uh there's quite a few uh there's a lot of development of of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">condominiums</ENAMEX> there along the beach front
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		
 
 		so they have uh
 		they're very very large <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">condos</ENAMEX> and they have quite a few rooms
 		and uh so we we'll usually rent one for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about a week or so</TIMEX> and
 	
 	
 		right and the beach is nice the beach is really nice isn't it
 	
 	
 		and go down
 		oh yeah it's it just uh just beautiful white <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sand</ENAMEX> and very clear blue green <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> and uh a lot of
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		nice waves usually uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sea</ENAMEX> shells
 	
 	
 		enough enough to make it i'm sorry
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sea</ENAMEX> shells
 	
 	
 		uh there's not as many sea shells along there uh that's the only thing that they really don't they have some but not not so much um if you go further down uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but you'll usually find some but not right in there uh i don't know why it is but uh just
 		it seems not to not to have as many there but uh we we enjoy it uh it's the place where we stay is we stay we usually stay at the same place <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every year</TIMEX> and
 		
 
 		they are like i say right on the beach so it's uh
 	
 	
 		oh where do you stay and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> always wants to go to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Destin</ENAMEX> we just haven't gone that direction yet
 	
 	
 		it's a place called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Jetty East uh J E T T Y E A S T</ENAMEX>
 		and it's uh called that because it's at the very end of uh a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">jetty</ENAMEX> there which is uh sort of the end of this little little point and uh it's a at the very end it's the last set of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">condominiums</ENAMEX> there and it's uh
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		it's very nice uh it's not very expensive uh you can i think we're going to go with another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> and their their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> and uh
 		they have a we have a uh
 		i think it's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedroom</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedroom uh condominium</ENAMEX> which will sleep
 		i don't know quite a few uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six or eight</NUMEX> and uh
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		because it's got you know pull out couches and all that and uh i think it's going to cost us per <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">couple about three</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">hundred dollars</NUMEX> for the week
 	
 	
 		oh  that's nice
 	
 	
 		yeah it really is because um the uh
 		you know it's got its own <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen</ENAMEX> full size <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen</ENAMEX> and everything and this one i think has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">baths</ENAMEX> and it's the one we got is on the uh on the beach side so
 	
 	
 		right
 		oh nice

 		uh in fact we stayed there on on our honeymoon we i had won a trip to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bahamas</ENAMEX> but didn't get to take it on our honeymoon time so we instead went there uh
 		and loved it just as much as as if we had gone to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bahamas</ENAMEX> we in fact we stayed an extra day or so because we liked the uh the particular room uh uh uh
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		uh <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">suite</ENAMEX> that we had gotten was very nice and so we decided to stay
 	
 	
 		right
