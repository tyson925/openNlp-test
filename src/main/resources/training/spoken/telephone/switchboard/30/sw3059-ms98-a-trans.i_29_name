 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay
 		um the last movie that i have seen it's been it's been <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of months</TIMEX> i saw um
 		Sleeping with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Enemy</ENAMEX> and Flatliners those were the last <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> that i've seen
 	
 	
 		yes i saw that one
 		what was the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> one
 	
 	
 		Flatliners
 	
 	
 		i didn't see that one
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		did you see those because of uh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Julia Roberts</ENAMEX> or
 		for uh the subject matter of the two
 	
 	
 		oh it was just well someone had i had seen the advertisement for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Flatliners</ENAMEX> on TV and i thought i'd like it and then uh one of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> who went to see <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Sleeping with the Enemy</ENAMEX> and she told me to go it was good so that's why i saw that one
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		well i've uh  i saw <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Sleeping with the Enemy and i um</ENAMEX>
 		i've seen uh
 		well just recently um
 		What About Bob
 	
 	
 		no i haven't gotten to see any you know any real recent ones
 	
 	
 		well that one is uh
 		it's cute but kind of far out comedy
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i like comedies better than i do dramas
 	
 	
 		yeah i uh am not one for the uh
 		i don't need the suspense movies or the
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		the movies with lots of uh the horror movies with uh
 		trying to shake you out of your chair
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		did you care for <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Sleeping with the Enemy</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um
 		i'm not sure  i uh
 		i saw it
 		and uh because my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> wanted to see it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh but on the other hand i'm not sure i would have gone otherwise and having gone
 		uh
 		well it really wasn't on a theme that i was uh
 		uh that into or as i say the i prefer the light movies that
 		uh my
 		style of entertainment is
 		is comedy
 		uh primarily
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well i didn't care for the movie myself
 	
 	
 		and then into action films
 		what
 	
 	
 		i didn't really care for the movie either
 	
 	
 		yeah you kind of have to like to be uh
 		drawn to this point where you aren't sure what's going to happen
 	
 	
 		yeah uh-huh well okay on likewise then did you see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pretty Woman</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh yes
 	
 	
 		do you enjoy that one
 	
 	
 		uh it was interesting but i felt that one was a bit farfetched
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh in that
 		well
 		i'm trying to think of the other one i saw recently the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">um Defending Your Life</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh i haven't even heard of that one
 	
 	
 		well that was one where uh it's kind of like to me it's somewhat like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pretty Woman</ENAMEX> the the story line um if you accept a few of the basic starting points i guess the rest falls in place
 		uh it was hard to accept that uh
 		this uh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">multimillionaire wheeler</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealer</ENAMEX> would uh
 		this uh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">multimillionaire wheeler</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealer</ENAMEX> would uh would you know find himself and allow himself to get into that situation
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah well i really liked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pretty Woman</ENAMEX> you know i just well you just kind of went with it like you said you had to accept the beginning of it and just kind of go
 	
 	
 		yeah it's sort of a modern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cinderella</ENAMEX> type of story
 	
 	
 		yeah but um <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Flatliners</ENAMEX> now it's a drama and i don't usually like them and i really enjoyed it
 		i um i don't know it was kind of it made you think a lot i think did you see Ghost
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yes
 	
 	
 		okay now did you care for that one
 	
 	
 		uh that was i enjoyed that one
 		i
 		in that
 		i i guess i i hate to be too surprised in a movie and in that one you could you could pretty well guess where it was going to end up you weren't sure exactly
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		how it would get there but you knew where it would end up
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		see now i didn't
 		i thought it was an okay movie but it wasn't something that i would enjoy seeing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twice or three</NUMEX> times
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i didn't think so um i really didn't care for the ending of it i thought it was just of like  you didn't know this was going to happen when you know but um
 		i don't know you know well of course uh a bunch of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> had told me and warned me and they said oh it's a real tearjerker and  meanwhile i sat through the movie and said well when are you when are you supposed to start crying you know  i didn't really
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well whenever she starts crying
 	
 	
 		uh i didn't really find it to be a tearjerker
 	
 	
 		well do you go to many movies more than once
 	
 	
 		um if i see them more than once i see them on video i never pay to see <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> more than once
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know
 		but like you said i i enjoy the comedies a lot better
 		in fact that's where i've seen most of my movies have been on video
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these days</TIMEX> it's
 		uh
 	
 	
 		you see it on video just as soon as it is on the movie screen
 	
 	
 		well if you don't with some of the movies if you don't go to them within
 		the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four weeks</TIMEX> the movie may have
 		uh left town never to show up again until it comes back in video
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so uh unless a movie is popular and stays around
 		uh
 		you probably will see it on video <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these days</TIMEX> more likely than at the movie
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so we have um
 		well i think just most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have VCRs now and we probably watch twice as many movies at home
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		as we do at movie <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">theaters</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		no i saw one it was a drama also and i can't think of the name of it now
 		that um
 		it was a book before it came out in a movie
 		and it was it was it was a drama it wasn't a comedy
 		uh
 	
 	
 		did you go to <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dances With Wolves</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		no i wanted to see that i didn't get to
 	
 	
 		i at least what i hear on that one that it's coming out a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> time in a
 		in a longer version
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		even though it was a long movie it's sort of the uncut version
 		at least that was some of the rumors we'll have to see because it's
 		uh there was some talk about that i maybe it will come out <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this fall</TIMEX> there we're sort of in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the middle of the summer</TIMEX> um
 		season of a lot of new movies coming out but then there's these um periods like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early fall before Christmas</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early spring</TIMEX> when there's sort of a quiet period where if you bring something out again
 		it uh
 		will increase the revenues from the movie
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		well um what movies are showing down there now
 	
 	
 		oh i i'd actually have to get a newspaper out my approach to movies is i kind of hear about them
 		uh i keep track of them a little but you know ask me to name the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> that are out there right now
 		and i'd have to say
 		uh i uh i don't know i i just lo ok at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX> before i decide to go and
 	
 	
 		yeah that's pretty much what i do i i know for sure that that one about what was that one about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bob</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh it's kind of
 	
 	
 		i think it's just
 	
 	
 		Where's <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bob or What About Bob</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah i think it's just playing now up here
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		because some of them they uh they'll start in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> area of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> and if they
 		it's
