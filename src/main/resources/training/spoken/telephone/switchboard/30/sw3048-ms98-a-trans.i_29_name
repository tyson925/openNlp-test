 		just into uh <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> grade or so i was sitting there wondering whether this war would ever stop and whether it'd last <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">another five or six years</TIMEX> and i would end up in it and uh i i kept a little bit of an eye on it i had older
 		sisters that wasn't was not worried about going in to it but they had <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy friends</ENAMEX> and the like that were concerned and so it struck home a little bit from that standpoint we didn't have any service <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vietnam</ENAMEX> there in the immediate family so
 		uh
 		just the whole idea though of of what we were over there for and uh the very unpopular
 		problems that occurred here the riots and the protests and uh it just didn't seem to go over well with the general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> like the last one did uh it it raised it to the forefront of of a lot of our thinking back then so
 		uh i i would tend to say that it was not worth it but then it's easier looking back at at the fact that we virtually lost if you want to call it that it's easy to say well yeah it was not worth it considering the results now had we won and it had been quick
 		uh maybe it would've been different but
 	
 	
 		i don't think so
 	
 	
 		i'm not really all that familiar i never was a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vietnam</ENAMEX> buff i'm not all that familiar with the beginning of it
 	
 	
 		well my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> was my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> was in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nam</ENAMEX> my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> was in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nam</ENAMEX>
 		yeah you know i had a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nam</ENAMEX> so
 		it's like it hit it hit pretty close
 	
 	
 		well do you think the reasons are any different than than what they did in
 	
 	
 		the reasons that they did it now and the reasons that they did it then are still the same
 	
 	
 		uh just somebody invaded and they decided to go help huh
 	
 	
 		there is
 		it's
 		it's yeah
 		the only difference is is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> here
 		the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> now is going to back there but see they you can't take
 		like they you know they they are acknowledging the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vietnam</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vets</ENAMEX> now well but that's not going to work
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		because they are they were already misused when they came back and they're not going to forget that
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		so you know
 		and i know my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> won't he spent a lot of time so he came back totally screwed up
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		so you know i i blame a lot on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Uncle Sam</ENAMEX> because of the fact  you know they had it in your living room and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		stuff like that
 		and i don't i didn't like that at all
 		because it makes you worry more
 	
 	
 		yeah and i never thought about that the news coverage might be
 		worse than
 		it you would be better off not knowing i guess
 	
 	
 		in a way it is because then you don't have to really worry  that or if you see something and you you think it's your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> or you think it's somebody you know and they are dead and then you know you you done went haywire for nothing
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		it's just it's i think the war then was just as useless as it is now
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		but you know
 		should i it it's not really useless i guess really <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam</ENAMEX> if they were going to do it i think they should have just kept going
 	
 	
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		instead of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> doing the job
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		because the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> still over there is in trouble
 	
 	
 		yeah it makes you wonder if if they'd had the same mentality in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nam</ENAMEX> if they'd have been able to
 		to just wipe out the thing you know go all out as it were
 	
 	
 		instead of doing all this political stuff that's half the problem
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's too much political politics involved in a war you know they tell you you can't do this but you know what
 		everybody else does not do like the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> don't listen
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		they say we could not do certain things to them but they could do everything to us
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know and that's what makes it bad
 	
 	
 		the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX> about not going into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cambodia</ENAMEX> was that's bad news  that's right
 	
 	
 		yeah but they but they did you know so you know it's like uh-huh sure right  whatever you say
 	
 	
 		so
 		just
 		blow up any part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> that they are occupying regardless of the boundaries
 	
 	
 		just like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Storming Norman</ENAMEX> they should've let that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> loose
 	
 	
 		yep
 	
 	
 		they should've just let him loose in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> he would have just cleaned house i think he would have done better
 	
 	
 		hum
 		well that's uh
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		i wonder what the i have not even looked at the cost i wonder if the cost was anywhere comparable as far as what they spent per day or what they spent per month
 		in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nam</ENAMEX> versus what they spent here it's almost like we moved an entire
 		organization the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> and all all the support <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> all the everything over there whereas in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nam</ENAMEX> it was kind of a little at a time but it was so protracted i i guess the average cost of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a month</TIMEX> was probably less back in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nam</ENAMEX> than it was this time
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		yeah it was plus it was less but still if you take it back then and do the do the do the uh
 	
 	
 		i don't what the
 	
 	
 		what do you call it the average the cost of living there and do it now and do the cost of living it still gonna cost you money it'll cost you about the same
 	
 	
 		cost of living adjusting yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		i just didn't know how much support they gave them uh they didn't have
 		well like in this one they didn't have a whole lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USO</ENAMEX> type stuff to have to  put up or build <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> for it was all temporary
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but uh there there were bases that had permanent installation as far as entertainment and services went
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so i guess that cost a bit
 	
 	
 		and so you know see the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> don't realize it but the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX> and all that stuff that's still over there
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and then you think about it <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vietnam</ENAMEX> is how old and they still have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoners</ENAMEX> of war
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		see i don't think that is right i think the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> should but they put down and go over there and be and just go over there and go through it period you know
 		find out where they are some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> know the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> knows that's the bad part
 	
 	
 		yeah they certainly shouldn't continue to deal with them as far as monies go
 	
 	
 		no but here we are you know <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam</ENAMEX> wouldn't have been so bad if we had not gave him half the stuff he's got
 	
 	
 		yeah there is already talks of you know
 		dealing with them again it won't be long
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		well he'll be back
 	
 	
 		yeah i guess it's
 		i don't know whether it's better to know what your <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enemy</ENAMEX> has or  or you know fight against something you know is there or not have let him have anything i think i would rather not let him have anything
 	
 	
 		why give him the same advantage that you have
 	
 	
 		yeah certainly sell him lesser equipment
 	
 	
 		okay
 		yeah but nothing new but he had modern <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">equipment scud launchers</ENAMEX> i mean let's get real here those are <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mobile missile</ENAMEX> launchers
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		they do make a mess
 	
 	
 		and then <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> is not going to use them yeah right uh-huh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		so you know it's like what do you want to do first
 	
 	
 		i mean we certainly made a
 		a mess out of the ar eas that we bombed in the latest war too bad they couldn't do that kind of concentration on uh in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nam</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		they just were not allowed i mean it took <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> before they would even allow the bombing that is kind of
 		political  i have no other words for it
 	
 	
 		nope there's nothing else that you can do about it it is just
 		you know i think they should've done more
 		than what they did over there and i still think they should've done more  what they did over in uh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		because to me uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> went both these places and they made it worse for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that's there
 	
 	
 		hum  that's true that's true
 	
 	
 		so it depends on if you there you can see it if not then you will never know cause in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> never know what's going on
 		they just take whatever they get told
 	
 	
 		take whatever they are fed on the news and and go on
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		well i've got mister <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carruthers</ENAMEX> waiting for my attention so i had better let you go
 	
 	
 		mister who
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Carruthers</ENAMEX> from Plano yeah so he's
 	
 	
 		oh
 		tell him hi
 	
 	
 		all right will do
 	
 	
 		okeydokey
 	
 	
 		um bye
 	
 	
 		bye
