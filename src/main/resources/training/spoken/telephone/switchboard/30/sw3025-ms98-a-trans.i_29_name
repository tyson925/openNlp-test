 
     		
 	
 		
 
 		yep
 	
 	
 		okay i i do a fair amount of cooking
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i love having <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guests</ENAMEX> to dinner
 		i probably do that at about once a month
 		and uh
 		i usually prepare something depending upon the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guests</ENAMEX> you know if if i like to prepare <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chicken</ENAMEX> that seems to please please everybody <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pasta</ENAMEX> or a casserole how about you
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah those are things i like the most i like <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> and chicken the most
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		and um  most i cooking i do just comes out of a can
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		unless unless it is unless it is i catch a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> and i prepare it
 		and then i just uh you know i just broil it and put lemon on it
 	
 	
 		um-hum well that's about the way i prepare most fish
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh i made scallops <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the other night</TIMEX> that was unusual and uh
 		basically uh i found a recipe to to make it in the microwave
 		and you sprinkled the you you swished around a little melted <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">butter</ENAMEX> and do uh
 		oh i do not know microwave microwaved them for about
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nine</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> no no <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">four four and a half five minutes</TIMEX> and you had to add <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sesame seeds</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bread</ENAMEX> crumbs on top very simple but very nice
 		so if you are looking for a fish recipe that was good
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sesame seeds</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bread</ENAMEX> crumbs
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sesame seeds</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bread</ENAMEX> crumbs
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> liked it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh no unfortunately scallops are one of the more expensive
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">uh fish</ENAMEX> items
 	
 	
 		right uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but you know i i look for them to go on sale at the grocery store
 		uh
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the things i love to do eat out how about you
 	
 	
 		oh yeah uh-hum
 	
 	
 		do you have any particular places you like going
 	
 	
 		oh there's a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">String Bean</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spring Valley</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i like that it's just it's just home cooking
 	
 	
 		yes i've been there
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh i kind of kind of like the black eyed <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">pea</ENAMEX> but i don't think it's a chain
 	
 	
 		right exactly uh-huh and that's that's the other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX> also think they got black eyed pea
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so
 		i don't really like uh  you know uh chili places or what is it <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roy Bean</ENAMEX>'s or
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		i don't like greasy places
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i i i don't feel like they are very healthy and i always feel like the home cooking places are are the healthiest <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meals</ENAMEX> even though i tend to have chicken fried steak when i go go to them
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right and i and i got uh
 		chicken marinara the last <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> times you know
 	
 	
 		oh how was it
 	
 	
 		it was i was great because that's that's what i like i don't like it you know it's like a baked
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		you know a piece of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chicken</ENAMEX> and then i get like
 		green <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beans</ENAMEX> and mashed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">potatoes</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know
 		
 
 	
 	

 		yeah i i tend to uh i get teased by my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> a lot because uh i like experimenting on
 		on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> and sometimes i go for exotic fairly exotic
 		things and and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> teases me about gourmet cooking
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		which is not always true but  and the thing about experimenting with cooking or anything else is that some of the experiments fail
 	
 	
 		no that's true
 	
 	
 		uh the last time we had some uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> over for dinner i tried the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dessert</ENAMEX> that sounded wonderful wonderful in the recipe and it was just total bust
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i was sorry i didn't have <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice cream</ENAMEX> to fall back on
 	
 	
 		yeah my uh my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> tried to make a bunch of things uh way back he tried to make bagels <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time
 	
 	
 		oh my that's ambitious
 	
 	
 		yeah and uh  we took some and and we had uh <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shepherds</ENAMEX> at the time and we took some and gave it to the dogs
 		and the dog never you know he treated it like a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk bone</ENAMEX> and he never did finish it he barely made a dent in it
 	
 	
 		hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and and uh then he tried to make grapefruit citron <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it's uh supposed to be a candy
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh it it didn't turn out very well it was you know
 		it it like made concentrated all the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> of the grapefruit into uh
 		into a kind of a candy stick so
 	
 	
 		huh
 		see i am not that's interesting one of the things i don't make is dessert
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> accuses me of putting him through dessert deprivation because you know we have <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice cream</ENAMEX>  or something like that and that's why when i took did this
 		experiment for this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> we had <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about three weeks ago</TIMEX> it was just a total fiasco
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		huh
 	
 	
 		um
 		everything else was fine but that was a fiasco
 	
 	
 		well you have to put <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX> and everything don't you or
 	
 	
 		uh yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah just about
 	
 	
 		yeah and i i also don't have much of a sweet tooth so i can live without live without desserts for the most part
 	
 	
 		uh-huh use <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about half</NUMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sugar</ENAMEX> or
 		make everything diet
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh do you <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cook</ENAMEX> for yourself or do you <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cook</ENAMEX> for others
 	
 	
 		mostly i just <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cook</ENAMEX> for myself
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well when i was single i used to uh i think my favorite <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meal</ENAMEX> was a
 		a baked potato
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		it's easy that's for sure
 	
 	
 		and
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		oh yeah and i mean i never put anything other than a little <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">butter</ENAMEX> on it if i had or or if i had a little cheddar <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cheese</ENAMEX> sometimes i would grate that up
 	
 	
 		hum yeah i always put <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cheese</ENAMEX> on them
 	
 	
 		and uh amazingly satisfying
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 		but you know there's hardly any i guess there's hardly any <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> it's mostly starch
 		fills you up and then the cheese has to make up for whatever the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> you get
 	
 	
 		yeah i didn't i didn't say it was nourishing but it was satisfying
 	
 	
 		oh yeah it really is
 		then you have to make a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salad</ENAMEX> or
 	
 	
 		and
 		yeah
 		yeah that but you know um i i never really enjoyed cooking for myself so i ate very simply and i was
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		that's why i think that's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> reason i like having <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> over because i could try things i mean i must be a frustrated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chemist</ENAMEX> or something like that cause cooking is a little bit like like being in a chemistry lab
 	
 	
 		right
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		except you get to taste the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">product</ENAMEX> instead of
 	
 	
 		instead of having an explosion
 	
 	
 		
 
 		foam up or blow up or
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		sometimes it blows up anyway
 	
 	
 		oh yeah  you know
 	
 	
 		i i once had a an old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy friend</ENAMEX> over to to dinner when i was just briefly staying with my parents
 		and uh
 		i had this wonderful recipe and and you were supposed to make a a toffee like substance
 		for a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pie</ENAMEX> by uh boiling evaporated milk
 		<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three hours</TIMEX> and it does turn to toffee inside the can
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh the only problem was when i opened the can
 		it just flew all over the place it was on the ceiling on the walls and me and and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boyfriend</ENAMEX>
 		saw that he was supposed to be there at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">six o'clock</TIMEX> not <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">seven o'clock so</TIMEX> just at the time all this happened the door bell rang and there he was
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and i had to have my my my my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad sort</ENAMEX> of entertain him for a for  for awhile while my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> and i scrambled to clean everything up
 	
 	
 		right
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		did you let the can cool off
 	
 	
 		uh i really don't remember that was about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten years ago</TIMEX> i just remember
 		how embarrassing it was and i have made i have made it since i've i i and several times before and i never had that problem just that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		huh yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh he he was a gourmet cook he was kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> who
 		acted like he came from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> and he had a very sophisticated taste i i really wanted to impress the heck out of him and and  well it was a memorable <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</TIMEX> anyway
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh but i i do enjoy cooking so i was awfully glad i was given this
