 
     		
 	
 		okay well uh i guess uh you're pretty aware that it's uh been uh a little warm for this time of year
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		it uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">humidity</ENAMEX>'s a little higher
 	
 	
 		it is this is muggy <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> like it wants to rain but it don't know what it wants to you know
 		for this time of year
 	
 	
 		uh-huh you know about a month from now this wouldn't be so bad but uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of March</TIMEX> this is uh this is funny
 	
 	
 		no
 		really bad yeah funny weather but bad because that means it either means <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one or two</NUMEX> things it's going to be a bad <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX>  or a not too good <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> and a worse <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter next year</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh jeez
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well that's a good way to look at it
 	
 	
 		i always do that i got to do something like that with the weather
 	
 	
 		well if you do that then you'll only be pleasantly surprised probably if it's anything but that
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		that's uh
 		that's uh but uh i i guess <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the winter the winter</TIMEX> wasn't that bad down here really
 	
 	
 		no see that's it was a mild <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> that's why i keep saying oh no
 	
 	
 		
  
 		yeah looking looking forward to a really bad <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> and hot summer
 	
 	
 		yeah i think it's going to be really hot this year
 	
 	
 		well hopefully you know if it's humid now maybe it'll i remember <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> it rained an awful lot or uh you know for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last couple of years</TIMEX> it's rained an awful lot and maybe that'll help to defeat some of the heat
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and if uh if it rains a lot but uh
 		but uh
 	
 	
 		if it rains if it rains any more and gets really hot then we have this problem with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh yeah you're right yeah yeah i used to live in up north up in the upper <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">midwest</ENAMEX> and uh
 	
 	
 		see
 	
 	
 		and we had had mosquito mosquito problems that's for sure
 	
 	
 		well see i would prefer the cold
 		i'm from southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		but see the heat out here  ain't nothing
 	
 	
 		well you know it's it's that easy to say but boy when it's <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">forty</NUMEX> below and you're shoveling snow and it's <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">forty</NUMEX> below it's uh
 	
 	
 		no i don't want to get that cold now
 	
 	
 		it uh  that's just the bad thing you either you either have to take the take this kind of weather or uh or take the really really cold weather
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i don't think no i don't want to go no where up north no where
 	
 	
 		does it go in any any where north of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Red River</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">huh-uh</ENAMEX>
 		i don't even want to go anywhere yeah that's about it
 	
 	
 		that's uh i that's what i've heard <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> say is they'll never go north of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Red River</ENAMEX> again
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that's right it's too cold up there
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and then <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> that's when they really had that cold spell
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know it was like um
 		record breaking below temperatures and stuff in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alaska</ENAMEX> where your gas your <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> was freezing while it was running
 		you know the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas oil</ENAMEX> or the gas would turn to slush huh-uh see i can't handle that
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah i i know what you mean because uh because you got to have like little oil heaters where they plug in the uh plug in uh your car
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh that's not good that's not good at all and uh
 	
 	
 		no something happens then what
 	
 	
 		well i guess the only thing to do is to hope that this is the worse that it gets this year
 	
 	
 		yeah it's not that bad right now i just hope it don't get any worse
 	
 	
 		yeah or if it if it does get worse it doesn't stay for very long
 	
 	
 		that's about it i'm just waiting because see it's tornado <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh that's right that's right because
 	
 	
 		yes it is it's tornado <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		already already hit <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oklahoma</ENAMEX> and probably right down here soon so
 	
 	
 		um-hum you see this is this is tornado <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">weather boy people</ENAMEX> don't know it but when it gets hot like this
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and you know like they're predicting the weather to be cold well when it gets cold real fast
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		um-hum get a northerner through here
 	
 	
 		there's your tornados that's right and so they're predicting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this weekend</TIMEX> probably drop something like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> degrees i say huh-uh see that ain't right
 	
 	
 		that's right
 		no no
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		no it's uh
 	
 	
 		but that's that's tornado <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah and i guess i guess that's shows what they say about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> if you don't like the weather just just wait a day yeah it'll change on you
 	
 	
 		wait a while it'll change
 		that's right that's about like it is too because <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> was really nice
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and the wind was blowing but <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> is muggy but the wind is still blowing but you know
 		i don't know
 		the weather
 	
 	
 		well anyway i guess that's about all i got to say about the uh the weather
 	
 	
 		that's about it that's about all you can say about the weather
