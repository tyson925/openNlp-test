 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay you want to go first
 	
 	
 		well uh topic being the banking crisis uh that's a real hot topic
 		real real mess i guess you must say
 	
 	
 		yeah sure is
 		yeah it is
 		of course you you've you've had your fair share of that down your way too
 	
 	
 		oh yeah think uh
 		probably i guess it's pretty well wide spread <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> wide but i think <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texas</ENAMEX> probably uh
 		suffered and or caused the uh
 		the major or a good portion of it
 	
 	
 		no argument here yeah i i think that uh now i'm i'm no financial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX> but from what i've read and heard
 	
 	
 		that makes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of us
 	
 	
 		yeah i think there were some regulations on loans that were lifted that allowed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">savings and loans</ENAMEX> to make
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh riskier
 		uh investments and of course uh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> was uh one of the main things that were invested in oil and real estate and of course when oil when oil went south real estate went with it <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> were speculating in the future that
 		without anything to fall back on when prices on both of those went went uh down
 	
 	
 		yeah i understood that shaky uh real estate loans was probably the
 		the major culprit um with the oil crisis
 	
 	
 		well also in investments investments in oil <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ventures</ENAMEX> as well because it was predicted predicated on uh a certain price per barrel
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		to recover the costs of the loan and when oil went from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> dollars a barrel to
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twelve</NUMEX> dollars a barrel then that just wasn't any way to break even
 	
 	
 		yeah i guess that was the immediate cause
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh shoot i don't uh i tell you one thing as far as the way they're handling it i uh
 		i feel pretty strongly about this and that's i think they're over reacting as far as the the uh actions taken against their the little guy the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">depositor</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">customers</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		i think they uh they went way to far the other way in the spectrum
 		and on the other hand i don't
 	
 	
 		yep
 	
 	
 		know whether they're doing enough in the way of uh you know redressing the situation and bringing the uh the real
 		you know the
 		the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">presidents</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX> and those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that are uh really responsible to uh to justice on that
 	
 	
 		didn't didn't they just uh put another <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">another thirty billion dollar</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Band-Aid</ENAMEX> on the problem <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX> or something uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i'm not sure i didn't
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> approved some more money to bail them out
 	
 	
 		yeah it's going to be uh
 		it's uh your and my money that's doing that you know that's unfortunately
 	
 	
 		well that's true
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		of course it just adds to the to the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> deficit which adds to the overall debt of the nation
 		and uh at some point in time
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's either going to be repaid or just completely blown off
 		i'm not sure which which one is which i i really think our whole financial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> of cards waiting to collapse
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah well i guess the hope is that uh they can find some way to muddle through and the economy recover enough to uh to help uh get them out of it
 	
 	
 		yeah now i i'm a staunch <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> but uh you know for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last nine years</TIMEX> i've heard that that we would grow our way out of uh out of debt
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and after the longest sustained economic recovery in in i don't know how many <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX> it didn't happen
 		and uh
 		i don't know what it's what it's going to take to turn that around
 	
 	
 		that's a good point they uh
 		
 
 		they got a little uh
 		a little hesitation in the recovery here and uh hopefully they'll rebound from that in a fairly short period of time
 	
 	
 		yeah i think ending the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the Gulf War</ENAMEX> quickly was beneficial
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		definitely
 	
 	
 		uh let's see what were some of the other
 		other points she mentioned topic wise
 	
 	
 		uh do we think enough is being done to address it i
 		i i guess it had some blue ribbon panels look into it i don't i don't remember exactly what their findings and recommendations were
 	
 	
 		it seems to me like they really haven't uh at least they haven't
 		if they're doing anything it's still pretty much uh uh not out in the open it's uh you know behind the scenes kind of uh
 	
 	
 		right right
 		sure
 	
 	
 		panels or whatever you know <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committees</ENAMEX> or investigations
 		nothing uh
 		nothing that makes headlines that much has been done really i don't think
 	
 	
 		that's true although of course the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last six months</TIMEX> the headlines have been pretty well dominated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Persian Gulf</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		maybe now uh that we're putting that behind us that we'll be able to to address this in more depth
 	
 	
 		does tend to uh push that out of the front page
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well hey it's been real good talking with you
 	
 	
 		yeah this will be a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> i uh usually end up getting uh told i got <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three seconds</TIMEX> to wrap it up <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">or five seconds</TIMEX> or something like that
 	
 	
 		oh uh do they come on does something body come on the line and tell you to do that
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah i think uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time it was i think <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">ten minutes</TIMEX> was the maximum and another time it was uh ended by uh
 	
 	
 		oh
 		what's what's the
 	
 	
 		its capacity was short <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that day</TIMEX> or something
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		what's the minimum is that like <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three minutes</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		i don't think there is a i don't know if there is a minimum
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		so i'm uh satisfied we covered the topic on this end
 	
 	
 		i i think so too
 	
 	
 		nice talking with you
 	
 	
 		you bet bye-bye
 	
 	
 		bye-bye
