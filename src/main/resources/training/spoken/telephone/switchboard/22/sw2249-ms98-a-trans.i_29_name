 
     		
 	
 		where do you live
 	
 	
 		uh in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Houston</ENAMEX> area
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well i used to i lived there for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a long time</TIMEX> but i'm now in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Palo Alto California</ENAMEX> which is i think the recycling capital of the world
 	
 	
 		oh that's great
 	
 	
 		so we have many recycling activities and i'm in in full uh support of all of them
 	
 	
 		oh we are too our <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX> is uh just starting to get
 		organized about it they just opened up a recycling <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> where we go and donate our our things and dump them off ourselves
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		well that's something but it it seems to me that we've gotten a whole lot better um
 		cooperation out here uh by setting it up so that we pay just a little bit extra uh actually i don't think we pay very much extra at all too but the uh garbage men
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		come by uh on your regular garbage day and pick up the recycling out at the curb
 	
 	
 		i think that's great there's a few places in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Houston</ENAMEX> where they're trying that out i don't know if it's
 		the if they've done it citywide yet or not where they have the color coded uh bags and uh
 		bins
 	
 	
 		yeah we have burlap sacks and they give us one for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aluminum</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		uh steel one for metals
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glass</ENAMEX> and then you can either bundle your <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX> or put them in grocery bags
 		so we have we leave three little piles of things out on the curb every <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> and the garbage <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> come by and
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh collect them and leave us new bags when ours get old and ratty or leave the ones if they're still in good shape
 	
 	
 		oh that's great
 	
 	
 		and the it really pays for itself because oh then the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> gets the money from the recycling
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah we're we're all for it our um we've got several bins in our on in our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garage</ENAMEX> where we uh
 		you know sort things out and and take it to to the appropriate places
 	
 	
 		yeah the one thing i wish we could recycle is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazines</ENAMEX> but they claim that because of the way they're bound
 		they uh it's too expensive to recycle them at my office we have
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> big cardboard boxes in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> where everybody goes to pick up their mail and they're uh
 		one's for white paper and one's for colored paper so anything like manuscripts or computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> or
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		things like that goes in those boxes but we get tons of catalogs and things like that and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazines</ENAMEX> and there's no way to get rid of them it just seems like such a waste
 	
 	
 		oh it does it does but i'm sure that they can uh find some sort of uh use for them if you know
 		you know there i've seen talk about uh using garbage for uh energy
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and so you know you could also apply the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazines</ENAMEX> toward that
 	
 	
 		well that would be a help i wish they would do that here we have got
 		so little landfill space left that we're going to run out before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of this decade</TIMEX> and it's really going to be
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		a mess when we have to start hunting for places to put the things
 	
 	
 		oh i know it
 	
 	
 		we did have uh another novel uh experiment start <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> now we can put all our yard clippings out you can you buy these super giant heavy duty paper bags they're <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about four feet</NUMEX> high
 	
 	
 		oh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and you get them for i think it's <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about fifty cents</NUMEX> a piece at the grocery <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX> um you usually buy them by the dozen
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and then you put all your lard yard clippings and uh leaf rakings and anything that will be compostible
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and those and the garbage <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> also pick those up on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thursdays</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh that's great
 	
 	
 		and then the uh they take them to a special part of our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dump</ENAMEX> where composting is
 		now in full swing and at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of every year</TIMEX> uh they sell all the composts to nurserymen and to local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who want to put it on their flowerbeds
 	
 	
 		right well that's a great idea i wish we were that uh involved in uh or that our <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> was so involved in that involved in recycling
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		like that because you know i've talked to many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and we wouldn't mind going its extra effort to do it
 		uh
 	
 	
 		if they make it so that it's not a horrendous inconvenience i think most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> would
 	
 	
 		yeah oh yeah you know and i don't mind you know at first it was the the little extra money that you got you know returning the cans in and stuff like that but now you know i don't mind as long as things are getting recycled you know that we don't get reimbursed
 	
 	
 		right
 		no i think it's it's to me more of a convenience to have them come pick it up
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		than to get that <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">two cents</NUMEX> when you take it to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX> we still have bins at the grocery <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> where you can turn in bottles and cans
 	
 	
 		oh i oh i know it
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		for cash but so few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> uh have enough to make that worthwhile you'd spend more in gas getting down there than you get back
 	
 	
 		right yes and then the plus the time that you waste standing in line is valuable also
 	
 	
 		now do the grocery <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Houston</ENAMEX> have recycling for their paper bags and plastic bags
 	
 	
 		we have i know of one that the one that we use uh
 		has uh recycling for the bags
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		and they're promoting the cloth bags you know the reuse reusable cloth bags
 	
 	
 		yeah well we can get <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a nickel</NUMEX> a piece for any paper bags that we bring back to be reused
 	
 	
 		oh that's great
 	
 	
 		they just take it off like they do a coupon they just subtract it from your bill
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and they have a giant bin by the front door for the plastic bags and they say you know as long as it's clean they don't want a plastic bag that's full of goop
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yes
 	
 	
 		here they don't want your rotted <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tomatoes</ENAMEX> but they want
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		any clean and dry plastic bag so i keep and the thing is i hardly have room now for all the things that we're saving it to recycle so right outside the back door i've got the two burlap bags hung up for the cans and bottles
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and there right outside the
 		that place where the garbage can is we have the bag for the newspapers
 		and now we've got the bag for the plastic bags
 	
 	
 		i understand uh my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> about once <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a weekend</TIMEX> he'll go uh to a couple of areas where he knows that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> just throw cans out
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and he'll go pick them up because he just can't stand that he he
 	
 	
 		well how nice that's great
 	
 	
 		and uh it's so you know he we have all our piles of of recyclables also
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i remember at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> the the only thing that i'm when you were talking about the composting the only thing that our city did that was they did uh provided a place for us to take <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">our Christmas</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh to for them to mulch
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		for for city use
 		and
 	
 	
 		well that's they just put all our <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> in the regular uh compost
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		pickup so they did say that you had to put it out within i think it was uh
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three weeks</TIMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh otherwise you would have to treat it like you would any other <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">lawn</ENAMEX> refuse it would have to be cut into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> foot lengths
 		so you know if we have <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branches</ENAMEX> or something they have to be cut in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> foot lengths but otherwise uh they have to be in one of their paper bags
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		well that sounds like you all really have a a great system worked out there
 	
 	
 		and they even picked up our uh
 		styrofoam plastic packing materials
 		they brought uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the week</TIMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> they left a plastic bag on everybody's front doorknob with a little note on it saying we're trying something new <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next week</TIMEX> only
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		if you have any uh of those little uh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">styrofoam peanuts</ENAMEX> that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		any of your <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> presents were packed in put them in this bag and leave it out with your recycling and we'll uh take all of those back and try to recycle them
 	
 	
 		right well see that's one
 	
 	
 		but i that's not going to be a regular feature that was just a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time thing right after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		well the but uh something need does need to be done about the styrofoam
 	
 	
 		well those things must take up a huge amount of space in landfills
 	
 	
 		that uh
 		oh yeah i mean they don't uh uh
 	
 	
 		they don't mash  they don't compress at all and they stay forever
 	
 	
 		no
 		right and i've seen where some places have taken a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plastic</ENAMEX> and uh
 		they're recycling them into other plastics
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and the styrofoam also into insulation and things like that and i think that would be great if they could get something organized
 		along those lines
 	
 	
 		yeah i do too the difficulty with that is that very few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have enough to make it worthwhile it they really have to rely on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX> that generate a lot of that stuff
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> because otherwise uh you know they're not going to go house to house collecting it and you're not going to bother if you have one bag full to drive all the way to some recycling <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> to turn in just your little plastic peanuts
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		right
 		oh i was thinking about you know like the uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">styrofoam</ENAMEX> used at uh the fast-food <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that if everybody uh and so yeah i know like our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cafeteria</ENAMEX> here uses a lot of styrofoam
 		but uh
 	
 	
 		now we quit that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about two years ago no three years ago</TIMEX> when we got <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> mugs for everybody
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		so and the only difficulty with that is that we're in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the middle of a five year</TIMEX> drought and so i it's a real difficult choice whether we want styrofoam cups to fill up our landfills or
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">uh China</ENAMEX> cups to use up our water
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but at the moment we're using the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> cups
 		and everybody gets <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the beginning of the year</TIMEX> and then uh you're supposed to keep it recycled <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		well that's good
 		that's uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		they should last a while
 	
 	
 		well let us hope that everybody's going to be paying more attention to this and that we will get uh better reuse of things because
 	
 	
 		i believe we are i i do believe everybody is starting to pay attention and take heed of what is happening
 	
 	
 		yep
 	
 	
 		and so it'll it'll be good in the long run well i enjoyed it
 	
 	
 		it sure will well good to talk to
