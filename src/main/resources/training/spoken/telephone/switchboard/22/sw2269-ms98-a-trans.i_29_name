 		of uh shall we say over <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> trips or sometimes not even over night uh anything from no provisions to uh going with what you can carry on a backpack uh maybe even a tent
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		go up to state <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shelters</ENAMEX> and little screened in areas and then travel <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trailers</ENAMEX> and all the way up to conference <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> type campings that have uh you know air conditioning like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> with uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh ski <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> and whatever else may be around some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> uh  they they still call that a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camp</ENAMEX> so i guess you could go camping and do archery and riflery and all the things that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> do at those <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camps</ENAMEX> but then go to their little hotel air conditioning <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		right
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so uh i've been through most all of that i've not done much of the no provision survival type but i've done backpacking in tents and state <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park shelters</ENAMEX> and travel <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trailers</ENAMEX> and uh camping camping with nice air conditioned rooms
 		and i guess of all the all the ones i kind of prefer the air conditioned ones and the the not so roughing ones  with more entertainment than uh survival in mind
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		uh one of the times that we were at a uh state <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> we went up into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oklahoma</ENAMEX> and went to a place called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Broken Bow</ENAMEX> and
 		rented a few canoes with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church group</ENAMEX> we were with bunch of college age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>
 		and we took these canoes into a river that would feed it that would bring us back down toward drove up upstream and then
 		worked our way back down toward the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">campsite</ENAMEX> that we were at
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and you just never can time those things right with the water the way you would like them to be uh we got there and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> was really low we we ended up carrying the canoes over portions and
 		at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> point even though i know your not supposed to do this i stood up in the canoe and reached my paddle up as high as i could and i could not even touch the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branches</ENAMEX> that were over the the
 		uh river part there and you could see debris in those <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branches</ENAMEX> where the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> had just been <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of weeks</TIMEX> prior
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		huh
 	
 	
 		so it was you know <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten or so</NUMEX> feet uh higher just <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few weeks ago</TIMEX> in fact uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few weeks</TIMEX> prior to when we got there and the
 		camp the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">campgrounds</ENAMEX> told us that uh asked where we were from and we said <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> and they said oh well we had a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> die <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">just two weeks ago</TIMEX> in that rage of water
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		well that's encouraging but they said oh you have nothing to worry about you'll have the opposite problem you may die of carrying your canoe and sure enough it uh it was a little bit laborious instead of a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a six to eight hours</TIMEX> worth of canoeing we ended up only
 		surviving about uh half the trip and it took us us about <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">ten hours</TIMEX> so we we got in our car <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> way and and went and got the rest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicles</ENAMEX> and brought them up stream and
 		loaded it all back up and went back to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">campsite</ENAMEX> exhausted but uh i have had better camping canoeing trips uh as it were uh like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guadalupe</ENAMEX> down in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Texas</ENAMEX> it's got some real nice uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		canoeing uh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> in it have you been camping much
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		i mostly do uh back packing
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> as opposed to any of the other sorts
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um
 		though i guess a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bread</ENAMEX> and breakfast or something might be a suggestion for you if you like the air condition type
 	
 	
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		uh-huh the uh yeah i've
 		done things uh i guess mostly
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">upstate Michigan the Adirondacks White Mountains um Appalachian Trail</ENAMEX> kinds of things uh i prefer going out either
 		with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> or by myself for about a week
 		and i guess i just look at it as i time i can get away from it all and
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		kind of rely on my own resources a bit although i guess i haven't gone survival camping where i scrape together all my food i've always carried it with me but uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		still it's you know nice to get away from civilization every once in a while and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		enjoy the wildlife
 	
 	
 		i wonder if uh being from uh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> area i i wonder if if it's just this area that's doesn't encourage that type of camping i i seems like back packing goes well with
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mountain</ENAMEX> and sceneries sceneries worth seeing by foot where as here your looking as you know you can go <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">two hundred miles</NUMEX> and your probably in the same kind of environment you were in when you left so
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		huh
 	
 	
 		uh unless you go over toward <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East Texas</ENAMEX> where there's a considerable considerable amount of woods or if you go
 		uh extreme south part where there's some some things worth seeing by foot uh the majority of of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">camping</ENAMEX> experiences around here seem to be geared toward entertainment where you're you're looking at the state <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX> all seem to have something of a
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		a either a lake that you'd go canoeing or skiing or whatever kind of sailing boating you want to do uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but there's not a whole lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">trails</ENAMEX> built in a lot of state <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX> there are in more of the the eastern part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> where there's woods worth worth seeing but uh that's interesting i hadn't
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that i know that do back packing usually go up to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colorado</ENAMEX> or go up somewhere and you know get away from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> to actually do that kind of uh camping
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah i end up well yeah i mean i do a lot of like even weekender kind of things i go out for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">just one or two nights</TIMEX> uh it's not my favorite thing but i can do it a lot more often so like over at the uh particularly in the uh
 		the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fall</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">spring</TIMEX> when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX> haven't come out yet uh where they're already gone uh
 		you know i spend <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">almost every weekend</TIMEX> up in the mountains and i guess i live <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about five hours</TIMEX> away from
 		some place to go hiking where i am now
 	
 	
 		that's not too bad
 	
 	
 		um
 		pardon me
 	
 	
 		that's not too bad at all
 	
 	
 		no no it's not bad and uh yeah i mean if it's if you can find somebody who's uh
 		you know willing to go out for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several days</TIMEX> you know and can handle that sort of thing uh which
 		isn't everybody you run across obviously who's willing to
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		
  
 	
 	
 		you know put seventy or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ninety</NUMEX> pounds on their back and go hiking uh  but uh it can be a lot of fun
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh i there's certainly other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who go out uh canoeing i mean there's usually lots and lots of ponds particularly
 		uh for canoeing and you know there are places you can drive in and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> and they've got the usual kinds of campgrounds and stuff but uh you can also just you know bushwack or go on semi trailed areas
 		and just get <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three days</TIMEX> from any place that's civilization
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		and that's kind of fun
 	
 	
 		yeah that would be one of my very first experiences of uh tent camping if it were with a group of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> we went up to a state <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> that was
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh the campsites were uh
 		not perfect but they were you know basic rail <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> ties and laid in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sand</ENAMEX> so it wasn't just the actual terrain and it had a somewhat level and it had a place to stick your tent and some
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you could uh drive a stake in fairly easy and and get the thing nailed down but that's usually a little windy on a lake edge
 		and uh the very first time we went up there with this group of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> we all set up these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tents</ENAMEX> most of which were borrowed and we were having to figure out you know how this particular <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> works and how this one works and it's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eleven</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">o'clock at night</TIMEX> and it's you know by the head lights of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and about uh oh a little after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midnight</TIMEX> we got all these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tents</ENAMEX> set up and i laid down inside one of them and was just about asleep when a little voice from outside the tent said uh asked if i was doing all right and i said
 		huh yeah yeah doing doing just fine you know it's a little windy but i'm doing all right and
 		and they suggested that i come out that mine was the only tent that hadn't fallen down yet and sure enough after i got out of there a little bit it blew down and the winds were just terrible and uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		then it started to rain so we didn't get too wet but uh it rained just for a little bit then went on and so after all that was over we put them all back up and
 		woke up a little <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">late the next morning</TIMEX> but uh when we finally got back from that that outing one of the uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> had asked how it went and said that he was listening to the
 		the radio and they clocked a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ninety</NUMEX> sev en <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">mile an hour</NUMEX> winds on the dam right in front of that lake and there's really nothing to stop it it's uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">forty miles</NUMEX> wide it's a huge uh
 	
 	
 		oh boy
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">lake</ENAMEX> right on the border of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oklahoma</ENAMEX> there and
 		and it had a the little little part that we were on was the peninsula with no trees so we were just stuck out in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> with uh nothing blocking us from this wind it's a wonder we didn't lose a lot more than that but uh i'm sure that was just
 	
 	
 		huh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		the top speed of the wind but it it did manage to take all our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tents</ENAMEX> out
 	
 	
 		yeah it's funny when you talk about you know this it sort of reminds me that every time i'm
 		telling somebody about like a camping trip and i've i've done quite a few say with my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> is the stuff that you remember isn't you know really so much the uh
 		the normal everyday you know oh this is a nice scene or something like this it's it's remember when are we had to put up the tent on the side of the hill and we kept sliding down to the bottom of the tent or you know when the tent's blowing down or when you wake up in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the middle of the night</TIMEX> and there's a hurricane and you know it's
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		we can laugh about it i mean your not laughing about it then too much i mean you know afterwards it's it's it's kind of a nice memory to think gee i survived that  we'll always need the uh feather bed as it were
 	
 	
 		yeah that's for sure
 		yep
 		that's true
 		on that same lake there's another portion of it that's uh
 		real uh carved out the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the the</TIMEX>
 		shoreline shoreline is
 		uh up against rock and it's it's pretty far cliff i'd say shirt or <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">forty feet</NUMEX> worth
 		and the campsites are up top and then you go down and there's a little path where the little rail <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> ties again will try to stop the erosion on the path and little stair steps all the way down to this beach
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and that was uh a that particular campout
