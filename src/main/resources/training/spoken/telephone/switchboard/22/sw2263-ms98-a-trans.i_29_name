 		i used to uh live in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ozarks</ENAMEX> and uh liked to go up there and just take a backpack and strike out into the woods
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		oh
 		you really rough it then

 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		get out of the rain
 	
 	
 		really

 		yeah
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm down here at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TI</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		most everybody i've been talking to is from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> but uh we're up here in western northwestern part of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i used to be in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX> it's some pretty <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> up there
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well you kind of know what it's like then
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		yeah but we've uh we've done uh
 		many types of camping we've we've done tent camping and
 		we had access to a motor home which is really super great  if you don't want to rough it too much
 	
 	
 		yeah you can get the
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		they have some nice camping grounds you know that have the water piped out
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		just set it up and get out of get out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> for awhile
 	
 	
 		right just get you away from the everyday things that are going on we when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> were smaller we used to go to uh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Delaware</ENAMEX> along the ocean ocean most every year
 		and that was fun we stayed mostly in state parks
 		and uh we really enjoyed that
 	
 	
 		tell you what i'm losing you
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		i said i'm losing you you're getting fade you're fading out
 	
 	
 		oh maybe my dropping my phone is that better
 	
 	
 		yeah that's
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh but
 	
 	
 		so what you try take a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">vacation every year</TIMEX> and go out and camp
 	
 	
 		yeah well we used to we don't as much anymore but uh we used to we kind of slowed down a little bit
 		but uh
 		i think the worst the worst thing is when it's raining if you get a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">rainy season</TIMEX> and you happen to be camping
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		then it can be kind of bad
 	
 	
 		i know the rain bring out the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">snakes</ENAMEX> or used to bring them out in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ozarks</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		that's kind of kind of rough when you got to fight snakes off when your sleeping
 	
 	
 		i don't think i would like that what kind
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh Copperheads</ENAMEX> mostly
 	
 	
 		oh those aren't too pleasant
 	
 	
 		no they're
 	
 	
 		yeah we have some of them around here
 		you probably have more there though i would imagine
 	
 	
 		yeah <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one year</TIMEX> they were they were just everywhere i don't know what it was we had a real rainy <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">spring</TIMEX> and then it was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all year</TIMEX> there was
 	
 	
 		oh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		just <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Copperheads</ENAMEX> everywhere
 	
 	
 		uh-huh but you still backpacked and camped out
 	
 	
 		yeah well i lived down in down in the bottom of a big hollow and we had to
 		pretty much hike out most of the time
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		if it rained we were stuck back in there had a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> wheel drive so we could
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you just get used to it
 	
 	
 		yeah i guess you know enough to look where you're walking or sitting or whatever you're doing yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah i would think i would think a cave would be could have problems like that too
 	
 	
 		yeah this cave that we used to go in was little it was small it was more
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah it was just big enough for a couple of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to  sack out
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh</ENAMEX> is your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> younger than you or
 	
 	
 		yeah he's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about a year</TIMEX> and a half younger
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		well that's great that'd be a lot of fun you have a lot good experiences from that yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah it was
 		saw a few bears
 	
 	
 		did you really
 	
 	
 		things like that
 	
 	
 		what black ones
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that would be exciting
 	
 	
 		yeah <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the first first couple</TIMEX> of times it's pretty scary but uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		after that you realize they are just as afraid of you too so
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah they're usually more afraid of you than uh you are of them usually
 	
 	
 		but
 	
 	
 		they're on the increase in this area
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i don't know if they don't have them up there do they
 	
 	
 		the black bear oh yeah yeah the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>'s been really really up they've uh
 	
 	
 		yeah oh do they
 	
 	
 		they've had longer hunting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seasons</TIMEX> than that up here even to get rid of more of them because they were uh increasing so much
 	
 	
 		yeah they down here they they stopped for awhile or they really made it hard to hunt them i don't know what it's like now i haven't been back up there in awhile
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 		but uh we we really like camping i i must say that uh

 		well it's good to get out and smell some fresh air too
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		it's just so it's a lot of work too it's uh getting you know getting ready and taking care of everything but it's um
