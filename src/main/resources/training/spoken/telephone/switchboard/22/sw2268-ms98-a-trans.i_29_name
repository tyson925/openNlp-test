 
     		
 	
 		
 
 		what kind of fishing do you enjoy
 	
 	
 		well uh normally i like to to go out fishing in a boat
 		and uh rather than like bank fishing and just like you try and catch anything that's swimming
 		because i've had such problems of trying to catch any type of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> that uh i just really enjoy doing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> type fishing
 	
 	
 		so you like fresh water
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh uh</ENAMEX>-huh i've never tried like with deep uh sea water fishing
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		because you get i get sea sick  but one of these days i'm going hoping they'll have some kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX> so i can go out and go uh deep sea fishing now that would be nice
 	
 	
 		oh i see
 		well i was raised on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas Gulf Coast</ENAMEX> in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summers</TIMEX> and during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Christmas holidays</TIMEX> we'd go down to our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> on the coast
 	
 	
 		have you
 		uh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and so i thought <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> came out of the ocean
 	
 	
 		oh my goodness
 	
 	
 		and anything that was fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> was muddy
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so i didn't learn to fish in a lake until i was well into my twenties
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		so i had i had always been a a sea fisher type which is a lot of fun
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		oh i bet it is
 	
 	
 		there's so many different ways to catch <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> you know at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> you can
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		go walking in the shallows and gig flounder and things like that which isn't technically fishing but it's a lot of fun
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so i i grew up fishing
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		what area lakes do you like
 	
 	
 		well uh now i haven't done much fishing here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> uh because i moved from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh i see
 	
 	
 		uh but uh we did a lot of fishing when we were up there but down here i have a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> that likes to go over on the east
 		in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East Texas</ENAMEX> and do fishing and i can't remember what the name of the lake is
 		and he was just here <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this past weekend</TIMEX> i could have i i think he mentioned it again but i couldn't remember what it was
 		um i want to call it <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Salt Fork</ENAMEX> or
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lake Fork i i</ENAMEX> can't remember but he said it's one of the best bass fishing places
 	
 	
 		oh oh oh uh i think i know where uh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lake Caddo</ENAMEX> or something like that
 	
 	
 		i you know that may be it that may be it and it
 	
 	
 		if it's supposed to be one of the best bass fishing places they hold tournaments there and everything
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah yeah and he said that he has never gone anywhere before and he's fished all over the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>
 		in which they can catch the biggest bass that you've ever seen
 		so i would love to go over there they were talking about going over there and some time <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this spring</TIMEX>
 		and i was thinking it would be great to go over there to go fishing and uh
 		and catch some bass
 	
 	
 		i would love to do that but they have snakes over there
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and i'm not too
 		welcome around i don't i really don't want to share a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> with a snake
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i just i i i don't see it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i just i don't i think that i perhaps would let them have the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> or something i'd make some quick arrangements
 	
 	
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		and i've heard so many stories about the snakes
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know when they pull in there's a snake instead of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> and things like that that i'm just
 	
 	
 		yeah oh
 	
 	
 		i don't know what's the largest fish you ever caught
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um gosh i think it was only like <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three and a half</NUMEX> pounds
 		and for me that's big that's why i'm saying i love to go fishing because i've never caught anything really really big
 		um so because it's always been you know in the on a lake and uh i know they have bigger <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> than that but you know <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three and a half</NUMEX> pounds and that was huge for me
 	
 	
 		on a lake yeah on a lake on a lake that's not a bad size fish
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		no that's a good size fish
 	
 	
 		i i would be impressed i mean you know
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah so uh but yeah i'd love to go catch catch like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marlins</ENAMEX> or whatever in the deep sea fishing
 	
 	
 		i've never done that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i've i've seen it
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh and</ENAMEX> and i have no problem going out in a boat uh
 		it's just so dreadfully expensive and there's just so many other ways you know when you live down there
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's not a treat
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it's what you do <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX> you know
 	
 	
 		that's right that's right
 	
 	
 		uh one of my favorite things
 		was we were forever catching crab and steaming them
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know out on the on the beach
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and you know just uh pitching them out on uh
 		on uh
 		what am i trying to say newspaper
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and and breaking them up and sitting out there and eating them and then digging a hole and pitching the whole thing in it you know and and that's it
 	
 	
 		wow
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh the the other little creatures would take care of what was left
 	
 	
 		that's right that's right
 	
 	
 		so going out on a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> never did appeal to me simply because it you know there was so much else to do
 	
 	
 		right right well do you live like along uh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Houston</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		down there

 		was it bad
 	
 	
 		oh it was horrible i well never ever go back i don't think uh and yeah and that that's true um
 	
 	
 		oh i hate to hear that
 	
 	
 		uh you know the the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> was murky and i would hate to think about catching <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> or anything there
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">huh-uh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		huh-uh no i wouldn't want to eat them you know so yeah

 		i like that place
 		
 
 	
 	
 		that then because of all the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> spills that they have had and uh it always smelled the entire time we were there it was
 	
 	
 		i didn't realize that had happened for some reason
 	
 	
 		yeah we went swimming <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time in the whole <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week</TIMEX> that we were there and the rest of the time we stayed in the pool
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		because the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> was so awful and
 	
 	
 		well of course being raised on the water i'd never swim in it
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		huh-uh swimming is for swimming
