 
     		
 	
 		do you are you on a regular regular exercise program right now
 	
 	
 		yes and i hate it  how about you
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh well i'm kind of off and on
 	
 	
 		off and on well i guess i've been kind of off and on i've um
 	
 	
 		right now i'm kind of off
 	
 	
 		had some health problems that have led me to uh stay more on than off
 	
 	
 		okay what type of exercise do you do
 	
 	
 		uh i do walking on the treadmill and then i do low impact aerobics
 	
 	
 		okay i guess you don't enjoy that very much
 	
 	
 		not  not really
 	
 	
 		you find that uh to be boring
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah and time consuming i mean it's
 		it's not just the exercise that's boring and time consuming it's uh you know afterwards you know then you have to take a shower and get cleaned up you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well i'm trying to get back in shape for softball this spring
 	
 	
 		i know you go through this this is something you go through like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every year</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		but i
 		yeah i haven't decided whether you're whether i wanna play yet or not i just bought myself a solo flex machine i don't know if you've seen those advertised on TV
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">hum-um</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it's one of those uh universal type machines exercise machine but i haven't really sat down and used it much yet so it's collecting dust right now
 	
 	
 		yeah a lot of things do that i have a negative i had an exercise bike i used to have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> and finally got rid of it because i never used it but i do use my treadmill
 	
 	
 		i used to jog somewhat
 		uh-huh well that's good yeah my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> have a treadmill it's when i go visit them uh i'll get on that thing every <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">now</TIMEX> and then
 	
 	
 		yeah it's nice because when the weather's bad you can't you don't have any excuse
 	
 	
 		um-hum no i just got the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bicycle</ENAMEX> out <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> and it was real nice outside had to get out to do something
 	
 	
 		yeah i can't ride a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bike</ENAMEX> so
 	
 	
 		i been sitting in here uh in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all weekend</TIMEX> with a cold so i thought i'd better uh better get outside and do something and not waste <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh
 		yeah it's too nice been too nice of a weekend
 	
 	
 		but uh yeah i need to start jogging again i've always found that to be uh uh really one of the best forms of exercise but it's terribly boring and so i really don't ever keep a a program up consistently
 	
 	
 		uh
 		you had any injuries from jogging
 	
 	
 		no i never have well i don't jog enough i think to develop any injuries i usually only go <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about a mile</NUMEX> or two
 	
 	
 		i guess what worries me about jogging is that i hear that it's very hard on your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> and and that you know
 		you can end up getting hurt worse
 	
 	
 		yeah it's it's tough on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">joints</ENAMEX> if you jog on concrete or on asphalt supposed to be much better if you find uh grass or or uh dirt to jog on
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah that's not quite so so easy yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		have to have the right type of uh shoes too that's very important
 	
 	
 		i found that true especially for walking on toes or fronts
 	
 	
 		but
 		yeah i don't have to buy jogging shoes all too often mine don't get very much use
 	
 	
 		well i guess mine breakdown about they say about every <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six months</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		ah i usually enjoy the exercise i do but uh like i said i'm just not very consistent about maintaining a a program
 		so i'll i'll bicycle i get into that for for a little while and maybe go out and uh on a consistent basis <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every couple a days</TIMEX> and ride a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bike</ENAMEX> for awhile but then i'll get tired of doing that and maybe start jogging again and go out <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three or four</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">nights</TIMEX> a week
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but uh that gets old too in a very short order i'm i'm hoping that this uh solo flex will uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh change things a little bit i really need to get on a regular type of program and use that thing on a consistent basis
 	
 	
 		yeah well don't let it collect dust you
 		least exercise while dusting it off
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		so maybe if i can get interested in playing softball again <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this spring</TIMEX> i can uh start some type of uh regular program
 	
 	
 		yeah that that'll be good
 	
 	
 		i've always found that that when you write things down and set goals it's a lot easier to keep uh keep something going
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh when i was in high school we had a choice of uh taking uh physical education <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX> on exercise and uh one of those involved a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six week</TIMEX> session on a universal machine
 		lifting weights and uh working out like that
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and that was very helpful and we kept charts of our progress and uh consistently uh increased the amount of resistance so you could see how much you improved over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the weeks</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i found that to be uh very helpful
 	
 	
 		so are you gonna do that
 	
 	
 		uh i need to i haven't started yet but  it's a thought
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well that sounds like something good to do then
 	
 	
 		sounds like something i should do
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		nice way to start off the spring
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		get back in shape
 	
 	
 		how often do you uh uh go out <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each week</TIMEX> on your walking
 	
 	
 		well i do i switch <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every other day one day</TIMEX> i walk and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX> i do the aerobics
 	
 	
 		okay how far about how far do you go walking
 	
 	
 		well i'm trying build up my tolerance now i just surgery um <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">less than two months ago</TIMEX> and right now i'm just a little <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">over about a mile and a half</NUMEX> but i try try to workup to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> miles
 	
 	
 		okay
 		yeah that's good well they say that walking is just as good if not better than jogging
 	
 	
 		yeah it takes it's just that it takes longer to get the same effect yeah but
 	
 	
 		it
 		sure well if you keep up a a consistent pace just to keep the heart rate going uh
 	
 	
 		my walkman broke so i'm upset now i just have to turn the stereo up real loud
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 		yeah
 		but it's a lot less stressful on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">joints</ENAMEX> than jogging is
 	
 	
 		yeah it is and it this has an you know my treadmill has an incline and you know you can get a really good workout on it
 	
 	
 		um-hum  do you go to an aerobics <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> or do you watch on TV
 	
 	
 		no i i just do it on TV i have a cassette
