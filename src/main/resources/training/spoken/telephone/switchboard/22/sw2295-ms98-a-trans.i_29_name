 
     		
 	
 		all right well on this subject i really hadn't had to deal with putting someone in there yet
 		but my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>'s always been <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">administrator</ENAMEX> of a nursing home so i've always been involved you know in one
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		how do you feel about them i mean since you've kind of been close to that
 	
 	
 		well i've
 		yes well i can kind of see both sides you know  i really can
 		um  nursing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> to me i i would personally be the last resort you know i really you know if i had to put someone in there
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		well i've had a touch of experience my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">um dad</ENAMEX> had emphysema and got to the point where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> couldn't take care of him
 	
 	
 		yeah if it's a have to thing yeah i yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh she put him in but he wasn't there very long before he died but
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um i guess um the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time that i saw him there you know as far as the surroundings that seemed okay
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but um we kind of thought that maybe they just wanted to give him some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medication</ENAMEX> to sort of you know keep him real out of it all the time and that's always kind of bothered me
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah well i kind of think that's true too i guess because it's so under staffed you know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		that's like everything else though
 	
 	
 		i have a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister-in-law</ENAMEX> who runs a nursing home but i've never actually been there and i know that she's the kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> who wouldn't allow you know a lot of the horror things to take place that you hear about
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 		yes but yeah
 	
 	
 		but still i'm sure there are you know aspects to it that aren't really desirable
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i know because i've always well my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX>'s involved in one also and i really think they really do a wonderful job
 		but still there's those little things that happens you know there really is which i think it's a wonderful place you know if it comes to that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know if you just can't take care of them any more
 	
 	
 		well sometimes you don't have any other alternative after all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> are usually well family's tied up with
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh</ENAMEX> that's it yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		their own lives and things and usually working and
 	
 	
 		other things
 		yeah yeah yeah but i think when the time comes i i hope to have the time to really look around you know and pick one that i really think my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> would be happy at
 	
 	
 		it's hard to
 		yes
 		um-hum i think that's important too in fact there's a
 	
 	
 		not just
 		i do too
 		outside's awful deceiving sometimes
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		you know
 	
 	
 		there's one uh close to where my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> is but in order to get in you have to be able to um
 		walk in on your own in other words you can't be in you know too bad a shape to start out with but then if you deteriorate um
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		they have a separate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">section</ENAMEX> for those who need care you know all the time
 	
 	
 		cares yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		but it's always well and they have a long waiting list too so there's always this feeling of well golly gee you know you've got to be able to walk in the door so you can't wait until you're too bad off
 	
 	
 		off yeah
 	
 	
 		but then you don't want to go do that when you don't have to because like uh you have to give up your <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">automobile</ENAMEX> or whatever
 	
 	
 		to oh
 		um-hum and everything you worked for so hard for all your life yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah and if you're still capable of driving and doing those things then you feel like well gee i'm you know i'm isolating myself here for no reason at the moment
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so it's kind of a that's a hard one but it is a very nice nursing home
 	
 	
 		now there is some really nice ones there's also you know some private ones you know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but of course i would never be able to afford to put my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> in  something like that you know that's way out of my reach
 	
 	
 		yeah that's the problem the expense of it all is
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and uh what i another thing i hate to see is when someone has a small amount of money and they go into one of these places and they just eat it all up immediately
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah oh yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		but those who don't have money can go in and get the same care
 	
 	
 		uh-huh the very same yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		you know
 		so i don't like that aspect
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		but i there's i think there's ways around it though that you know
 		like they could put it in one of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>'s names or something
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know but still a lot of them doesn't feel comfortable doing that you know it's their money
 	
 	
 		
 
 		this is
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		you know that's how i feel about it anyway
 	
 	
 		well yeah i've talked to my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> about that several times lately and i i said i want you to have control of your own business
 	
 	
 		yes yeah
 	
 	
 		but you know what if
 	
 	
 		yeah my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>'s seventy now so naturally she's retired but she's still on her own i mean you know
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>'s uh seventy <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>
 		and still has her own home and everything
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i think that's wonderful i really do just as long as they can and then on the other hand i've seen some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> go into the nursing home and just so happy you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that's true they have a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> around to do things with some of those places have wonderful activities and things
 	
 	
 		uh-huh they're not lonely
 	
 	
 		you know lots of stuff going on and they'll take them places and
 	
 	
 		oh yes uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so i don't know it's not all bad but i guess once you get ill then you know you really
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		have some problems if you can't get around and do things
 	
 	
 		around yeah
 		but i really don't know what the other solution would be you know i really don't
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		But no when the time comes i'm really hopefully we'll really look around before i decide on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> for my parents
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		really do because i have been raised in one you know
 		so there's lot of things i know to look for
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i don't think they'd want to go where they used to work either  you know  i really don't it really would yes
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		that might be kind of tough huh
 	
 	
 		yes and like like i said my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX>'s still in it and i really  don't think my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> want to be there  either
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		oh
 		well it's been nice talking to you and i guess we'd better get back to work huh all right bye-bye
 	
 	
 		well you too
 		okay  bye
