 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		do you have a favorite <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">basketball</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		Lakers
 	
 	
 		the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lakers LA</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yes i'm from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LA</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh how they doing this year i'm not i haven't even been following them very much
 	
 	
 		they're okay they're not um out of anything yet they're still hanging in there
 	
 	
 		i know they lost recently to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Bucks</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Milwaukee</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that's that's where i'm from  so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah that's about the i like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lakers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh Mavericks</ENAMEX> are okay but they they got a lot of problems
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mavericks</ENAMEX> do have problems without <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roy Tarpley</ENAMEX> they're not going anywhere
 	
 	
 		and see i don't think they should build up on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX> with you know with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michael Air Jordan</ENAMEX> and that's not good <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lakers</ENAMEX> got so many different players
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		they do they always seem to get the talent there
 	
 	
 		um-hum i guess that's why i like them
 	
 	
 		well they i think yeah i think <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Milwaukee</ENAMEX> got lucky because <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Magic Johnson</ENAMEX> sat out that game
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yep i'm not too much of a <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">basketball</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fan</ENAMEX> but you know i watch a lot i watch different games like
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		play-off games and stuff like that
 	
 	
 		do you think the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lakers</ENAMEX> can win the championship this year
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		not since they're <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coach</ENAMEX> is gone
 	
 	
 		you don't like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike Dunleavy</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		yeah he didn't they didn't let him have quite the the flair that uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike Riley</ENAMEX> had
 	
 	
 		huh-uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike Riley</ENAMEX> was it and that's
 	
 	
 		well <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dunleavy</ENAMEX>'s a good coach though he was
 	
 	
 		he's good it's just he's not he's not <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Riley</ENAMEX> and i think that's the biggest problem is eventually they're going to have to figure out what they need to do and catch on to each other
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well
 		he doesn't have that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hollywood</ENAMEX> attitude
 	
 	
 		huh-uh  would uh
 	
 	
 		no i'm pretty familiar with with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dunleavy</ENAMEX> because he was an assistant at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Milwaukee</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh was he
 	
 	
 		uh yeah and he uh when when they had uh injury problems with some of their major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">players</ENAMEX> uh he actually put on a uniform and went out and played
 	
 	
 		oh my goodness
 	
 	
 		they they signed him to a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten day</TIMEX> contract and uh he became a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">player</ENAMEX> even though he's assistant coach
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">huh-uh</ENAMEX>
 		that's all right then
 	
 	
 		the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> knows basketball i think he'll do all right for the Lakers
 	
 	
 		huh
 		boy you you like basketball though don't you
 	
 	
 		oh yeah oh yeah it's fun i'm watching the i'm i'm busy watching the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NC</ENAMEX> double A tournament uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past couple weeks</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIT</ENAMEX> semifinals are on <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">tonight</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah see now i watch the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the Final Four</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		once it gets down to like the Final <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Four</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah right
 		so are any of those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> of interest to you
 	
 	
 		UNLV i like them
 	
 	
 		oh yeah well  they're they're just
 	
 	
 		i guess because well that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> is from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> that's probably about the only thing yeah that's it that's the only reason why i don't know anybody else
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry Johnson</ENAMEX>
 		right well they're just <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> and shoulders above everybody else this year
 	
 	
 		are they really
 	
 	
 		oh yeah they're they're so much better than anybody else it's uh that they're prohibitive favorites in winning all their games
 	
 	
 		but then you know just like that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> said in this final in these in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCAA</ENAMEX> whatever it is the little play-off games they play so many sometimes i do think it's going to be more it's luck and ambition you know
 	
 	
 		right
 		well it's it's just unbelievable how many games they play in in college now <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arkansas</ENAMEX> played <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty four</TIMEX> games <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> that's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost half</NUMEX> of a pro season
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		see that's
 		that's too many games
 	
 	
 		it's too many for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know and and then they supposed to be studying
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know
 	
 	
 		they're talking <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">tonight</TIMEX> about this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIT</ENAMEX> game with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stanford</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Massachusetts</ENAMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stanford</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX> actually took their final exams while they were on the road playing <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">basketball</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		are you serious
 	
 	
 		they have an honor system there where they would they had uh <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three hours</TIMEX> to take their exams they sent them in by uh by fax and uh i guess by they used laptop computers to uh to get their exams finished
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		hum
 	
 	
 		send them out by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Express</ENAMEX> and fax machine
 	
 	
 		i don't think that's good
 	
 	
 		yeah it's incredible that uh that they have to do that i mean some of the the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> give you a break they give the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> a break where they can take their exams when they get back from from a tournament
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but uh these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> were actually on the road uh <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">two thousand miles</NUMEX> from from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> when they had to file their uh their final exams and send them in
 	
 	
 		yeah i don't think that's i don't think that's good
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that and then you know the laptop that's how i guess they really stuck it on a disk
 		the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> you know with no answers and they could take it like that and then just print it out in fax and it would be okay because you can put it on a you know on diskette
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and just have them take it but then who's helping them
 	
 	
 		yep
 		i don't know so do you think uh you think <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vegas</ENAMEX> is going to win the finals then
 	
 	
 		see now that's
 		yep
 	
 	
 		i think so too they plaid <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Duke</ENAMEX> and uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Duke</ENAMEX> has a lot to uh to atone for here <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> that lost to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vegas</ENAMEX> in the finals by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> points
 	
 	
 		in that the other one that upset that was an upset was <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kansas</ENAMEX> last night
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kansas</ENAMEX> is a real surprise i didn't expect them to get that far
 	
 	
 		when they
 		yeah i didn't think they was going to beat that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> i don't remember the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> but they shouldn't have beat them
 	
 	
 		uh they beat <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arkansas</ENAMEX> yeah
 	
 	
 		i didn't uh yeah that that i like i like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arkansas</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arkansas</ENAMEX> just uh they had a rough second half
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		they came out uh real hot in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first half</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Todd Davis</ENAMEX> hitting his <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> pointers
 	
 	
 		and it was like they just died or something you know
 	
 	
 		yeah uh somebody took the fire out from under them they they weren't getting their shots anymore
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">huh-uh</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kansas</ENAMEX> just crept up on them and uh uh it was unbelievable because they they did that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few years ago</TIMEX> too when they were seated a lot lower and they won the the championship
 	
 	
 		that's it
 		um-hum see now that's the that's the thing now
 	
 	
 		but i don't think they
 	
 	
 		everybody's waiting for UNLV
 	
 	
 		yeah well they they are just that much better they've got so many stars
 	
 	
 		and see if <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kansas</ENAMEX> if <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kansas</ENAMEX>
 		yeah but then you know it could be what if they're not hitting <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">that night</TIMEX> or they're low or anything and see i i feel like the college you know it's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> it's still kids
 	
 	
 		well sure i think anybody can can win on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a given</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> but they have so much talents and the average age on that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty two years old</TIMEX> they've got a lot of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fifth year</TIMEX> seniors that are playing
 	
 	
 		so
 		yeah
 		they just take them out
 		think that
 		that'd be all right
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> that are playing for long time uh they're playing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Duke</ENAMEX> uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this weekend</TIMEX> uh the average age on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Duke</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> is nineteen years old
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		Vegas the average age is over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty two</TIMEX> so they've got just so much more experience than anybody else in the tournament right now
 		but they're going to lose all those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the season</TIMEX> they're going to all turn pro i think <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stacy Augmon</ENAMEX>'s a senior and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry Johnson</ENAMEX> i don't think i think he's uh is he a senior or junior
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		who
 	
 	
 		i'm not <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry Johnson</ENAMEX> i think he's coming out this year
 	
 	
 		he's
 		yeah he's coming out in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pros</ENAMEX> this year
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anderson Hunt</ENAMEX> all their uh their best <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX> i think are graduating
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		well maybe not graduating but at least they'll be entering the the pro draft
 	
 	
 		i don't i think i think he's going to move i think he'll probably go he now <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry Johnson</ENAMEX> is definitely going to the pros
 	
 	
 		oh yeah for sure yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		there's some more that i don't i can't think of their names God my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girlfriend</ENAMEX> she she gets me because i can describe them go you know that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> you know and she'll name them for me
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Akals</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stacy Augmon</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah now they'll come out in the pros
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anderson Hunt</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		they'll come out
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		they're half they're <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> is going to be gone now and see that's another thing for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</TIMEX> with UNLV they're not going to have no team
 	
 	
 		uh well i wouldn't say that i i think
 	
 	
 		well i mean as far as the the top <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX> you know like the ones they have <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coach</ENAMEX> may not be there i think <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerry Tarkenyon</ENAMEX> may be headed for the pros
 	
 	
 		yeah he's nice
 	
 	
 		there's some talk that he may be uh coaching for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LA Clippers</ENAMEX> next year
 	
 	
 		uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clippers</ENAMEX>  that's another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> and i don't think they've ever done anything
 	
 	
 		they have a great amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">talent</ENAMEX> but they just have poor coaching i think
 	
 	
 		but um no coaching
 		yeah that's all right
 	
 	
 		they've got some great <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX> on that team
 	
 	
 		that be all right between them and
 	
 	
 		i just think that yeah
 	
 	
 		then there's that uh let's see i like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lakers Milwaukee Atlanta Hawks</ENAMEX> i like them too
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i like probably uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Houston Rockets</ENAMEX> shocked me the the i think it was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> when they uh
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last last year</TIMEX> they beat <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LA</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Houston</ENAMEX>'s playing really well lately
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last couple of weeks</TIMEX> anyway since Akeem
 	
 	
 		because i know my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX>'s in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LA</ENAMEX> see and she calls me up and tells me well <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LA</ENAMEX>'s going to come down there and beat up on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> you know and i said yeah and so when they came down  so what happened it took them a long time they beat them
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but it was like <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> out of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three seven</NUMEX> games they had to play the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> games
 		for the for the thing you know just to beat them so it was like one game over
 	
 	
 		sure
 		i think <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Houston</ENAMEX>'s playing really good ball lately
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		ever since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Akeem</ENAMEX> changed his uh <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> name to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hakeem</ENAMEX>  he added the H to the front
 	
 	
 		his attitude  i don't know i don't know them people
 	
 	
 		well uh i can understand that it's uh  i don't know why he dropped it in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> place but uh
 	
 	
 		i don't either
 		if it was his name he should have just kept it i you know that's your name that's your name
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so who do you think's going to win the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBA</ENAMEX> this year
 	
 	
 		hopefully i don't think the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lakers</ENAMEX> are going to win but i think um oh what's his
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portland Portland</ENAMEX>'s looking awfully good
 	
 	
 		no not <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portland</ENAMEX> what's that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX>  with the little guy with uh the no Isiah
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Isiah Thomas Detroit</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Detroit Pistons</ENAMEX> they're not as good as they were last year
 	
 	
 		i don't know i think they'll go i think they'll they're good but they're not great but i think they'll
 	
 	
 		they'll have to pick it up in the in the tournament then
 	
 	
 		but i think that's what usually happens to them
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX>'s playing really good ball with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Jordan</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i think they finally put things together
 	
 	
 		yeah they did good <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">last night last night</TIMEX> they had like <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred</NUMEX> and something to eighty
 		so they they was playing real good <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">last night</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah well <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicago</ENAMEX> they they've been struggling <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last couple of years</TIMEX> and they've had a good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past few years</TIMEX> ever since they had <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Jordan</ENAMEX> but they never did seem to make an impact on the play-offs
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i think this year they're going to really uh show some talent
 	
 	
 		i think also because they done took some of the pressure off of him
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		you know they because they always think it's all him and see there's not you know
 	
 	
 		it's not true they have a good supporting cast
 	
 	
 		that's not good but i mean everybody's always looking at him that's just like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry Bird</ENAMEX> and um uh God <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry Bird</ENAMEX> what <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> does he play for Celtics
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boston Celtics</ENAMEX> right
 	
 	
 		yeah see because they put a lot on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry Bird</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah i don't think the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Celtics</ENAMEX> quite have the overall talent that it takes to win the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBA</ENAMEX> this year
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">hum-um</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		they've got good individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX> but some are getting old <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Parish</ENAMEX> is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty seven years old</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		yep
 	
 	
 		he's still playing center
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry Bird</ENAMEX>'s talking about retirement here i guess in another year
 	
 	
 		well he's out i mean he's hurt this year
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so you know you never know
 	
 	
 		but they're bringing in some good young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX> too
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		which is good
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i'm i've always favored <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Milwaukee</ENAMEX> being from that area and they've made some good moves in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> but i don't see them as having the the type of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">talent</ENAMEX> that will win the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBA</ENAMEX> this year
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		they have to get by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Detroit</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX>  i think either one of them is a real tough challenge for them
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">yep</ENAMEX> if they get by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Detroit</ENAMEX> i think they can get by by uh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Atlanta</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but yeah i don't think <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Atlanta</ENAMEX> would be much as much a problem as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicago</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		well that's what i meant yeah they get by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX> hey can get by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it would it if you can beat <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago Atlanta</ENAMEX> shouldn't be that much different
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		you just slow down <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isiah Thomas</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Atlanta</ENAMEX> is um
 		they got what
