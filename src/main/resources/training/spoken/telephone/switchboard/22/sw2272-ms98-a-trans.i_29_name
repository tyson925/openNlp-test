 
     		
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		so regarding this proposal um
 		personally i guess my my initial feeling is that it it would be a great experience for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> um i i don't think that they really get that sort of experience working with the community
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> through college i i just don't think <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have that opportunity anymore
 	
 	
 		yeah probably not as much so
 	
 	
 		i think it would be a great way to keep <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> busy so that they you know they they don't get on the wrong track um you know so that they they have someplace to go after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> and they feel like they're producing um
 		i mean who knows what they may be doing in their free time if they don't participate in something like this you know
 	
 	
 		right i guess my i you know i come out am sitting on the fence but i have some concerns about uh you know if you require someone to do this for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> or two
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		that's a big chunk out of someone's life uh certainly you know there could be advantages and things to be learned
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but on the other hand you know how do you enforce it or what if they are just totally against it then does it really
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		benefit anybody you know
 	
 	
 		um-hum that's true
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		that's true i mean it might turn <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> more off than on if they're forced to do something that they don't want to do
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i guess <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> is a long time maybe <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six months</TIMEX> might be a little bit more reasonable
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but i can see a lot of benefits in that it might uh interest some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that had never thought of maybe going into social work or
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		or that sort of thing um and gosh we all know that there's a need for that
 	
 	
 		or might teach them a little more empathy towards those who you know have problems and need help with things
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		um-hum that's true
 	
 	
 		well i was thinking too um we usually think of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peace Corps</ENAMEX> as going overseas to do something but
 		if they required this where you stay in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> and you know benefit the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> here and perhaps too the fact that we have more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elderly people</ENAMEX> now
 	
 	
 		um
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh you know it could be an advantage to them
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		i think it would be nice if they could
 		you almost give it as course credit
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know um have it be just like real life teaching in a sense and maybe then uh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are feeling like they're getting something out of it too but that certainly everyone else would be getting something out of them participating and and i mean i i even think that that sort of experience is worth a lot more than reading a textbook sometimes
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		well and probably too even those who might initially be opposed once they got into it then they you know would see that hey this
 		this is giving me some benefit as well i mean they they might not express it in words so much but just sort of get in step with with uh what's going on and and really enjoy it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		right
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah when i was in college i worked um with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> and i actually ran a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Big Brother Big Sister</ENAMEX> program
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		and
 		besides just you know having this extracurricular thing i really noticed that it gave <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> a sense of commitment
 		you know they learned that they need to if they make a a if they have a responsibility especially if it's dealing with another person
 		you know someone else might be relying on them for something um you know depending on them to either be somewhere or take someone someplace or something like that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know that that you really learn to to be dependable you know you learn that when someone's relying on you you need to be there
 	
 	
 		uh-huh i think a lot of our young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> need to learn that
 	
 	
 		oh it's really it's true
 	
 	
 		oh older ones too i know a few of those
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well i i work at a in a personnel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> and um i've just found the work ethics of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to be disgusting
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i mean you know i'll someone might not show up for work and you'll call them and oh they overslept or oh they just didn't feel like going to work and so i lose my job i'll get another one
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah i don't understand that either that's that's tough
 	
 	
 		i i i know i mean i wish i was lucky enough to not want to work  you know
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but um i mean perhaps that this sort of training early in life before <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> develop bad habits might not be such a bad idea but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but you know it is it is a commitment and perhaps these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> would rather be doing something else just as constructive and we're making them do that
 	
 	
 		yeah well
 		another thing too is if you have uh some young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who are really gifted and who are leaning towards maybe the uh math and science and that sort of thing which they say we have a shortage of
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		taking them away from that which they are centered on might
 		you know be a a bad thing to take <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple years</TIMEX> out of beginning you know their life in that respect they might you know get off on some other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">track</ENAMEX> but you know it's hard to say
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 		yeah it is i don't know i think it's a very interesting
 		um discussion you know and and there's certainly uh lots of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pros</ENAMEX> and cons around it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um i i wish i had that sort of choice i mean maybe maybe it could end up being a choice
 		and things that um you know what the problem is that now it's seen as almost a punishment like when somebody um i don't know remember wasn't it <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zsa Zsa Gabor</ENAMEX> that had to do community service work for like a year
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh yeah and she didn't get around to it very much
 	
 	
 		right right or something like that and a lot of um you felonies felony <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> you know have to do this sort of community service
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i think it's getting the wrong sort of uh um connotation with it it shouldn't be looked at as a punishment
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		it shouldn't be looked at something to do to make up for other things that you did
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i i think it needs to be community service needs to have more of a positive
 		um light towards it and have it look as something
 		you know that you did because you wanted to do it because you saw the benefits out of it and not as something that you know oh you you did it instead of going to jail for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three months</TIMEX> or something like that i mean that's that's a feeling i get now and
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i i wouldn't want it i wouldn't want to be one of those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that's being taken care of somehow knowing that this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> is doing it to get out of a sentence or or you know because they were bad in some other way
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		but i guess that's not a terrible alternative if you've
 		you know you've done something that's not too terrible but they want to slap your hand a little bit  so
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		but bad enough right yeah that's true
 	
 	
 		better than ju st sitting in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">jail</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all day</TIMEX> not doing anything but but yeah i agree with your point it
 	
 	
 		yeah right yeah
 	
 	
 		it might not make the other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> feel like you were really wanting to be there yeah
 	
 	
 		really important yeah that's true
 		well this has been interesting
 	
 	
 		well i
 		yeah enjoyed talking to you all right bye-bye
 	
 	
 		you too take care bye-bye
