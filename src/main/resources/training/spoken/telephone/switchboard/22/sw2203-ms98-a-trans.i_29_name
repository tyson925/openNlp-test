 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 		no talking to my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wyoming</ENAMEX> they uh they were still hoping they get some more because if they don't they're going to have water problems <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this summer</TIMEX> so
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah that was a big problem was i was in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Dakota</ENAMEX> course we'd had plenty of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">snow</ENAMEX> but uh every once in a while they they get shorted on the snow and the water supply starts drying up
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>

 		i i hadn't been anywhere where the weather was so tremendously great for me
 	
 	
 		oh well it sounds like you need to move back there
