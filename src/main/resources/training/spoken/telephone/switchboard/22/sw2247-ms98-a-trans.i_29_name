 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		okay
 		um
 		now the term personal computer uh i don't happen to have one at home
 		um
 		but i do have a personal computer on my desk here
 	
 	
 		a type of work station
 	
 	
 		yeah uh yeah just kind of it's kind of a kluge
 		that was pieced together to to uh
 		shall we say bypass the formal
 		procurement process
 		and uh it it works just fine it says it's a monochrome monitor
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Panasonic</ENAMEX> printer
 		uh
 		no big deal it it does the things i need for it to do
 	
 	
 		is it a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two eighty six or three eighty six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base</ENAMEX> machine
 	
 	
 		no it's not even that
 	
 	
 		it's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eighty eighty eight</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh i think that's about where it is
 	
 	
 		okay uh
 		what type of uh utilizations do you make of it word processing obviously
 	
 	
 		uh yeah i do that i i do uh some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lotus</ENAMEX> on it uh do some uh Samna some uh PFM
 		uh
 		nothing extremely complex
 	
 	
 		okay uh i use them both here at work and at home
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i have <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> clones in both cases
 	
 	
 		yep
 	
 	
 		here at work i have the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">one thousand</NUMEX> which is a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three eighty six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base</ENAMEX> machine machine
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i bet that's a pretty nice setup
 	
 	
 		yes it is uh unfortunately i need all of it
 	
 	
 		yep
 	
 	
 		uh for example i was messing around with a spreadsheet <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this weekend</TIMEX> that's <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a third of a meg</NUMEX> in beta size
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		and that i know that uh brings an <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eighty eighty eight</NUMEX> machine to it's knees because
 		i had taken it over from a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> who was working on it and he had a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two eighty six</NUMEX> machine and it brought it to it's knees
 	
 	
 		yep
 		wow
 	
 	
 		just in the ability to handle
 		and then i have uh
 		a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three eighty six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">FX</ENAMEX> a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixteen</TIMEX> bit machine
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> and i'm really pleased with it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it manages to take care of all my home needs in terms of word processing and spreadsheets and uh databases database searches
 	
 	
 		sure
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh what i've gotten into more recently are the tools to use them
 		have you
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		to try to make them more effective and useful
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		have you been uh struggling along those lines
 	
 	
 		well um i seem to always be in the the next to the last generation of word processing software when everyone was in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Samna i</ENAMEX> was still in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PFM</ENAMEX> and
 		now that i finally become proficient in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Samna</ENAMEX> everybody's going to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WordPerfect</ENAMEX> so i can never quite stay current with that
 	
 	
 		well i think you will be real pleased to get away from the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">banana</ENAMEX> as i used to call it it's uh
 		i used it on uh some other machines in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> gone by and was real pleased to leave it it was a real memory hog when you started making large block changes to it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		the at least the version i had tended to keep copies of that
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		of what you were changing and deleting off in memory until all of all of a sudden you got a disc full error
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		not a fun thing to try to recover from
 		very frustrating
 	
 	
 		i can believe i can believe that
 	
 	
 		uh but again i've been dealing with large files both data and and otherwise
 		uh that was a
 		engineering spec on B2
 		you come here with the B level of specs
 	
 	
 		no not really i'm not that up on that sort of thing
 	
 	
 		well it's just a huge file that tries to describe the requirements of what you're trying to build
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		uh
 		to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> level down from assistant description
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 		okay
 		oh well it sounds like you're pretty much into computers
 	
 	
 		well i sure need them
 		uh there's no way that i could begin to process and keep up with the kinds of information or the magnitude of information that i need to to try to do my job without them
 	
 	
 		i can believe that
 		well it's it's been interesting
 	
 	
 		yes uh maybe you'll play around some and figure out how they can help you do different things
 		i think that's when you you start deciding that you really need greater assets than you already have
 		when you start seeing what all they can do for you
 	
 	
 		yeah of course needs and wants aren't necessarily the same thing
 	
 	
 		well i understand that  you know
 		if needs and wants were the same i'd have a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four eighty six</NUMEX> machine at home
 	
 	
 		oh it is is that the newest thing now the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four eighty six</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		that that must be a fairly recent release
 	
 	
 		uh that's came out around the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of the year
 	
 	
 		okay okay because i i had done capital packages for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">eighty sixes</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eighty sixes</ENAMEX> but
 		i didn't know they had a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four eighty six</NUMEX> just yet
 	
 	
 		it does a few more things uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		than
 		had been available before
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but i'm not sure that it's such a massive improvement uh you know once you get passed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty three megahertz</TIMEX> all help is kind of lost in the in the translation
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		because you no longer can think that fast anyway
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		well okay i enjoyed our discussion
 	
 	
 		i did too and you have a good day
 	
 	
 		you do the same
 	
 	
 		bye-bye
 	
 	
 		bye
