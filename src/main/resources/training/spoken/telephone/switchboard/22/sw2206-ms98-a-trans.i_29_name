 		oh i'm in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> Plano uh-huh
 	
 	
 		oh you are do you work for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> oh i see
 	
 	
 		yes i do
 	
 	
 		yeah so then we've been having just about the same weather
 	
 	
 		yeah it was pretty nice <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> but i stayed inside i came up with a cold <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">couple days ago</TIMEX> so i'm taking care of that but uh yeah it's nice and sunny out
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		have you been doing anything outside in this great weather
 	
 	
 		uh not lately  but uh yeah there was a little bit of rain <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">couple days ago</TIMEX> and they had tornados up in uh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oklahoma</ENAMEX> and i guess in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wichita Falls</ENAMEX> too
 	
 	
 		no
 		yeah i know we had a tornado watch watch <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of days ago</TIMEX> but nothing really happened
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		are you originally from uh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		no i'm from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wisconsin</ENAMEX> originally uh i don't know what the weather's been like up there but uh typically in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX> it's still uh kind uh kind of like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> uh very cold
 	
 	
 		the
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		well i lived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> for a long time so <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> weather is quite uh different for me
 	
 	
 		well we had a real mild <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> here though
 	
 	
 		yeah we did we uh they're always mild to me compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winters</TIMEX> have you have you ever been to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> in the winter
 	
 	
 		okay i can believe that uh-huh
 		no i've well <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wisconsin</ENAMEX> gets pretty bad sometimes too but uh probably not near as bad as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> uh i'm sure
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i think it depends on what part of the state
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this winter</TIMEX> here i think we only had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> instance of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one</TIMEX> weekend
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and uh other than that uh it was uh maybe just uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> real cold spells i don't have too much uh shrubbery damage from that but uh still some didn't manage to survive
 	
 	
 		yeah the only thing i don't like about uh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> weather is that it gets a little bit too hot sometimes in the summer
 	
 	
 		yeah it gets it gets uh hot but uh it's not very humid and there's always a nice uh breeze blowing
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> was really humid you know you
 		but you could you could walk around outside in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> you could just stay outside in in it you know because it was
 		i guess the average <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> temperature is about eighty uh you know in the eighties
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and it was
 		pretty pleasant except for the humidity
 	
 	
 		you know i've been here <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about thirteen years</TIMEX> and i've gotten quite quite acclimated to the weather i the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summers</TIMEX> don't bother me anymore at all i don't mind when it gets <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over a hundred</NUMEX> degrees
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		well at least you can plan you can say well uh i'm going to go to the beach <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next Wednesday</TIMEX> and you'll know that it's going to be hot enough to go
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but in in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> you really never know you can plan  to you know to go up to the beach on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fourth</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July</TIMEX> and then you know it might be <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">seventy degrees</NUMEX> or something
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i don't know what kind of a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> we're expecting this year i imagine it's going to be hot again
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i'm sure it will in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas Texas</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well that's pretty typical though uh i don't uh
 		i don't guess it's going to be any much different uh than than it has been in the past so i expect uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August</TIMEX> we'll see our  or uh share of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundred</NUMEX> degree days
 	
 	
 		right
 		have you ever been to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		no i never have
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		i've been close uh was in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Detroit</ENAMEX> one time just right across the river from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Windsor</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		uh that's supposed to be really cold weather in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the winter</TIMEX> that's why <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> gets so cold because it's so close to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah i believe that
 		i was in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wisconsin</ENAMEX> over uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Christmas holidays</TIMEX> and it was about uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twenty below zero</NUMEX> when i got up there
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		goodness
 	
 	
 		they uh they had a high of i think eighteen degrees during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the week</TIMEX> that i was there
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so it's stayed cold for the entire week
 	
 	
 		was it snowing snowing
 	
 	
 		um we got <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">snow</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> other than that it was pretty good just cold
 	
 	
 		um
 		you know uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> really doesn't seem like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> to me unless i do see the snow and the ice
 	
 	
 		we don't get too much snow here
 	
 	
 		it uh it's just really pretty with the snow and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> and all of the lights not necessarily not the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> i should keep leave the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> out of it but the snow is real pretty
 	
 	
 		well i can live without ice
 		yeah the snow is nice doesn't usually last too long here
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		i remember i know one <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> when i was in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> it snowed it snowed and and there was a white <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> but i don't
 		i guess it's been <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about five or six years ago</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah i remember maybe uh maybe <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three winters</TIMEX> where we had a white <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> here
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		other than that it's uh the snow usually doesn't last <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than a day</TIMEX> or two
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i just think it's really really pretty
 	
 	
 		we
 	
 	
 		i remember <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> here it was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">sixty degrees</NUMEX>  that was so strange to me having lived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah well that's not uncommon
 		what's really bad here in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> is when we get uh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX> and the temperature doesn't get above freezing there is no uh ice removal equipment
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> drive like the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street street</ENAMEX> is dry
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that is if if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX> are all open uh lot of them close down
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i don't think <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX>'s closed down in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of years</TIMEX> for bad weather
 	
 	
 		that's right we didn't close at all this past winter
 	
 	
 		oh
 		i look forward to one of those days
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well we usually have to make them up though so
 	
 	
 		not
 		now that's true  did you say you work in Plano
 	
 	
 		uh well i work at the main set in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX>  yeah uh-huh
 	
 	
 		oh you do i do too
 	
 	
 		i well did uh did you get much rain <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two days</TIMEX> ago
 	
 	
 		did i get what
 	
 	
 		much rain
 	
 	
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two days</TIMEX> ago
 	
 	
 		yeah <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh i know it sprinkled some
 	
 	
 		i didn't get much <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rain</ENAMEX> here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Plano</ENAMEX> but i guess it really poured in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Richardson</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		i believe it it it uh  it rained at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> or something because i saw puddles of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> outside but i didn't
 	
 	
 		yeah i don't think we got uh i don't think we got it near as bad as uh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oklahoma</ENAMEX> and i guess <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fort Worth</ENAMEX> had high high winds in fact uh the wind was responsible for knocking down a light pole at the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Water Gardens</ENAMEX> that killed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> people
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so they usually get uh worse weather  than we do
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> too
 	
 	
 		well <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX> is the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the month</TIMEX> for high winds
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and it's been rather windy here too
 	
 	
 		and we get a lot of tornados too this is the time of the year
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh</ENAMEX> have you heard the forecast for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the week</TIMEX> coming up
 	
 	
 		no i sure haven't
 		it's i think it's supposed to be nice though
 	
 	
 		yeah i haven't either yeah it's probably going to start getting summer
 		hot
 	
 	
 		seventies eighties i guess
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well that's nice
 	
 	
 		i've been checking on my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> seeing the the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">roses bud</ENAMEX> out already
 	
 	
 		oh you plant oh
 	
 	
 		yeah somewhat uh have to kind of watch watch the weather make sure everything is going the way it's supposed to
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		waiting for the waiting waiting for the weather to get nice out so i can go ahead and uh replace some of the some of the dead <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">shrubs</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		
  
 		
  
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but uh like i said i stayed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> because i picked up a cold <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the other day</TIMEX> so didn't feel like going outside and doing much
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well it probably they'll probably do okay now i have a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> that's planted some uh
 		planted a garden some things like collard <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">greens</ENAMEX> and cabbage
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh they're coming up really pretty
 		you just need a just need a good rain
 	
 	
 		yeah we we really haven't didn't get enough rain <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the other day</TIMEX> to uh do much good for uh things growing just a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">weeds</ENAMEX> right now  and they'll come up whether we get nice weather or not
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 		yeah well i live in an <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> so the only thing i grow are <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> inside and i don't do very very well with those i think the temperature in here
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		well you've got a lot more control over the inside temperature than you do than you do outside
 	
 	
 		yeah but i guess i just don't know what i'm doing
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		sometimes i i'd sit the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> outside on the patio and and i'd forget about them and it gets too hot out there and and they you know
 		burn up and so forth that's happened to quite a few of my plants
 	
 	
 		yeah i don't do well with potted <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> outside i tend to neglect neglect them and they sit in the sun too long and dry up or uh if i don't put them in the sun they don't grow
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i don't know but uh yeah i guess <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next week</TIMEX>'s supposed to be real nice outside i hope it is anyway because uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">softball season</TIMEX> starts and we're ready to to go outside and do some outdoor activities
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		well good i hope hope it's nice too
 	
 	
 		okay
 		well
 		uh
 		i haven't heard the forecast for the next for uh  coming up for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this weekend</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next week</TIMEX> so i'm not sure what to expect
 		i can only guess that it's supposed to be nice
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i hope it's as nice as it was today
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		seems like it was extra cold last night though
 	
 	
 		i'm not sure what the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">overnight</TIMEX> low was
 	
 	
 		but i know it was cold i had turn on the heat and get quilts yeah
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		guess i'll have to turn on the weather on the news tonight see what we're supposed to expect
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		anyway i guess everything's been pretty typical for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		have to see what uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX> have to offer
 	
 	
 		you know the summer really starts in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> that i remember <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one year</TIMEX> seems like it started <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about the end of February</TIMEX> yeah hot
 	
 	
 		sometimes it does uh sometimes it'll get in the eighties uh as early as uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January February</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah but it up in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> it's cold till <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about June</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		well they still have snow on the ground through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX> and probably part of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX> sometimes
 	
 	
 		um
 		yeah one thing about the snow in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX> it at at least it'll melt it melts quickly up there
 	
 	
 		well it leaves a mess then when it does melt  everything thaws out
 	
 	
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		lot of mud
