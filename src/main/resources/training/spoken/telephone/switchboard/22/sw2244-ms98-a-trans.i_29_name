 		oh well basically um because i lived in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Middle East</ENAMEX> for a while i tend to fix <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Middle Eastern</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> when i have have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> over
 	
 	
 		oh that sounds interesting

 		or another dip is made with very similar but with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">um eggplant</ENAMEX> which has been
 		actually barbecued it ends up with a barbecued taste  although we usually bake it in the oven or if we have uh those of us that have gas stoves bake it on top just by putting it in the gas <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">flame</ENAMEX> and sort of getting it
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		black on the outside but mushy on the inside
 	
 	
 		oh that's unusual i'd never heard of anything like that you know here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> it's all you know <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Tex-Mex</ENAMEX> cooking and barbecue and
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		they're really big on stuff like that and
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but barbecue is it like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steaks</ENAMEX> or is it uh turkey
 	
 	
 		yeah you barbecue <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steaks</ENAMEX> pardon me
 	
 	
 		would you barbecue a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">turkey</ENAMEX> or a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chicken</ENAMEX> or
 	
 	
 		oh yeah you can barbecue <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">turkey</ENAMEX> if you have a big enough grill but my i cook my turkeys inside you know it buy you can buy smoked turkeys
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and or uh but most the stuff that we barbecue is like steak and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chicken</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hamburgers</ENAMEX> hot dogs
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>

 		um-hum i'm sure that uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chicken</ENAMEX> that we barbecue from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Middle East</ENAMEX> has a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lemon garlic sauce</ENAMEX> i wouldn't imagine that a barbecued <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chicken</ENAMEX> would
 	
 	
 		no no this is more like hickories hickory type you know depending on the barbecue
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it's like a smokey flavor if you've ever you know had stuff like that yeah it's totally different sounds like it would be interesting to eat some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Middle Eastern</ENAMEX> cooking so
