 
     		
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		so
 		are you a freshwater or
 	
 	
 		mostly freshwater uh i yeah i i used to fish uh when i was real young down in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Galveston</ENAMEX> with my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		freshwater
 	
 	
 		i never really got into that too much because you have to get in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> really to do anything and i didn't know anybody who had a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> now so i don't fish too much in saltwater
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		most of my fishing has been in the saltwater
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		huh
 		mostly deep sea fishing for
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">grouper</ENAMEX> and bottom fish
 	
 	
 		oh neat
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		huh i have caught
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> small sharks
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		and uh yes
 	
 	
 		what'd you do with them
 	
 	
 		put them back
 	
 	
 		you didn't get a big kick out of killing them like some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> do
 	
 	
 		no no no i love <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">shark</ENAMEX> steak
 		but uh the ones i caught were never large enough to uh really do anything uh
 	
 	
 		do they have a limit on <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sharks</ENAMEX> i mean is that like a a sport <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> can you actually catch those and there's no limit
 	
 	
 		is there a limit i have no idea i know i my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> is in uh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pensacola Florida</ENAMEX> so
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it's they do a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">shark</ENAMEX> fishing in that you know in the gulf
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and um a certain period of time during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> they have
 		all along the gulf coast from i guess from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Galveston</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mayport</ENAMEX> they have uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">shark</ENAMEX> tournaments and you know there's part either as part of or separate from
 		the uh bill fishing tournaments they usually have so i have not done uh much freshwater uh fishing not
 	
 	
 		right
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		oh for you know lake lake fishing for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bass</ENAMEX> and so forth but uh maybe some what they call uh brim and those sorts of things but
 	
 	
 		right
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		nothing i think i've been trout fishing once uh
 		i've never fly fished have you fly fished
 	
 	
 		uh no i haven't i don't know that i could do that that looks awful tiring
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well i've tried it once yes uh a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> of mine
 	
 	
 		did you
 		didn't like it
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i could never get the hang of it
 	
 	
 		it looks complicated to me it's a rhythm or something
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		i usually ended snagging
 		my
 		uh fishing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> or
 	
 	
 		
 
 		catching tree bass right  did you  that would have been something
 	
 	
 		the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> along the bank
 		yes almost got an <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">owl</ENAMEX> once  but uh
 	
 	
 		so do you do you fish mainly for trophies or do you do you eat what you fish
 	
 	
 		oh no no no no i used uh when i was uh
 		working in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> i used to do a lot of surf um fishing
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		mostly for relaxation
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know there are
 		there are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who fish and then there are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who catch
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		well i'm a fisher
 	
 	
 		you just like to sit down and watch it right
 	
 	
 		that's right i i've never caught that much but uh
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		oh and occasionally we'd go out on a you know uh
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">full day</TIMEX> trip you know <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three or four</NUMEX> other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and do
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		either again bottom fishing or for grouper or i used to catch you know i've caught a few
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		worthwhile snappers red snappers and gray snappers and so forth
 	
 	
 		that's nice
 	
 	
 		what about you you a
 	
 	
 		well most of my fishing is done at um area lakes around here freshwater lakes and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um most of it i haven't been really in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a long time</TIMEX> last time i went i actually was in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Galveston</ENAMEX> trying to saltwater <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> and it just wasn't working with my freshwater tackle that was real fun  um but
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		um i went fishing at i don't know if you've ever heard of uh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lake Worth</ENAMEX> it's a fairly new lake in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh yes
 	
 	
 		and uh we went fishing there last <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Memorial Day</ENAMEX> and i caught my first bass that was actually big enough to keep i was so excited and um
 		that's really about it mostly just the lakes around here and i i <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> to take home and cook  i don't i don't get too much joy out of just sitting and watching
 		i get a little bit of relaxation from it but mainly i um i want to say i brought something home i want to say i did this i was out there for a reason
 	
 	
 		
 
 		the last time i went uh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bass</ENAMEX> fishing uh i was with my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX>
 		a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> of hers and well a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> of mine and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX>
 		we
 		i was the only one
 		who did not catch a single fish my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> caught fish his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> caught <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> he caught fish
 	
 	
 		
 
 		really
 		
 
 		
 
 		everybody but you
 	
 	
 		i did not even i did not even i have been
 		i was out on a
 		party boat <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few years ago</TIMEX> and we we were grouper fishing or you know actually we were uh snapper fishing
 		everyone on the boat
 		was catching
 		snapper
 		snappers
 		except
 	
 	
 		it had to be you you couldn't catch <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to save your life
 	
 	
 		guess who  i could i
 		that's right i would go from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> to the other and uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		the uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> boat <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">captain</ENAMEX> could not understand
 		you know he even even he started baiting my hook  and holding holding the uh the fishing rod
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		
 
 		how funny just hoping maybe he could fool them
 	
 	
 		right  and it was it was really really really bad uh i as i said i am a fisher i'm not a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">catcher</ENAMEX> but uh
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i enjoy it though i don't really get out as much as i uh as i would like too and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		they do of course you know here in um we're only just a few not <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a few minutes</TIMEX> we're you know forty <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five minutes</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">an hour</NUMEX> away from the eastern shore here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maryland</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and they do a lot of fishing there of course what i used to like to do though is uh
 		go snorkeling for scallops in some of the bays or uh
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		or oyster for oysters
 	
 	
 		that would be fun
 	
 	
 		and uh that i was able to do uh when i could go in and go down and
 		actually pick them off the bottom
 	
 	
 		right  hand picked
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		the weirdest fishing experience i ever had and uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to this day are still trying to figure out if i really caught what i think i caught we were in uh Rockport which is close to Corpus
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and we had been fishing in a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canal</ENAMEX> they had all these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canals</ENAMEX> up through this one little retirement area
 		and uh we'd been fishing in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canals</ENAMEX> and all we were catching were <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">catfish</ENAMEX> and we were pretty bored with that so we thought well maybe there are some crab in here we'll try to catch some crab
 		so i got my chicken neck and all my little net and everything
 		and something i had a rock to weight it down
 		something grabs and just runs with it and of course there's no hook so it can't be a fish i'm sure it's not a fish right
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and crab they don't bite like that they don't just run with your food so i netted it and it was the ugliest <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> i've ever seen in my life It had real teeth like human teeth
 		and it looked archaic i i had no idea what it was i called my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> long distance just to describe the thing and it had the rock in it's mouth
 		it not the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chicken</ENAMEX> but the rock itself is what it had grabbed they say it's a dogfish from everything i've described it was brown with these little white dots and it made a loud kind of almost a croaking noise like a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">croaker</ENAMEX> does
 	
 	
 		hm
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it it was the strangest thing it oh i'll never get over that to this day i don't want to get in the water anywhere around <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt water</ENAMEX> because i'm sure one of those <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> are there
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well we used to i guess the weirdest thing i've ever caught is uh in
 		some of the
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inlets</ENAMEX> and the rivers around <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rehoboth Delaware</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		they have a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> that's called an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oyster</ENAMEX> cracker i don't know if you've ever heard of it
 	
 	
 		i've never heard of that one
 	
 	
 		and it has a huge strong mouth and they actually uh use their teeth to open oysters
 	
 	
 		that's where it gets its name obviously huh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		and this is the ugliest
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		fish i have ever seen and i mean and they come in all size you know i've i've caught them from you know <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three or four</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">inches</NUMEX> long
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		up to uh i guess the largest largest one i ever caught was probably <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">ten inches</NUMEX> long but just huge ugly things just terrible
 	
 	
 		huh
 		can you eat them
 	
 	
 		no no
 	
 	
 		ooh i i don't think i'd want to even if you could if they're that ugly but
 	
 	
 		they just they just look as though you do not want to do anything with them
 	
 	
 		that's like this dogfish it was it scared me to death
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it was ugly it really it didn't look like it looked like it was something out of the dark ages that just never died
 	
 	
 		well the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time i went uh surf fishing was in
 		and i threw my line out
 		and the first thing i caught was a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sand shark</ENAMEX> which was probably a foot and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a half</NUMEX> or
 		uh <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">two feet</NUMEX> long and scared me to death i  i had never seen anything and then i was fished fished for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">another half hour or forty five minutes</TIMEX> caught a few white <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> and so forth
 	
 	
 		oh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and then i
 		felt something relatively heavy and i thought oh really here i'm really going to get one
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and i pulled
