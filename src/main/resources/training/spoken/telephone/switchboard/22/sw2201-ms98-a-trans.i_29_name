 
     		
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		lead on
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um drug testing doesn't bother me
 	
 	
 		doesn't bother you
 	
 	
 		no uh i've been drug tested twice at <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> and it doesn't bother me
 		uh
 	
 	
 		well we differ there
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it bothers me
 	
 	
 		why why does it bother you
 	
 	
 		i just feel like it's an invasion invasion of my privacy
 		you know i you know there's a lot <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> for example
 		i can go out and drink on the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekends</TIMEX> and come in hung over and do a lot worse job
 		than if i go out on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX> and
 		i don't know say take take a hit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ecstasy</ENAMEX> and dance <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">all night</TIMEX>
 		not saying that i do but i'm just
 	
 	
 		i know i understand uh
 	
 	
 		i think <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX>'s a a whole lot worse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> and it's more widely accepted
 	
 	
 		well that's true i i agree that there should be something done about <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drink alcohol</ENAMEX> because i'm sure that there's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drink</ENAMEX> and come to work especially on <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a second</TIMEX> shift or <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> shift
 		so uh i agree with you there but it just uh and it and it probably is an invasion of privacy
 	
 	
 		i i feel like it's okay if there's if there's cause somebody's performance is you know indicates indicates that they're
 		they're obviously not all there they're
 	
 	
 		do yeah okay
 	
 	
 		you know you got reason to suspect they may be doing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> and he says sure you know take them down there and test them but
 		i think a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are going to go out and
 		you know substitute something else for maybe what they would have done a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> i don't i personally don't smoke pot but a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> do and they do it in their own time at their at their at their own place
 		and they're going to find they're going to go out and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drink</ENAMEX> instead because they know that it's their job on the line
 	
 	
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		you know i've been i've come to work hung in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX> and i know i'm worthless
 	
 	
 		feel bad yeah i don't drink anymore but i can remember
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but
 	
 	
 		i can remember the you know there's nothing worse than a hangover i have to agree there nothing worse
 		than a i can remember staying in bed a whole day from a hangover  and not going to work but i that was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX> and i didn't work for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> so but you you know really and truly there's
 		there's nothing worse than a hangover and you're right and you cannot perform well
 	
 	
 		and the same is true of the drug hangover you know if you
 	
 	
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		but there's i think there's a there's a big difference between use and abuse and i do do agree that drug abuse should be punished
 		but if somebody's going to in their own home on their own time
 		in such a way that doesn't interfere interfere with their responsibilities
 		you know do it do some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> then that should be their business
 	
 	
 		course through this i think that they've helped a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> also uh
 		a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have ended up going uh to treatment you know which is offered i think at most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> places i know it is at <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> do you work for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i do
 	
 	
 		okay well you know a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have used that treatment and i <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> and that's probably been a good thing especially for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocaine abusers</ENAMEX> and stuff
 	
 	
 		i think i think that's true and i think that the key thing is the difference between use and abuse and a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> don't
 		they they don't know how to
 		use <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> for recreational purposes without
 		it becoming you know a dominant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> in their life
 	
 	
 		the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> can use you
 	
 	
 		i mean yeah it's it's you know it's easy for me to say i'm going to go out on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> and maybe
 		you know i don't have to work till <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> and if i want to go out and and drink a little <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beer</ENAMEX> or do something and just dance a lot or whatever
 		that's fine as long as i realize <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> that in order to you know i'm going to feel like crap that's just the way it is same thing if you drink but the thing is you don't get up and drink another <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beer</ENAMEX> to get over it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and and unfortunately and i think <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocaine</ENAMEX>'s a a good example it's it's just so much easier to just do some more do some more and then before you know it
 		you know you're you're always doing it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i don't know
 	
 	
 		that's true
 		that's true
 		yep
 		well
 	
 	
 		i mean i i work for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> so i don't do <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> you know
 	
 	
 		you can't i mean it and you just run the risk of
 	
 	
 		right
 		it's too big a risk yeah
 	
 	
 		of of
 		getting caught and of course the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time you get caught it's not that big a deal you have to go to treatment and that
 	
 	
 		but you're without a paycheck during that time
 		and i don't at least that's my understanding is even
 		you know the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time you go for counseling and it's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six weeks</TIMEX> before you're back to work
 	
 	
 		oh i didn't know they took you off the job
 	
 	
 		i was that i was told that uh
 		somebody had uh some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> had
 		had a cold or something and had some cough <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX> prescribed and her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> or maybe the other way around <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of them anyway had uh
 		come down with the same thing and used some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX> and was tested <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next day</TIMEX> and failed and was out of a job until he went through counseling
 		and it's like you know i can't afford that kind of loss of income you know
 	
 	
 		wow
 		who can afford that  my God i can't afford to miss a day let alone <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		i mean i've always been yeah the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time so what i'll go explain myself and and
 	
 	
 		now i would have thought if he'd have brought in the prescription <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> prescription and explained the situation that they might have let him off of that
 	
 	
 		that's what you would think but i kind of i that's i you know i heard it through the grapevine so i don't i don't know firsthand but that's what i heard was that it was just
 	
 	
 		they didn't
 		okay
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know there there were no
 	
 	
 		now see that i wouldn't agree with see see i think you got to be able to bend the rules a little bit
 		here and there too without you know if if it's a case like that because look how many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> take their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>'s or their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>'s
 		medication you know but that's a really good example
 	
 	
 		oh yeah you know you've got the same exact thing yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah and so i would think that either the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> could get him off with that or or that they should listen
 		i mean because i i just can't see that they would do some make somebody go to a rehab or whatever they go through because he took his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX> that just doesn't sound right does it
 		so it seems like they should be able to bend  the rules oops excuse me a little bit
 		on that but you but i don't know because i don't know anybody that's had to go through treatment or anything so i really don't know
 	
 	
 		well i think
 		i don't know anybody personally either
 	
 	
 		you know
 	
 	
 		i do know a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that you know do use <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> recrela recreationally and there's such a big difference
 		yeah i i don't know
 		it's it's kind of i've also been
 		you know known <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> i know one i guess i shouldn't make that a plural but uh
 		who drank on the job had <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">whiskey</ENAMEX> in his desk drawer and you tell me what's worse
 	
 	
 		ooh
 	
 	
 		you know
 	
 	
 		oh that could have been his whole career down the tubes
 	
 	
 		yeah but
 		everybody covers up you know it's the good old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> thing
 		i don't know
 	
 	
 		so does alcohol show up in these tests
 	
 	
 		i don't think so they don't test for it i mean
 	
 	
 		so so it wouldn't show up yeah well it's not that's true see there's the there it is right there it's not illegal
 	
 	
 		it's not illegal
 	
 	
 		and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> are illegal so i guess if they made <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> legal or marijuana legal then we the we wouldn't be going through this
 		you know they wouldn't be testing
 		which doesn't make any sense either because they say you know it has no place on the job and you can't work safely under the influence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> and stuff like that
 	
 	
 		well that's true
 	
 	
 		and so if it was made legal
 		that doesn't make it any safer on the job
 	
 	
 		no no i agree i think i believe in test for cause if if somebody's performance
 		and i guess that there's the other argument is that well do you wait until they screw up you know and someone gets hurt
 	
 	
 		get hurt yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah but at the same time you know you're telling me that on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">some given day</TIMEX> i'm going to walk in they're going to tell me go down and you know and go down to the health <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> and
 		you know pee in a jar or whatever it is no i haven't and so
 	
 	
 		have you had to do it yet
 		oh gosh i was one of the first ones to go i think
 		the with the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January</TIMEX> that they started it up i got called
 		so i was one of the first ones but but you did you get tested when you got hired
 	
 	
 		no see i was i've been working for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">almost eight years</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		okay so you were well i i got tested before i got hired too so
 		but
 		hum
 	
 	
 		i have to i have to honestly say that i drink more now than i did
 		because you know it's what i can get away with and if i'm going to go on the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekends</TIMEX>
 		spend my money and you know i
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		if you don't drink you know you used to drink okay you go out and you want to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> and that's
 		that's something you do when you're young and dumb i guess
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know
 	
 	
 		i'm not young anymore
 	
 	
 		i'm not as young as i used to be but i'm still
 	
 	
 		i quit
 		i quit drinking at oh a long time ago quit drinking i didn't smoke i don't smoke i gave everything up
 		so i guess i don't know what just old age i guess is why i
 	
 	
 		no i don't smoke i quit doing that and i've tried to quit drinking but it's
 		the only thing left you know i quit doing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> said quit and it was no big deal you know it's like i wasn't
 		a regular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX>
 		but uh
 	
 	
 		oh i have a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> that just are uh smoke just you know occasional joint at a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> or something
 		you know and and i'm even afraid to be around it
 	
 	
 		i i understand
 	
 	
 		because i'm afraid what if it gets you know because you can inhale it if if you're if a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> full of it
 	
 	
 		i understand
 		i was around somebody today outdoors and they're smoking and it's like you know i smell it and i'm like well is this going into my bloodstream you know is this is there going to be enough there to get me
 	
 	
 		into my bloodstream
 		yeah and with my luck there'd be the notice <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> you know  go take your test and that would scare me
 	
 	
 		get me in trouble
 		so see it didn't use to bother me when i thought that you know if i come in there and they say
 		okay you tested positive now explain yourself and i could say yeah well i was around some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that were smoking pot but i wasn't but you know it's the idea that
 	
 	
 		how can you prove it
 	
 	
 		you can't but at least you've got a chance whereas if they say for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six weeks</TIMEX> you don't have a job because you tested positive
 		that you know that's that's devastating how you know i can't live without my income for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six weeks</TIMEX> there's no way
 	
 	
 		no not many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> could i go paycheck to paycheck barely
 	
 	
 		exactly
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		so i don't know
 	
 	
 		well this has been interesting
 	
 	
 		yeah opposing viewpoints there
 	
 	
 		but
 		huh
 	
 	
 		i said opposing viewpoints
 	
 	
 		sort well sort of i mean i i agree with a lot of what you said
 	
 	
 		for the most part
