 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>

 		if they don't have good <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> fries you know if it's one of if it's a place that has other things if it's not that then we go to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> you know i order

 		well we really can't we really don't do that that often um i i guess recently we did um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i get when we got engaged <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last summer</TIMEX> um we went for fine dining because we were sort of celebrating and we went to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Annapolis</ENAMEX> area which is um

 		oh
 		
  
 	
 	
 		very trendy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> type <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> but the my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> lived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Annapolis</ENAMEX> for a short time and uh she really liked this one restaurant it was it's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">French</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>

 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		crepes yeah
 	
 	
 		and then they also have a lot of other uh <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> oriented uh meals and i normally get something that's crepe and very <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> and then she gets something <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> yeah but um yeah but
 	
 	
 		yeah  so she's the daring one in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> as far as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> goes
 	
 	
 		yeah definitely definitely yeah but most of the time when we go out um
 		we either go <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> because uh uh she just has a a need for either some type of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> chips or <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pizza</ENAMEX> or something like that or <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> fries

 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		oh really
 		
 
 	
 	
 		they'll they'll put it with just my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> loves old bay with everything so if we have French fries they have to have they have to have old bay on them
 	
 	
 		i see it's sort of like some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ketchup</ENAMEX> yeah
 	
 	
 		right yeah yeah well see i i grew up in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX> uh where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heinz</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ketchup</ENAMEX> is and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> is big <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ketchup</ENAMEX> yeah
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh really
 		oh wow well you know i have a problem because i tend to find a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX> and being on a on a tighter budget you know we don't go out to eat that much so once i find a restaurant i only want to go there
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		right
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i'll go there for you know <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two months</TIMEX> straight we won't go anyplace else
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah we do the same
 	
 	
 		and then you know i finally get <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sick</ENAMEX> of that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> and then i'll find another restaurant i love salad bar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> because um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i find that when you order a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salad</ENAMEX> at a restaurant you don't really get a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salad</ENAMEX> you get like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lettuce</ENAMEX> and you know what i mean and the croutons
 	
 	
 		no you get a couple yeah couple yeah
 		it's not a real meal
 	
 	
 		exactly but a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salad</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX> that's that's my favorite i mean if because i just feel like i can make my own <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meal</ENAMEX> and there's usually a lot of fun stuff and obviously it's a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetables</ENAMEX> but um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		um
 		
 
 		yeah we're the same because i'm in graduate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> and we're living off her salary
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah i know what that's like uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and my and my part-time work you know it's not our the restaurant our favorite <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Salisbury</ENAMEX> where actually we live you know where my where i'll return to my job or whatever we can normally eat out for um under <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fourteen</NUMEX> dollars
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		oh that's good
 	
 	
 		and that's you know that's the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of us having unlimited unlimited <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> fries
 	
 	
 		that's very good
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and uh it may be a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pizza</ENAMEX> sometimes both together um along with and see it which is really funny too you know normally she goes straight for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetables</ENAMEX> except when she's having <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> fries
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		then i i'll order like a vegetable <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">soup</ENAMEX> or something you know but she'll just have the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> fries you know
 	
 	
 		now is she does she like um <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McDonald's French fries</ENAMEX> oh okay
 	
 	
 		no no in fact in we're very environmental so we very rarely eat at any of the fast-food <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> uh just because of the um the styrofoam and the plastic waste
 	
 	
 		oh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yep
 	
 	
 		and whatever we very rarely will eat at a uh a fast-food <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX> i will i'll eat at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> more often because of graduate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> and being on the road more
 	
 	
 		well that's great
 		it just more yeah i know what you mean
 	
 	
 		but um yeah but she will she almost refuses you know to do that in fact we're at a point now where if we do a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salad</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX> at the grocery store
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		we save the same plastic container and we yeah we take it with us back to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX> and bring it home yeah and we take yeah
 	
 	
 		oh do you
 		but still uh-huh
 		well you know it's funny that you say that because um our grocery <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX> uh i personally i think the grocery <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rochester</ENAMEX> are very they'll allow you to bring your own like um <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tupperware</ENAMEX> thing like your own container
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		to fill it up i think that's great and you weigh your container you know and then you weigh your <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salad</ENAMEX> after that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		well that's a really good idea
 	
 	
 		it really is i was very happy about that because i  you know i feel the same way you do
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum yeah we we've used the same uh you know tin bottom with plastic top
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		probably for the past oh i don't know <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six months</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh that's great that really is good
 	
 	
 		yeah so so we're very you know we try to be very environmental and and in fact it's terrible now because um i guess we've donated money to a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> and you know we're in school i'm in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> and we're
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		barely surviving here and and we get calls <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">now</TIMEX> from like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Wildlife Federation</ENAMEX> like demanding a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">hundred dollars</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh jeez
 		oh man
 	
 	
 		yeah and when you say but we're in college uh we're in graduate school we can't afford that you know they they say well how about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty seven</TIMEX> well how about <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> you know yeah so
 	
 	
 		
 
 		great how to say no  and your like you'll do your own part you know you can do without necessarily spending much um-hum yeah
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah we do all we can now
 		but that it it you know i think that also goes along uh the reason why we pick the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> that we go to you know we we really have we really look at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> now there's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> other little <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> that we'll go to that is um
 	
 	
 		yep yep
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sandwiches</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chips</ENAMEX> and a pickle you know but you still and that's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> fifty
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but if you go to a fast-food <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX> you're going to spend <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">four fifty</NUMEX> and you're going to produce a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">styrofoam</ENAMEX> and a lot of plastic so we you know we'll go there instead of you know just going to a fast-food place
 	
 	
 		yep
 		a lot more waste yeah
 		um-hum that true
 		uh-huh well i i don't usually resort to fast food um if i do i feel like it's a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salad</ENAMEX> or something at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McDonald's</ENAMEX> but i do rely on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pizza</ENAMEX> a lot
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 		i do too
 	
 	
 		um i mean to me either ordering in or just going to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pizza Hut</ENAMEX> or something
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		is like gourmet  i mean i just you know what i mean it's just fun it's convenient um uh the uh i don't know if you've ever heard of Pizzaria
 	
 	
 		yeah i i agree yeah yeah
 		no uh-huh
 	
 	
 		okay well they just they'll do everything with pizzas as a matter of fact last night we just went there and they have a great <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pizza</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Spinoccoli</ENAMEX> and what it is is um normal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pizza</ENAMEX> but then with spinach and broccoli
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and it's really really good and i feel like
 	
 	
 		jeez i'll tell <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laura</ENAMEX> i'll tell <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laura</ENAMEX> about that
 	
 	
 		yeah tell her about that um and i feel like i'm getting a little bit more health out of that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pizza</ENAMEX> then maybe just well i wouldn't eat pepperoni but you know sausage or something like that but um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah that's because my that's really see because a lot of times we'll order a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pizza</ENAMEX> we'll just get a regular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cheese pizza</ENAMEX> or um uh for we just recently got married so my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so i
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 	
 	
 		got a uh a heavy duty mixer like a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KitchenAid</ENAMEX> or something like that it's called so she's make she makes dough <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pizza dough</ENAMEX> and freezes it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and then takes it out before i get <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the weekend</TIMEX> because <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pizza</ENAMEX>'s probably one of my favorite most favorite food yeah and she'll make that for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the weekend</TIMEX> and she'll make you know we'll have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pizzas mine</ENAMEX> will be regular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tomatoes</ENAMEX> and um

 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh more gourmet but more you know with yeah more with what you like and i i she loves broccoli and spinach and i think uh she i don't think she's ever probably thought of that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cashews</ENAMEX> or something like that right
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		well <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spinoccoli</ENAMEX> she can't patent the idea though because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pizza Inn</ENAMEX> already already has it but it's a it's very good well they put it they i guess they put like the dough and then the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sauce</ENAMEX> and then
