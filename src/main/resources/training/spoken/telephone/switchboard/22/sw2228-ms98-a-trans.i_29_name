 
     		
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		
 
 		all right
 		uh feelings on what caused the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> and L
 		crisis
 		i guess i don't
 		have a real technical knowledge for what happened i gather that there where large numbers of situations where
 		loan were made that appear to be
 		a good loan but in a speculative since and with have little regulation going on because of deregulation during
 		the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eight years</TIMEX>
 		uh more and more S and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">L</ENAMEX> simply began to take riskier and riskier loans
 		and then when they began to collapse <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> after the other i think almost like an avalanche of of property values devalued
 	
 	
 		um-hum kind of like a domino's effect
 	
 	
 		right i don't have a a field for whether or not
 		this is the equivalent of what was called the teapot <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dome</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">uh</ENAMEX> scandal are you familiar with that from your histories lessons or whatever
 	
 	
 		no no
 	
 	
 		uh i vaguely recall but i've never gone and done any study on it since the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S and L</ENAMEX> thing that teapot <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dome</ENAMEX> scandal is when i think during the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoover</ENAMEX> years
 		where gobs of land was was sold at really inflated prices on the theory that there were natural gas beneath it and that that appeared to be corruption within the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hoover</ENAMEX> administration i don't have a real since
 		of of like corruption that caused S and L all though i have a feeling that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> look the other way when things began to go sour
 	
 	
 		um-hum no i don't think it was really corruption that caused it
 	
 	
 		maybe
 	
 	
 		or within i think <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> just started
 		you know not not being as careful with the loans that they were making
 		whenever
 		you you know whenever they gave them out
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i think maybe they didn't check into them enough
 		or maybe because everyone else was doing they figured they would just go ahead and approve it also so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it it seems like there were on awful a lot of people
 		making loans and business decisions
 		on a
 		get rich quick is is the wrong phrase but
 		if it captures some of the the feeling i have from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> making
 		business decisions that if they failed it's sort of well no skin of my back i'll move on to this other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> or
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i i just since that they didn't have a commitment to the stability of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> they were were making the decisions for and i don't know whether that's because they had other opportunities to which they could move
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know that it was that easy for them to find new work that they didn't weren't stuck to where they were and as the things begin to collapse they just moved on
 	
 	
 		i'm not sure
 	
 	
 		or whether they had extracted enough money in a percentage base such that they didn't they didn't care any more i
 		i just i'm rather puzzled about the whole thing
 	
 	
 		um-hum i know well  i'm um i know a little bit about it but i don't as much as i should know about it i'm a finance major here at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clarion</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it
 		okay
 	
 	
 		and um i do know that one of the reasons that caused it is the fact that the federal reserved backed any loan that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Savings and L</ENAMEX> made with a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a hundred thousand dollars</NUMEX>
 		so they were kind of insured with that <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">hundred thousand dollars</NUMEX> and i think that's kind of why they they were making the riskier loans because they were like oh well we have a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">hundred thousand dollars</NUMEX> insurance on it
 	
 	
 		well they didn't they didn't have a since of risk
 	
 	
 		no i don't think so
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		and uh plus where the fact where they were allowed to make loans in any almost any type of loan and like some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX> you know they're limited to the types of loans that they're allowed to make
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i think the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S and L</ENAMEX>'s were more open with the types of loans that they were allowed to make
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		and i think if they would be more bound
 		to certain loans and not as high of insurance by the reserve then i don't think this would have happened
 	
 	
 		well do you think we there's a final accounting yet not in the since of pennies and
 		nickels but do you think there's accounting on an ordered of magnitude or that
 		that they really do understand how much money it is for awhile it seemed like every time i opened the paper up
 		it was escalating in terms of the damage uh did is your since that we now understand how bad it is
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		or is there more to be heard yet
 	
 	
 		um
 		i think that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> just basically got tired of hearing it and it wasn't making it was wasn't as good news as it was i think it's still adding you know adding up and i think it will be for awhile
 	
 	
 		so you don't think necessarily they don't have a complete grasp yet or whether  or
 	
 	
 		no i don't i don't think they do i don't think how i don't think how they could find that big how much was really lost or how much they were going to lose because there still are some S and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>'s still open
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and it's and it's very possible for them to go down in the future because of this
 	
 	
 		to be caught in the land slide
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		do you think to possibly is that it'll happen with the regular banks
 	
 	
 		i i don't know i think i think it would be harder but i think there are some regular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX> that will go down with it
 	
 	
 		it seems that i recall reading for the last
 		oh let's say starting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three years ago</TIMEX> but not so much in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last year</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX> risks
 		of relative to the loaning funds to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">third</NUMEX> world <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico Venezuela</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Argentina</ENAMEX> based on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> loans and then the price of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> had had gone south
 		resulting in those loans being very risky and i guess i read articles of various <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX> that have done
 		the right thing to contain their risks given that they had made multiple <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">billion</NUMEX> dollar loans
 		i have this vague since that that could happen
 		that that there are still monies loaned out to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">third</NUMEX> world <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> that could end up being totally lost
 	
 	
 		oh yeah um in some of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX> now i was just reading i think it was in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venezuela</ENAMEX> i can't remember what <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> it was but they just wrote off like <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">millions of dollars</NUMEX> because they know they will never get it back
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know and they just they just wrote it right off
 		i think i think we've lost a lot of money and you know like we every never going to get it back it's impossible to get it back
 	
 	
 		and so you think that it's just gone
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		um-hum yeah because we're we're you know we're talking about some peens that have just
 		like even gave up on getting it back they're even trying any more
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		they just totally wrote it off their book
 	
 	
 		do you think it is necessary to have the
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">federal guaranty</ENAMEX> program
 		like my since is that was there to try to protect small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investors</ENAMEX> but it ended up protecting big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">investors</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		which i don't think what it was meant to do
 		so i guess it i feel like as long as we have the possibility for this large numbers of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to be protected
 		the possibility exists for for these sorts of
 		of problems
 	
 	
 		um-hum um yeah i think is it necessary to have um the backing
 		um it it's it's just for you know safe purposes
 		you know in case something would happen um
 		yeah  as long as there's enough little <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> we're going to have to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">ha</NUMEX> ve something
 	
 	
 		um
 		so your since is that the
 		that uh the
 		the loan guarantees which really were accounts guaranties so the so that the account <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holders</ENAMEX> that if something went wrong they would have their money
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		right
 	
 	
 		and given that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S and L</ENAMEX>'s have had disasters then those account <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holders</ENAMEX> are are their money is still being protected
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and that is it's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">million</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">anywhere from thousands</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tens of thousands</NUMEX> i guess of
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		of dollars being protected
 		it it seems like um  there was a lot of money being protected in multiple accounts
 		uh it's if if you take
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and protect <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten thousand</NUMEX> dollars it still only a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">hundred billion billion dollars</NUMEX> and we're taking about monies way in access of that now so it's obvious that we've protected large accounts
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and perhaps multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in multiple S and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>'s
 		and and it seems like maybe that needs to be thought about rethought
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know that the for
 		i guess i'm content with the need to have protection on on accounts but i feel likes it's on an individual basis someone whose got
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		accounts in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> different S and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>'s or
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">thirty</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">forty thousand dollars</NUMEX> and they're all protected by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> seems to me like they've gotten around what was  intended to be the issue there
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		i guess i don't have a personal sense of vulnerability on it since i was not a heavy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> of any S and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>'s and and let alone any of them that went bankrupt
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and i guess that means that from my perspective it could happen again because that means i'm not worried enough
 	
 	
 		i think it could happen yeah
 	
 	
 		uh it's kind of thing where maybe we'll survive and then i then it will happen again because we don't pay attention to those kinds of things
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		i think it'll happen again but i think it'll be a long time in the future before it does happen again
 		because i think like the bank <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and any kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> like that are gonna be worried about it and not to let it happen again in the near future
 		but i think later on they're gonna start and forget about it and start making some of the riskier loans i mean you're gonna have to take some risks
 		and as long as they're backed i think they're still gonna you know start taking on riskier loans and i think there is a chance it could happen again but not until you know late you know in the future
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		well perhaps if there are regulatory
 		um
 		constraints put back in place
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it will protect that maybe we have learned a little bit of a lesson here about what happens if you remove a little of the regulation
 		uh
