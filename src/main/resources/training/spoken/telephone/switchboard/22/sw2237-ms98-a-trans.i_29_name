 		uh-huh  well you never have enough room do you think
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		no especially if your into any hobbies or anything or
 	
 	
 		yeah i have a question to ask you about gardening though you know those what are they called the they called <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">uh roly-poly bugs</ENAMEX> that's what my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> calls them anyway
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		roly-poly what
 	
 	
 		roly-poly bugs the ones that roll up in a ball
 		i don't know what they're called
 	
 	
 		is it a bug you mean
 	
 	
 		they look like they've got yeah no no it's not like a no
 	
 	
 		a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worm</ENAMEX> a cut <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worm</ENAMEX> not a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">grub worm</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you find them under bricks and all that stuff where it's moist
 		and if if you touch them they roll up in a ball
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		i don't know what they call them but i'm plagued with those things down here and i haven't figured out i even called the nursery either though see
 	
 	
 		um
 		um-hum i'm trying to think of what they are what kind they could be
 	
 	
 		i i don't know
 	
 	
 		you find them under bricks usually and that
 	
 	
 		yeah under bricks or under
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">wood</ENAMEX> or you know if you leave a piece of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX> in the yard too long they get in there they usually come out at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> but you can find them during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the daytime</TIMEX> if you pick something up that's been laying around no
 	
 	
 		they're not a slug
 		not a
 	
 	
 		a slug is actually kind of slimy and and these are just he plays with them all time he picks them up and rolls them across the patio
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah yeah

 		uh-huh i'm no help on that then because i can't think of what they are
 	
 	
 		but i'm plagued with those
 	
 	
 		what they would be
 		but i think you have a lot more <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX> down there even than than what we have
 	
 	
 		you know i think it's because probably because we're in more of a tempered zone you know we don't really we only freeze down here in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January and February</TIMEX> at the most you know
