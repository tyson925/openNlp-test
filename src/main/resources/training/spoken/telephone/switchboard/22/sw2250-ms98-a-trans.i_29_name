 
     		
 	
 		
 
 		so what kind of benefits do do you have in your job that you think is uh very important
 	
 	
 		health care
 	
 	
 		health care like dental
 	
 	
 		number one
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dental</ENAMEX> and medical yes
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yes i'm fortunate in that i was able to take early retirement from my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> last year
 		and being able to do that i was able to keep my uh health insurance that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> pays for which and i had to pick up my own life insurance
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> who works at the same <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> was able to add me to to the uh dental insurance
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		so i was really fortunate i really was
 	
 	
 		so just this so you think that the uh a good <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> will provide good health
 	
 	
 		i think they will as long as they can but the problem
 		obviously is the cost of health care as you know it's just going completely out of sight
 	
 	
 		right
 		i hear that's like one of the major uh the major costs to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporations</ENAMEX> nowadays
 	
 	
 		it is very much so it's <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a billion</NUMEX> dollar problem you know every year
 		uh our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> had it doesn't apply to me thank goodness it applies to you know to the younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> that they're having to pick up you know more of the uh health insurance cost you know themselves the deductibles are going up and the co-payments are going up
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		right
 	
 	
 		and i'm concerned that's just you know the beginning of it
 	
 	
 		see the problem i have with it is that i don't have a job
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		so i don't have  and i'm still in in school i'm still in college
 	
 	
 		that's a problem too yeah
 		um-hum right
 	
 	
 		and so i don't i don't know firsthand of these benefits
 	
 	
 		um-hum right
 	
 	
 		but i i do agree with you that health health insurance is one of the major ones i don't know about dental i mean
 	
 	
 		oh i
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dental</ENAMEX> is is kind of like uh you know you're asking for uh too much
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		to for me i think it's like uh
 		you know uh you're you're expecting too much from a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> if something happens it happens and they'll pay you for it but
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		to actually have you know big coverage for something like that
 	
 	
 		um-hum well actually excuse me our dental insurance you know it's it's good it's certainly better than nothing it's not you know it's not super you
 		for unfortunately in my case and you sound like a younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> so you probably don't have it you know i do have some dental problems and it's very very expensive
 	
 	
 		right i'm <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">only twenty one</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		and if your blessed with you know good dental
 		uh situation you are extremely lucky you really are i've had a lot of problems i still have some ongoing problems mainly because back when i was growing up
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know we didn't know about <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fluoride</ENAMEX> i was raised in a small rural <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oklahoma</ENAMEX> you only went to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dentist</ENAMEX> when your tooth actually began to hurt you know there was no such thing as preventive dentistry back then
 	
 	
 		right
 		exactly yeah
 	
 	
 		so the younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> you know uh are are really uh really better shaped than than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> or for the most part
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but uh dental insurance is important to me it is not as important as uh as health insurance you know if i had to rank them
 	
 	
 		as health
 		right so uh for a health insurance what do you think would be a uh a good health insurance with a a low deductible and a high premium or do you prefer the lower premiums with a higher deductible
 	
 	
 		oh gosh that's that's the general you know you you know you almost need to know the family situation you know and you know number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> fortunately
 		i have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and they're both grown and are covered you know under their own plans so i don't i don't have medical you know expenses for them per say
 		uh i guess if i had to choose i would be willing to pay more you know to get to get better coverage
 	
 	
 		uh-huh i guess it also depends on how many how many times you're going to use it
 	
 	
 		now we
 		that's right that's right and also we i say we uh i'm retired from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texas Instruments</ENAMEX> and they're just they're like most everybody else you can't just
 		you don't drop into a hospital and demand you know a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">thousand dollars</NUMEX> worth of tests you know or you think you need to be hospitalized but there's only a certain i mean you can go anywhere you want to go
 		but there's only approved uh health care <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> you know that uh that they will pay you know the maximum amount
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		if you choose to go you know you pick up the difference according to the emergency it doesn't make any difference you can you know you can go wherever you need to go
 	
 	
 		right so
 	
 	
 		also they were doing for a long time they were doing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> was paying for <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> opinions
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> but they have since dropped that i guess it got to be you know not cost effective
 	
 	
 		too expensive more expensive for them to do that then
 	
 	
 		right so they have dropped the uh <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> opinion type thing but before you uh allow yourself to be admitted to the hospital you really there's a telephone number that you have to call you know and they will tell you exactly you know what they will pay for it
 	
 	
 		um-hum so that that's pretty good
 	
 	
 		and if you yeah if you want to so at least you you know you wouldn't have any surprises you can order any type of you know service you want but you stand a good chance you know having to pick up at least part of the bill yourself
 	
 	
 		um-hum so the so i guess that if when i get a job and i and i look into the health insurance that they're going to pay for then i should really look really really deep into the policy
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		absolutely you need about even probably
 	
 	
 		the very first thing i i should look at huh
 	
 	
 		absolutely do you have a family
 	
 	
 		no not yet
 	
 	
 		i see well it will become even more important you know when and if you do
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but i would really check that out because i'm concerned in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">coming years</TIMEX> it's going to be you know just a horrendous burden to especially the younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		what i'm really scared about and you know i'm i don't know firsthand but i it seems to me that like you were saying <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> that the deductibles are getting bigger and bigger
 	
 	
 		um-hum right
 	
 	
 		and that's scary because you know in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end</TIMEX> you're getting insurance for basically nothing
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		i mean something really really really serious has happened for you you know to to make it worthwhile and then that that that that that defeats the purpose of insurance
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		right
 		yeah absolutely absolutely
 		um you know some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> can't can't even afford any longer you know to carry the insurance they're just dropping it you know they don't have any choice it's bankrupting them
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but i'm i am and very fortunate in that i was able to retire you know with with health benefits
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that sounds like a big big asset to do that
 	
 	
 		oh absolutely absolutely
 		same to you
 	
 	
 		well it's been nice talking to you
 		i guess i'll uh maybe see you again sometime
 	
 	
 		okay you take care of yourself good luck to you thank you bye-bye
 	
 	
 		you too bye
