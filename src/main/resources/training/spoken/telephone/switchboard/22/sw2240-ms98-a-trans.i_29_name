 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">okay Bob</ENAMEX> um our project's painting um
 		do you have any uh any thoughts on whether painting's a good idea or a bad idea
 	
 	
 		well well of course uh it depends i guess on what you're uh oh oh what you're you're interest and abilities are so far as whether you're going to paint yourself uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i've painted uh like i said both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">interior</ENAMEX> and exterior myself uh not a lot of exterior but uh i've painted you know <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> and ceilings inside and
 		you know and i usually find it uh pretty easy and and it's cheaper than hiring somebody else to do it
 	
 	
 		oh that's yeah that's for sure um what kind of paint do you like to use
 	
 	
 		it's um yeah yeah it
 		well i i nearly always use a latex base uh especially for interior uh the brands uh you know vary but uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sherwin Williams</ENAMEX> makes a pretty good paint and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jones Blair</ENAMEX> and
 		you know <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kelley</ENAMEX> i think makes pretty good paint so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		then you don't have you don't have that mess to clean up when you use an oil oil <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base</ENAMEX> painting and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> i'll tell you oh
 	
 	
 		yeah right right
 		you know um
 	
 	
 		um we uh
 		i designed and built my own home about twelve <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		and it was one of the uh you know the old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New England</ENAMEX> saltbox
 		so instead of painting because i figured when i got uh just <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple years</TIMEX> older i'm not going to want to climb up on a ladder
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so we put uh
 		white <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">cedar shingles</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and let it weather naturally
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and the trim instead of painting i stained
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so i figured instead of going out there and scraping and you know having a having to climb up on a ladder
 		the stain kind of just uh it weathers
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so i eliminated that
 		chore that i don't have to do that i stained
 		the original stain and i stained once since then because it started fading a little bit
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but other than that
 		um i'm like you i like to use a latex paint on the inside we've uh we've done some uh walls
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		the ones we haven't papered we've done in uh uh latex uh uh pastels
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and clean up is is uh is a joy uh a little <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">soap</ENAMEX> and water and air dry them and you don't have to worry about that
 	
 	
 		right yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		the what kind of what kind of equipment do you use uh i mean just brush and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">roller</ENAMEX> or
 	
 	
 		yeah a roller and uh i bought one of those that you can screw in uh uh a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> foot extension
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so you can climb up on the walls and the ceilings we didn't paint the ceilings was just natural plaster
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so i didn't want to get into doing anything there it's just uh
 		so far it's okay you know we haven't had any problems with it
 	
 	
 		yeah that's uh i i did a had to paint the uh my brick my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> is brick on the outside except for the overhangs and you know like a a little bit of uh
 		what do you call the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the eaves</TIMEX> and stuff and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah so you're lucky too you don't have to worry about going out there and scraping and painting and
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		but uh those overhangs and things do have to be painted you know every <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four or five years</TIMEX> and i bought a uh a power roller
 		that uh it's really designed for indoor use but it's got an uh you know an extension and a pump you just put your can of paint down in the in this pump and it pumps the paint up through the roller
 	
 	
 		how do you control the amount of flow or anything
 	
 	
 		and and it works pretty good
 		well it's got a uh got a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulator</ENAMEX> on it that you just set the set the deal on it you know for the the flow and then it's got a trigger on it
 		that you can release to let the pressure pump the paint up into this handle
 	
 	
 		well is there a little electric pump you put in there
 	
 	
 		yeah it's an electric just a little electric pump motor that uh
 		turns on and off you know builds up pressure so that it you know it kind of
 		pushes the paint up this uh up the extension
 	
 	
 		hum that's interesting
 	
 	
 		it's a uh Black and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Decker</ENAMEX> brand and and it works pretty good like i said it was designed for indoor use you know for painting walls and ceilings but i found it worked pretty good for outdoors uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		there's certain times of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> of course that uh that it probably wouldn't do very well because of the temperature and stuff but
 		but uh the right time of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> it works pretty good
 	
 	
 		you really have a problem down there with with
 		having to repaint with with paint <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">blistering</ENAMEX> or peeling off or
 	
 	
 		well if if you buy a good grade of paint uh you don't really uh of course <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> heat you know you it really gets pretty hot outside so you have to be sure and get a good grade of paint
 	
 	
 		oh that's there for direct yeah the direct sun beating on it yeah yeah that's right
 	
 	
 		for the direct sunlight and stuff
 		right but uh
 		but i i haven't really found it too bad we've lived in our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX> about uh oh thirteen years i suppose and and really really only painted once and you know it was new when we bought it
 		and we painted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time since then but you know it's probably going to be time to paint again
 		in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of years</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		so you're in the same position that i'm in i've i've only done mine twice and you've you've done yours twice too well once was on there and then you just had to do it once
 	
 	
 		right
 		right so and uh yeah
 		on the on the interior do you do uh do y'all have a lot of uh plaster walls that the the uh color is built into the plaster so you don't paint a lot
 	
 	
 		no no
 	
 	
 		oh
 		yeah i i watch uh some of these TV programs you know how to do it's you know you fix it
 	
 	
 		oh like <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">This Old House</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you fix it so
 		yeah <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">This Old House</ENAMEX> and some of those and i i really haven't you know haven't paid a lot of attention to to whether or not you do painting on on top of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plaster</ENAMEX> or not so
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		so i hadn't hadn't really thought about that
 	
 	
 		so they just when they when they put the plaster walls up they just tinted the plaster
 	
 	
 		well that's what my impression was that they you know that they were just white well they're white walls you know unless it's white if you want white walls then white <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plaster</ENAMEX> is uh doesn't need to be painted or that was my impression anyway i'm not sure
 	
 	
 		hum yeah that's interesting no ours you know wouldn't they were just regular plaster walls
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and then some of them you know like the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bathrooms</ENAMEX> we uh we had put paper up
 	
 	
 		right yeah
 	
 	
 		and actually the uh <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedrooms upstairs</ENAMEX> too but but the rest of it and i i just don't like papering i painting is is a lot easier
 	
 	
 		yeah that's
 		yeah
 		yeah well we really have uh our our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedrooms</ENAMEX> i guess are the ones that have uh that have to be painted uh
 		we've got paper on uh our dining <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bathrooms</ENAMEX> and then we've got paneling in our family <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> and game room
 	
 	
 		all right so you don't have a a lot of paint either
 	
 	
 		so
 		but we don't have a lot of paint inside of course the ceilings are you know all all have to be painted
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh but they don't require a lot if the only the problem that i've seen in the past is like when you've got uh if you've got natural gas and heat of course you don't
 		in the east i suppose you don't have a lot of natural gas heat but if you don't have your y our heat adjusted your gas adjusted right
 		then you can get some stains you know on the ceilings and you know ceiling ceiling
 	
 	
 		oh they get yeah yeah and that's something we don't we get uh we've got on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> fired hot water baseboard
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so and it doesn't generate uh there's a little dust on it once in a while but it's not even like hot air
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right
 	
 	
 		so and we don't use <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> in fact there wasn't any <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> in the in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> when we built there was no <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> around
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um so we didn't have that problem um
 	
 	
 		yeah so
 	
 	
 		i've got a wood stove
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i thought for a while that that may create a problem but it hasn't it's <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wood</ENAMEX> it's uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		if it's been a dry
 	
 	
 		air tight yeah so that even that doesn't doesn't create a problem but i think uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		more and more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are getting away from paint they're they're doing other things um especially with the oil base
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		yeah but the paneling and the wallpapering and the
 		and that kind of stuff are alike
 	
 	
 		yep yep
 	
 	
 		the
 	
 	
 		and there's there's less maintenance
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah it's and it's been nice to not have to worry about painting the these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> that we've got to have the paneling on them
 	
 	
 		yeah you don't have to
 	
 	
 		of course if you decide you want to change the paper and you know you've got just about as much problem as
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah that's right
 	
 	
 		so well we did do that we we stripped the paint off or the paper off of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of our you know off of our part of our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and then repapered it and it's that was not any fun
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but uh we stripped and then had somebody else come in and do the actually put the paper up
 		next time i think i'll do it the other way around let them strip and i'll hang the paper
 	
 	
 		oh i hate hanging paper that is oh that's one of the jobs that i just i'd do anything else but i'll i'll um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but papering and uh and and putting up uh drywall for the plaster i hate that stuff too you know i just contracted that stuff out and
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah that's
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i did the papering
 		you know when we built but
 		that's not my uh that's not my cup of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah it's there hanging the hanging the drywall is not uh not a lot of fun you got to you got to really pay attention and and know pretty much what your doing with that to get it up and get the the uh seams and everything
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		covered up just right and all that so it's
 	
 	
 		so what are the other questions that i'm actually i had a house um my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> before this one was uh was a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cape Ann</ENAMEX> and i wasn't up and down too that was uh that was kind of high and that was painted um
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		they are
 	
 	
 		we bought that and it was uh the paint was uh so-so i had scraped i had to do a lot of scraping
 		and then i put uh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> base paint over
 		the uh oil
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and it was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eight years</TIMEX> before i had to do it again
 	
 	
 		oh that's
 	
 	
 		and uh and the manufacturer
 		recommended that uh he gave me uh i can't remember what the solution was and he said just uh wash your <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> down with it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and then uh you know with a long brush and then just hose it all down and i had the whole yard was full of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">soap</ENAMEX> suds
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and he said just paint over that and we sold the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> oh well twelve <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i don't think they've repainted since
 	
 	
 		well now that's
 	
 	
 		so that's held up
 	
 	
 		and that's an oil <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base</ENAMEX> on the bottom and then a water base
 	
 	
 		and it was right i had uh i had put one coat of of uh
 	
 	
 		over that
 	
 	
 		water <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base</ENAMEX> and then before we sold it there was another <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> and i'd wash the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> down and all that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and it's it's held up
