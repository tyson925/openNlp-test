 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay let's see i think uh i guess since i call i'm supposed to start i think that's the way everybody has done it so far
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		but anyway i i think that um we are paying a lot in taxes but i think that
 		we have a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> and we have a lot of freedoms and we have a lot of things that uh you know the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> doing with our money
 		um we're probably one of the the only <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> in the world that has all the things that we have the you know as far as the quality of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school systems</ENAMEX>
 		um the hospital stuff that the the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> gives money to um the you know all the things that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> does like that i uh i think they need to manage it a little bit better but i don't think uh
 		anybody is just going to come in and fix it in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of weeks</TIMEX> because they've been messing it up for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many years</TIMEX> now so yeah
 	
 	
 		well i have to agree that  and and you're right i mean we you know we do have a good <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> we do have a lot of things
 		that you know show that the taxes are there to support but i do think they're mismanaged and i think that sometimes it's too easy of a
 		i don't know to easy of an answer it seems to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politician</ENAMEX> to say i'll tax them if you can't get enough money instead of trying to figure out how to cut budgets or cut spending or or you know get all of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waste</ENAMEX> out of the spending
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um i don't know what y'all are paying in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> but you know it seems like we pay the state you know there is a
 		the taxes is set by you know the the state and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> can add theirs and the county adds theirs and you know we're paying <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">almost eight percent</NUMEX> sales tax right now which seems to me nuts i came from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and you know when i left there we paid <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">six cents</NUMEX> on the dollar and that was like one of the highest in the nation
 	
 	
 		right i think it's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> here or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> point something
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah ours is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> point <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven five almost eight</NUMEX> and it drives me crazy i'm thinking you know everybody is sitting here screaming about
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		we don't want a state income tax but yet they allow the sales tax to go up and up and up and up and they don't do anything about it
 	
 	
 		um-hum  right do where are you at what state
 	
 	
 		so
 		i'm in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lubbock  Texas</ENAMEX> yeah
 	
 	
 		oh really yeah there's we're still we still one of few that don't have the uh state tax taxes
 	
 	
 		that's true and i did pay state tax in in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> but my goodness that that the what do you call it sales tax is just getting outrageous to pay
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true
 	
 	
 		know you don't sound like you're from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> where do you come do you come from originally <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> or
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i do i've lived in in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> area here since i was like <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> so uh it's i don't know rural an urban area i guess whatever i don't know what i'm
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 		you just you just managed to escape the real <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Texan</ENAMEX> accent i thought maybe you had come from somewhere else and had some experience with taxes there
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		no no i've just lived here but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i don't know i i do i can think of all the uh
 		the biblical things about it too where what did they say to uh i can't think of the scripture Render unto <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caesar</ENAMEX>'s what is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Caesar</ENAMEX>'s so
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		you know even uh
 		i think even in the the story where they had to pay the taxes the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">disciples</ENAMEX> and uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus</ENAMEX> said the money in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>'s mouth or in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX>'s inside the fish
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh i thought of those <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> things when i was i was holding for a long time yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		oh were you really trying to find someone at home well you know um back then what they try to do you know the  would always try to stump <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus</ENAMEX> try to give him something that would contradict himself
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and so that's what they were trying to do with the tax situation and of course that's when he said well you render unto <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caesar</ENAMEX>'s what is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Caesar</ENAMEX>'s you render unto God what is God's and uh
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and you know of course there i don't think they really cared about the answer they just wanted to try and catch him in something
 	
 	
 		right get in yeah
 	
 	
 		but i you know i believe in paying taxes and i mean yeah like everybody else i try to
 		you know take as many deductions as i can that right and honest you know i don't want to pay more than i have to and and i get outraged sometimes when i feel like they go up for useless reasons but i believe that they're necessary you know so i really do
 	
 	
 		oh sure
 		sure
 		right
 		um-hum right
 	
 	
 		where do do uh do you deal with taxes much in what you do when you work or
 	
 	
 		yeah are
 		no not really i i we've i spends a lot of time with our income tax though this especially <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> and last year
 		um i have been married for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">just a few years</TIMEX> so i've had to really switch around from the EZ form to the um just a regular right all the deductions and all that
 	
 	
 		schedule A well yeah and you know
 		did you notice that when they passed the new simplified tax act it seemed like it made everything harder
 	
 	
 		yeah it really did i i saw that too
 	
 	
 		i didn't notice anything simplified about it except that they took away the deductions for the interest and  other things
 	
 	
 		right right that's we're looking at buying a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and that's one of the main uh pluses we have about buying a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> is
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and it will help tremendously we bought ours <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five years ago</TIMEX> and it's the one thing it seems like you make those payments <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every month</TIMEX> and at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the year</TIMEX> you've paid all interest and no principles
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		right
 	
 	
 		so that will definitely help in taxes and what you will get back
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah you know there's a thing i just i've been trying to learn as much as i can about it
 		if if you pay i i know i get paid <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twice a month every two weeks</TIMEX> instead of twice <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a month</TIMEX> so i get <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twenty six</NUMEX> paychecks which would come out to be in like thirteen months
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		so if you pay your uh rent or your <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> payment every <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks</TIMEX> instead of once a month you'll come out paying a
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one month</TIMEX> extra <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every year</TIMEX> and it'll if have you a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty year</TIMEX> note it will take like <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> or plus <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> off of your note
 	
 	
 		that's right
 		that's right my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> uh bought a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about four or five years ago</TIMEX>
 		and they did that they thought their payment is automatically taken out like every other <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> and that's exactly right even though the note is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty years</TIMEX> she said it's going be paid off in like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty or twenty one years</TIMEX> or something like that
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		right yeah
 	
 	
 		uh just because uh exactly what you said you're making one <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more months</TIMEX> payment every year
 	
 	
 		right
 		right and that's going on the principle it doesn't pay any interest or usually usually it doesn't anyway
 	
 	
 		yeah so that's
 		that's a good way to do it and when we bought this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> we looked at doing a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fifteen year</TIMEX> note because it it added <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more</NUMEX> to the payment but not significant amounts you know it was it was a good payoff for being able to pay it off sooner
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		right that's what we're looking at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fifteen</NUMEX> or maybe <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty</TIMEX> we're not going to go longer than <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but we're taking our time we're going uh try to make our decision by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		well that's good though
 	
 	
 		so and we just started <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two or three weeks ago</TIMEX> and we're not going to just kill ourselves you know just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two or three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a week</TIMEX> at the most
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and
 	
 	
 		well that's good though is it kind of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">buyers</ENAMEX> market down there you'll be
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh yeah absolutely and the credit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">union</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">nine percent</NUMEX> interest so yeah so that's
 	
 	
 		well that's good
 		that's pretty excellent
 	
 	
 		i don't know we couldn't think of a better time to buy than now
 	
 	
 		that's good
 	
 	
 		but anyway well um i can't think of a whole lot more to say
 	
 	
 		well i can't either i appreciate the call though
 	
 	
 		yeah me too and uh yeah same here my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>  uh she went to uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> out there in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lubbock</ENAMEX> um she was there for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two or three years</TIMEX> before we got married
