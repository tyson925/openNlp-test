 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well i um i haven't really lived in a lot of big <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> i mean i'm living in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> now <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plano</ENAMEX> is outside of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> but um
 		so i don't really have a lot of experience with air pollution
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">huh-uh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but i know when i lived down in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Houston</ENAMEX> on the outskirts of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Houston</ENAMEX> there were some <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pasadena</ENAMEX> that had oil refineries
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">huh-uh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and um if you would drive by there like on your way to the beach or something
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">huh-uh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		there would just be dumping this huge amounts of
 		smoke into the air and it always smelled really bad we know that that was
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">huh-uh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		really really really bad for the atmosphere
 		what have you got up there
 	
 	
 		well i i live out in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> so that part is good uh we're maybe <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">one hundred miles</NUMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX> which has a lot of pollution from their plants
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and right now in our area were fighting against a toxic waste incinerator
 	
 	
 		oh no
 	
 	
 		and uh it won't be too far from where we live and everybody really has been you know fighting against it because we just we do not want it well we don't want one any place
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		we would like the uh industry to do more to take care of the uh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waste products</ENAMEX> before they turn to incineration because we feel that uh
 		the small percentage that they're going to be putting into the air is too much
 		you know the uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and it's just i mean
 		it's just so bad that there is just so much
 		going into the air and and the little bit you say that there putting in here and there and everywhere it all adds up
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">huh-uh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">huh-uh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and plus all the problems in
 		uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Middle East</ENAMEX> with all that smoke and
 	
 	
 		oh that has to be terrible over there
 	
 	
 		yeah so it's just um why are we doing this to ourselves  i just don't know but um i you know what really amazes me about like that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pasadena</ENAMEX> area and the oil refineries
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">huh-uh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">huh-uh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		is that there would be <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> living just really close to it i mean between the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">freeway</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">refinery</ENAMEX> you would see a neighborhood and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">huh-uh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you just thought well it's obvious that there's a lot going up in the air there and what comes up must come down
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah breathing it we're breathing it all the time
 	
 	
 		and we
 		yes and and how if they have all of those um
 		toxicity
 		i mean it there's signs around saying how dangerous it is and then here you are living  close to next to it just doesn't make too much sense
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum  um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		no and i figure we're paying to take care of this toxic waste no matter who does it So
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">huh-uh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and they have shown some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">industries</ENAMEX> have been real good at uh uh doing their part in uh reducing the amount that they have
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">huh-uh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh they've reused some of it uh it can be recycled a lot of their things
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">huh-uh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and that they've shown that it uh to begin with apparently it does cost more
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but once they get started it's really it saves them money in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end</TIMEX> and it cuts down on the end product that has to be dealt with some other way
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and if they would all that's what that's what we want done is we want industry to take you know more responsibility in taking care of it
 	
 	
 		well um individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> and things are so selfish and their desires to save <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a few dollars</NUMEX> and and that they don't care about the environmental impact that they make
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">huh-uh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">huh-uh</ENAMEX>
 		they're greedy it's money is what is it's it's the money
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yes
 	
 	
 		they're making fantastic amounts on these things and uh even the incinerator
 		the money and the income that they're going to make off this is
 		you know just astronomical
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		well have you ever visited um like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> or any place that's ever it's kind of known that it has uh pollution in it's air
 	
 	
 		we've never been we went as far as as uh like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Vegas</ENAMEX>  and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yellow Stone Park</ENAMEX> we did go we should have gone the whole way over but we didn't
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but i understand that we have an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aunt</ENAMEX> that lives out there and when she was visiting here she would look up at the stars and she said how wonderful it was to be able to look into the sky and see some of the things that she saw
 	
 	
 		well it's
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		she said they couldn't see those things out there
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		because of the smog and everything
 	
 	
 		that's so awful
 		well what about in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> i guess you've gone that way maybe
 	
 	
 		no never been in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>  i don't want to go there
 	
 	
 		yeah pretty funny
 	
 	
 		have you been there
 	
 	
 		well i've been to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> i have um <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> that direction i have it's um where are you close is it close to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Phoenixville Pennsylvania</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh
 		um no i never heard of that one
 	
 	
 		because i have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> there and
 	
 	
 		we're near <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pittsburgh Clarion University</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh huh-uh
 		it's pretty neat
 	
 	
 		it's it's kind of northwest part of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		that's beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> up that way i know it's um
 		very lush and pretty up in the back in the east it's really
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">huh-uh</ENAMEX>
 		you sound very young are you a young person
 	
 	
 		well i'm <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty one</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		thirty one you're young
 	
 	
 		seems kind of old to me
 	
 	
 		no you're young you have a lot of life yet and these we have some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who say well this isn't going to affect me this air pollution
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">huh-uh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> or
 		they think they're far enough away from something
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		that it's and they don't realize these things are going to affect everybody and if you're older it's not going to affect you that way you have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandchildren</ENAMEX> you have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> uh nieces nephews whatever friends
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		uh everybody is going to be affected by it
 	
 	
 		that's really true and we all you know need to be willing to help pay a little bit like i've heard some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> uh grumble about their uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> passing their emission tests and things and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">huh-uh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		how they've had to how it's more expensive and things and i thought well it's so much better
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">huh-uh</ENAMEX>
 		they say it has really made a difference though
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		now see we don't have that here yet
 	
 	
 		oh you don't
 	
 	
 		no we don't have that testing in that down here yet
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		but they i have read that that that it has really helped where the problem is greater where the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> is greater
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and that it has made a difference
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well i really think it must i think every i mean well think about how many <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">automobiles</ENAMEX> there are
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and each is putting out like we have a car an older <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of our <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> is an older <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> and every time you start it from the tail pipe it makes a black spot on the cement
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and you know that that is a sign
 	
 	
 		something's coming out yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah and that's all <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> are doing that and it's really polluting the air
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah if you have to put a price on it which is more valuable life or paying a little more
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">huh-uh</ENAMEX> and it's also
 		it's causing of lot of the real terrible suffering like <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> and things
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		we sure wouldn't want
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so much more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> suffering from that
 	
 	
 		yeah and like i said i think you have to pay for it no matter what you do you with it because it's industry
 		we're paying industry to make the products and we're helping pay for there making these end products that are toxic waste then we have to pay for them to pay somebody to carry it away someplace
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">huh-uh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">huh-uh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		then they put it in the dump some place and they find out well this dump doesn't work so we have to clean this up and move it someplace else We end up paying for it again
 		now we're going to end up paying for it again by having it burned in these large incinerators and we're paying to have our air polluted and our <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> streams polluted
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">huh-uh</ENAMEX>
 		pretty sad
 	
 	
 		or the where they want to put the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> area they want to put the incinerator is right in the middle of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Clarion</ENAMEX> the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> sheds that feed <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Clarion</ENAMEX> river
 	
 	
 		oh no
 	
 	
 		and you know it just boggles our mind that they can consider even putting it there because
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">huh-uh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		if that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> gets contaminated it will go on down to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX> it will you know it affects so many people
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and it's just hard to think that they could allow
 		them to do things like this
 	
 	
 		no no it's scary  it's scary
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">huh-uh</ENAMEX>
 		it really is
 	
 	
 		it's really awful well i've really enjoyed the conversation it's helped me to think more about
 		some issues that i need to be thinking more about
 	
 	
 		it is really a concern
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">huh-uh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		its a
 	
 	
 		and it's instead of waiting until it directly affects me like you say it's important to be involved ahead of time well you have a good day
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">huh-uh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		well you too
 	
 	
 		thank you
 	
 	
 		huh-uh  bye
 	
 	
 		bye-bye
