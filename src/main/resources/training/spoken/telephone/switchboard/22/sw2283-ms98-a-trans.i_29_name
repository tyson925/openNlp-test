 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so i guess a good question to ask is do you do your own work or do you do you like to do it
 	
 	
 		yeah well i um
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about a or just over a year ago</TIMEX> i bought my
 		my own <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> so this has been the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> opportunity i've had to uh be working on my own lawn and garden and uh you know
 		back when i was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX> you know <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mom</ENAMEX> would send me out to weed the garden i i'd hate it you know now i sort of take pride in uh in the yard and you know how the how the place looks and uh so i don't mind doing it so much anymore
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah so do you have a do you have a garden or do you just do your landscaping now and your lawn
 	
 	
 		well it's yeah it's it's primarily just uh like landscaping a little bit you know i've got some uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">bushes</ENAMEX> around the foundation you know the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">foundation</ENAMEX> planting things like that and then there's some uh
 		uh just some little flowerbeds and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mom</ENAMEX> grows she's an avid <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gardener</ENAMEX> and she starts her own stuff from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seed</ENAMEX> now and uh
 		she gets a little over zealous when she is planting these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seeds</ENAMEX> in the winter time and and starting them uh
 		she ends up with so many <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> that she can't fit them all in her garden they have a huge yard and a huge <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and so she brings them up here from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philadelphia</ENAMEX> and gives me all her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">extras</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		well that's pretty good my my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> is very over zealous too she's got
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		some really nice flowerbeds she puts a lot of time into them this is my <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">first year</TIMEX> in a in a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> where i
 		thinking about doing some flowerbeds and stuff
 		oh we i've always had crude ones at my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>'s but this is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time that i really have to landscape a house his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> is more like a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">farmhouse</ENAMEX> its not on a main road
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> is on a main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> and it has nothing  i mean nothing  but uh what i do do is now i've always done it at my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>'s house
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		we have my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> and i have a couple of gardens i think we figured out total
 		um
 		this is for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetables</ENAMEX> about <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two thirds</NUMEX> of an acre so we each have a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> of an acre we do
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		geez that's a that's more than

 		yeah well it's my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX>'s and we've had it for over he's been there for a long time so
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		um it just happens they built a shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> next to it  but um they put up a nice <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">fence</ENAMEX> so we still have a lot of privacy
 	
 	
 		oh geez
 	
 	
 		and we grow a lot of food
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>

 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and we've tilled them so much but they're still
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		we we my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> uses plenty of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fertilizer</ENAMEX> i don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing
 		boy i wish this phone would stop screeching
 	
 	
 		are you getting a lot of static on your end of the line
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		i'm trying i don't know if it's my phone
 		this is bad it's not getting any better
 	
 	
 		yeah i can't even hear what you're
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		geez it's gone
 	
 	
 		i don't see i don't think my phone really does that
 		but every time i have this phone is a little weird i mean it's been dropped on the floor <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred</NUMEX> times
 	
 	
 		well i i don't know there was well whatever it was there was a second there i couldn't even hear what you were saying but um
 	
 	
 		yeah i was beating on the phone going can you hear me so
 	
 	
 		yeah i guess i was having a hard time there too i thought it sounded well
 		guess we better stick to the subject for the benefit of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> uh uh doing this work but um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah i mean that's a uh heck of a plot you must have uh a lot of different stuff you get out of it especially up in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vermont</ENAMEX> there you should have uh some really nice soil
 	
 	
 		yeah we we grow a lot of um the basic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">corn</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">corn potatoes</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		she likes to really get into her pumpkins and see how many she can grow basic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">corn potatoes</ENAMEX> and uh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">acorn</ENAMEX> squash are good <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> keepers
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i mean things the way we grow are carrots and uh cabbage that sort of more less goes to waste you know we eat it we just too much she she starts her own <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> she plants a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tomatoes</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i let her do a lot of the planting and putting and i i do a lot of the uh
 		a lot of the the back the back work and stuff but she does she helps me a lot too she puts a lot of financial she plans it all out
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		beans like to be near certain types of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> now they they find that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tomatoes</ENAMEX> don't do well if you put them next to something like uh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peas</ENAMEX> i don't know something
 	
 	
 		oh really is because of like the cross pollination or
 	
 	
 		no it's just like something like an onion and a tomato would go together but you're not supposed to put your onions near your <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beans</ENAMEX> i guess it's
 		it it's just what scents it gives off they just don't like each other
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		i mean  she she reads all kinds of books so i wish i knew more to tell you why but
 	
 	
 		what
 		huh my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mom</ENAMEX> uh
 		put uh cantaloupes and cucumbers
 		near each other once and they got cross pollinated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		they
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and we ended up with these these like
 		things on the cantaloupe vines that i mean were looked like round big huge round cucumbers
 	
 	
 		oh that's really weird
 	
 	
 		and
 		and yeah i mean there these were like some mutant
 	
 	
 		i will put i've put my uh
 		cucumbers are down at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> end of the garden and like
 		like i'll make an L shape i've put cantaloupe so they've been pretty close together
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		but i don't think the vines they don't really they don't have to be touching or anything like you say they cross pollinate just by <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		no it's just the like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX> will do it
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		um either that or my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mom</ENAMEX> just had some bad <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seed</ENAMEX> or something
 	
 	
 		i know
 		some something weird
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> we didn't this <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last season</TIMEX> it was it was too wet up here
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		we lost a lot of oh uh root things our oh uh our squash and our <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">potatoes</ENAMEX> and we got half our yield it was really bad because of the water
 	
 	
 		oh well
 		yeah when i uh
 		my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> used to live in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Littleton Massachusetts</ENAMEX> and when we moved in there we had a uh really wet
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">backyard</ENAMEX> and uh my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mom</ENAMEX> wanted a vegetable garden so we trucked in uh
 		i think it was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">seven</NUMEX>
 		what was it <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">cubic seven yards cubic yards</NUMEX> i think that's how they measure dirt but
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">seven yards</NUMEX> of sand i got to shovel it all
 	
 	
 		yeah i i have to do that i want to make some flowerbeds and i'm going to have a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">yard</ENAMEX> truck come in
 	
 	
 		lots of fun
 	
 	
 		with some topsoil
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i'm going to a my problem is i want to use those railroad ties to build up a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planter</ENAMEX> but i don't know if the creosote in the railroad ties is going to do something
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		to uh you know if i want to grow a tomato or something in there  i i mean i guess it'd go for my <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> but
 	
 	
 		right
 		well it seems
 		i've seen a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> use them you know for flowerbeds but i don't know what whether they'd have creosote would
 		do anything i mean
 	
 	
 		yeah i don't i don't i just don't think you i always thought i'd put a tomato <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> in there or something weird but i don't think i could really eat the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX> off it without wondering
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i don't know if they make landscape ties that aren't treated
 	
 	
 		well you can get um you can get pressurized lumber
 	
 	
 		yeah but they put some kind of
 	
 	
 		oh that's right there's even there's bad <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemicals</ENAMEX> in those too
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemicals</ENAMEX> in there too
 		yeah well i'm not really worried about it it's mainly for flower bed so i'm not going to not going i'm just not going to put that tomato <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> in there
 	
 	
 		alright
 	
 	
 		but i yeah i do want to have a raised bed i've never i my flower gardens have always been like on the ground
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		they don't
 		it just looks so much better when it's up against the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> tiered up
 	
 	
 		well not that you can see it a little better and it stands out
 	
 	
 		yeah this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> that i have is just a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedroom ranch</ENAMEX> and i can tell you there's nothing around it cement <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">foundation</ENAMEX> all the way round it not a shrub not a bush
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		there was a lilac <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">landlord</ENAMEX> cut it down and
 		said yep that's one thing you have to do <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> keep that lilac <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bush</ENAMEX> cut down so it doesn't rub up against the siding and i'm looking at him like jeez <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> would kill to have a lilac bush
 	
 	
 		oh geez
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and he's cutting it down  so that's all right flower beds are all right anything as long as it doesn't rub up against the siding
 	
 	
 		rub up against the siding uh
 	
 	
 		yep that's what he's worried about the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> or a bush because lilac <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">bushes</ENAMEX> they they grow fast
 		some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> uh would really like to have them and then the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that do have them they spread and they sprout all over their their lawn
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so they're kind of a pain but you know <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who don't have them think they're great and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who do have them
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">curse curse</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		another thing i have that um is weird is these a locus <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> in the backyard as a matter of fact there's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of them very badly trimmed they aren't trimmed at all
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i can imagine if i had to mow the lawn in the back which we said we'd do
 		if the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> hang down so low and the locus <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> have like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three quarters</TIMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">an inch</NUMEX> thorns on it so
 	
 	
 		yeah because it like i i think i've seen those before but i don't remember what they look like
 	
 	
 		they're a pretty tree but you just when you walk up to them they're covered with thorns so we're going to get a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> saw and we're going to limb limb it extensively so it the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> up overhead
 	
 	
 		so it'll give you room to get under it sure
 	
 	
 		yeah  because i can just see brushing up against it that it would rip your skin it's worse than a rose a rose bush
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		hm
 	
 	
 		many times worse because of course it's a tree
 	
 	
 		oh a chainsaw is always something very nice to have
 	
 	
 		yep my uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> used to work on them so i don't think i'll have a problem my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> will have problem borrowing one
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		even
 	
 	
 		then you got to get him to if he's going to do it you've got to twist his arm to get him to go do it
 	
 	
 		well if that's not the problem it
