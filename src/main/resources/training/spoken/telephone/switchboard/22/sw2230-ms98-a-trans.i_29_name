 
     		
 	
 		why do you think so few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> vote then
 	
 	
 		why do i think so few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> vote i
 		i think a lot of it is uh apathy um um
 		for example uh when things are going good i think the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voter</ENAMEX> turnout is less just because people
 		figure why bother you know what's the difference especially when <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> seem roughly equal
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">um</ENAMEX> and in others cases you know they they see themselves as one <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voter</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a million</NUMEX> and they think what difference is it going to make whether i vote or not they they feel like <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> vote doesn't have an impact
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i think a lot of cases like a lot of our
 		minority issues the we had the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten four one</NUMEX> verses the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fourteen one</NUMEX> election here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> a while back
 		and it lost well that was decided by a very small margin
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">um</ENAMEX> and there were a lot of of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minorities</ENAMEX> that wanted it to go
 		the way that it didn't go
 		but they also had very low voter turnouts especially like in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanic</ENAMEX> community
 		and i think in that case they've just they developed a distrust of the system
 		and so they've chosen not to participate in it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i think that's part of it
 	
 	
 		what part what part would you say the big <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> aspect plays the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that don't want to be called for
 	
 	
 		what do you think
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jury</ENAMEX> duty or or things that they've heard that says you know well they use this registration for this purpose or that so they just don't bother
 	
 	
 		oh
 		i've i've heard <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> say that i know it's it's a real thing and i think it makes a difference
 		as to how many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> vote apparently not being a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizen</ENAMEX> not not serving on jury duty is important enough to them that they don't want to have any say
 		in uh politics
 	
 	
 		hum
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">okay</ENAMEX> and then what about the smaller election say some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> elections uh even down to the uh school <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> type uh elections i guess there are so many
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		that you can uh weed out the ones that you really want to partake in
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		well
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last November</TIMEX> was my <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> election in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> i've only lived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> a little over a year
 		and i went down this long list of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judges</ENAMEX> that i was voting for
 		and
 		i mean i didn't know anything about any of these races i didn't know what the responsibilities of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judges</ENAMEX> were i didn't know anything about the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> who's names were on the ballet
 		and i'm going you know how can i possibly make an informed choice here
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so what's the point in voting for these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> i i mean it you know i get just as good of results as if i through <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">darts</ENAMEX> at a board
 	
 	
 		right
 		well it's a shame that uh that even the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politician</ENAMEX> who wants to give give out good information about himself
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">uh</ENAMEX> has trouble in virtually everything he does say that's positive or or even mediocre gets attacked from the other side
 		such that he spends more of his time defending than he can putting forth any decent information
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> and then once you get off the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX>'s personal information then you want to get into an actual issue and then how the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> feels about that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		there's there's very little room for or very little time to handle all the different things you'd like to know about a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> and then unfortunately after you do get some of that information you may find out it weren't true to begin with  so
 	
 	
 		yeah you you think then that uh part of it is because the uh it flashes too much on the personal uh characteristics of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> rather than his uh
 		job performance issues
 	
 	
 		i would say that it's much easier to deal with the the the public the uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> that's that's giving the information to the public is much easier to deal with uh any personality quirk or any negatives that they've found or any skeleton in the closet
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		than to try and first educate the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> to the point where they can
 		listen to either side of a given issue
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> and it's pretty difficult to deal with some of the issues lets say that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texas State uh Railroad Commission</ENAMEX> has to solve when you don't even fathom what the implications are of they're decision so who would you care who got in that position you know
 	
 	
 		i'd i'd say
 		yeah i'd say there's a large number especially of urban young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> that don't know what the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Railroad Commission</ENAMEX> does
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and so they go you know who who who what does it matter who i vote for
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i think well that's one thing i've noticed i've i've lived a couple of different places i've noticed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> seems to have more elective <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> than any place i've ever been
 	
 	
 		so hence more apathy  i guess or confusion
 	
 	
 		well a lot more confusion you know i in in other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> i've never called upon to decide all this long list of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judges</ENAMEX> i've never been called upon to decide
 		you know  we're we're voting for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Railroad</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commissioner</ENAMEX> and and uh Land <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commissioner</ENAMEX> and that sort of thing and in other state these would be appointments of the governor
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		we wouldn't be expected to cast a ballet on the subject
 	
 	
 		hum <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> that makes the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX>'s vote a whole lot more important doesn't it
 	
 	
 		well it does
 	
 	
 		yeah a lot more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">appointee</ENAMEX>'s i guess makes him carry a lot more weight
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		but it also means you've got a unified state government you don't have different <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">departments</ENAMEX> pulling against each other
 	
 	
 		that's probably well worth it then it probably be worth it just to do away with the cost of the elections and uh put it in the hands of maybe <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who can at least get his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> together
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
  
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so hum
 	
 	
 		the the the big problem i guess with the the mass <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> is you know
 		uh you don't have time to educate the public on these matters because the public is not going to sit still and  soak the message in
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i mean anything that can't be covered in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">seconds</TIMEX> or less they're not going to care about it
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		or or if you can't dramatize it and put it on <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Unsolved Mysteries</ENAMEX> then they're not going to you know they're not going to want to hear it
 	
 	
 		do you find it convenient to vote the actual time of day type where you have to go and the line you have to stand in
 	
 	
 		uh the the line what i waited maybe <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">ten minutes</TIMEX> in line
 		it was it was uh a minor inconvenience it was certainly
 		worth it to me i think
 	
 	
 		did you go <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early in the morning</TIMEX> or
 	
 	
 		i went right after work so that was when the line is the longest
 	
 	
 		after work
 		hum that's interesting
 		well where in my little district fortunately it is literally across the street i could walk over there as it were we live across from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> and so we
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i drive out of my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early in the morning</TIMEX> and go over there usually before the polls even open and and vote right at the you know number one or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sometimes the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> in in line
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i wait <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">longer to</TIMEX> to watch them set up than i do actually in the in the line itself but that gets me out of there at a time that i can go down <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Central</ENAMEX> and not be bothered by the the traffic as it were
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		because normally i'm i'm at work before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven</TIMEX> so uh just stay a little later that as it were and and make the the effort to vote
 		uh but unfortunately since there are so many other things that uh our <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> wants to vote on
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		they don't they they tend to make the elections if it's a not important election as it were they only open a few of the poles
 		so i don't always i don't always vote at the same place so it's a little bit more trouble for me to well this election's going to be held this date and i've got to go over here
 	
 	
 		so you have to go a little out of your way huh
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i've got to remember uh you know on this election i'm in this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">district</ENAMEX> in this election i'm for here and uh you know this precinct votes here
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i would just assume in holding still and all vote in the same place as many times as they want
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i would also like better
 		information on
 		on what on you know what am i voting on and and who just some general statements about the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> i guess this is the kind of thing you expect from the newspapers
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i didn't see much of it
 		like you know i see you saw a lot about the major races but a lot of the minor ones that you're being called upon to decide there's very little information on
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		as far as you know what what is the duties of this political <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> and uh and what are the characteristics or what what are the
 		issued statements and
 		uh spoken goals of the uh candidates
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i'd like to get
 	
 	
 		probably wouldn't even hurt to have a section that says here's how this particular office affected you or could have affected you over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last several years</TIMEX> you know these are the kinds of decisions that this particular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> or this particular
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">uh Railroad Commission</ENAMEX> for instance does
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		if if you know if he he does do something or you pay attention to this or this is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> to to blame for this if uh you didn't like what happened
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you are right there is no uh no such deal other than the small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publication</ENAMEX> that uh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">uh League of Women Voters</ENAMEX> puts out it supplements that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX> that i get a local newspaper they they published but uh nothing per se in the major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX> and as hungry as they are for things to print you'd think they'd want to do that
 	
 	
 		yeah well they the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dallas Morning News</ENAMEX> did publish a a section that covered the major <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">races</ENAMEX> and it explained a lot to me about the individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> and helped me make a lot of
 		better informed decisions
 		but still uh
 		you know it it left a lot of the the the local races the races unique to my precinct
 		uh up in the air there is one thing that that did annoy me and that is the the my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">congressman</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last fall</TIMEX> didn't have anybody running against him so basically i had no choice
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i think uh
 		in some districts you know there's a a party <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> or another that has such a lock on it
 		that uh you know why vote when it's decided already
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		that sort of attitude
 	
 	
 		that's true
 		with so many elected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> i guess there's just so many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to go around  in some of those cases
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		hum well i hear someone calling me so i better let you go
 	
 	
 		well we used the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five minutes</TIMEX> up
 	
 	
 		yeah at least  bye
 	
 	
 		okay
 		all right bye
