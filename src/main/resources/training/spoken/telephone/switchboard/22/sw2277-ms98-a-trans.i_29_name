 
     		
 	
 		have you had to put anyone in a nursing home
 	
 	
 		no but my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> was in a nursing home
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		and she was in there she got sick
 		and they put her in a nursing home because you couldn't we couldn't afford a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurse</ENAMEX>
 		to you know all <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all day</TIMEX> nurse
 	
 	
 		yeah <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty four hours</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah well at least as they told us uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> shifts
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		you know that's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixteen hours</TIMEX> because one would come in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX> and one would be at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> i mean in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the afternoon</TIMEX> and then that night it wouldn't need one
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know because she would be sleeping so i would be here then
 	
 	
 		yeah that would seem like that would be uh more expensive than a uh
 		nursing nursing home wouldn't it
 	
 	
 		well the nursing home is covered by uh social security see
 	
 	
 		oh and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurse</ENAMEX> at home isn't oh okay i got you
 	
 	
 		and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurses</ENAMEX> aren't no
 		see you have to pay that
 	
 	
 		yeah i didn't know that
 	
 	
 		and oh yeah if you put nursing home and that's another thing i
 		you know you got to find a good nursing home is very hard to find because the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> don't care most of them don't care some of them do care
 		the work that you know the the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurse aide</ENAMEX> that what the problem is i think it's the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurses</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aide</ENAMEX> they don't pay them enough to keep them there
 		and to do the things that they need to do
 	
 	
 		now well my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> in law was working with uh
 		in one for a little bit and uh he just he couldn't handle the things he had to do
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know uh cleaning up after <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> using the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">restroom</ENAMEX> and stuff he he he couldn't handle it
 	
 	
 		oh yeah it's gets bad some of them and then it depends on the nursing home and how bad it is
 		you know because they have some nursing home that don't have anybody that's not
 		walking you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and it just depends on how bad that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> is
 	
 	
 		well seems to me if a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> gets into that area
 		they i i don't know it seems like if you're going to get in that area and spend the time learning it because you do have to go to school on some of it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		you ought to do your job
 	
 	
 		yeah and um
 	
 	
 		and if you can't if you can't i think they should get out of it instead of mistreating the people
 	
 	
 		yeah i i've heard a lot of bad things about them mistreating <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and uh
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		i've even heard of some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> being sexually abused
 	
 	
 		they steal yeah that and they steal
 	
 	
 		yeah they steal from them
 	
 	
 		uh oh yeah i used to take uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every week</TIMEX> you know i have to threaten it which it doesn't make sense for me to have to sit there and threaten uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> um that work there
 	
 	
 		i didn't
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know like i bring her i bought her a blanket and i had this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> hand crocheted her a lap blanket you know because she sits in a wheel chair but she can walk they just sit them in wheel chairs
 		and i told her uh i came up there <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the following week</TIMEX> and it was gone i said where is it she said in the washer i said i tell you what when i come back it better be here
 		because they went to the washer we didn't find it i said you all better find it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and you know bedspread her bedspread she i took her a bedspread because she a comforter because she was always cold
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and so uh you know then  i had to put write the name on the whole bedspread i'm talking uh like it's
 	
 	
 		in each square
 	
 	
 		it almost  you know on both sides so that they can't turn it over and put it on somebody else's bed
 	
 	
 		
 
 		all over
 		that's that's not right
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">huh-uh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i've i've only known <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in a nursing home and you know it was my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandmother</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandfather</ENAMEX> on my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>'s side and i just heard through my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> what was going on and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah well see this this one i i is more or less first hand you know she just died um
 		we buried her <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February</TIMEX> but she had been in there at least i know for
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven years eight years</TIMEX>
 		and he didn't want to put her in there but he can't afford it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and that's another thing you know
 	
 	
 		yeah something i guess you get forced to do make decisions and
 	
 	
 		but you don't have it depends on when didn't you you have a choice the only thing i can say is you have a choice of where they go sometimes
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		sometimes you don't
 		and then you have to check out the nursing home and the only way you're going to check out a nursing home is to actually put them in there and check on them every time but don't tell the people
 	
 	
 		what time you going to come in just come in  uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		you have to do one of them you know spontaneous things like maybe <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three o'clock in the afternoon</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one o'clock in the afternoon</TIMEX> and stuff like that because they're not expecting you
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		you know they expect you <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> like on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturdays Friday</TIMEX> you know <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturdays</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sundays</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX> and stuff but not during the week
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">hum-um</ENAMEX>
 		it gets bad it is nursing home i think is sometimes i think some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> put them in there and then they just die that's about what it's for
 		and it's really not some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> don't need to be in there
 	
 	
 		you know that's what i've heard too you know i heard that they just put them in there because they don't want to mess with them
 	
 	
 		that's right and i don't think that's right i think they should have a place to some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that don't need to be in the nursing home with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurses</ENAMEX> they need to have a place for them like a retirement home
 	
 	
 		well yeah i've heard uh some things you know uh i i don't where i heard it from it might have been a movie or something where they made a apartment <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> into a
 		what you're saying for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who can take care of themselves but they they uh need a little help in doing it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		don't
 		yeah
 		and see that would be okay you could have somebody check on each <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of them <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX> you know go by and see what they need
 	
 	
 		yeah each of them have their own little <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> or little
 	
 	
 		little place to live you know even just a little room
 		or whatever
 	
 	
 		yeah well do they share <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> in nursing homes
 	
 	
 		sometimes yeah it depends on the patient
 		and and i guess sometimes the availability of that of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> and how they done built the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>
 		because i know one <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX> like she had a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">roommate</ENAMEX> but the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> across the hall didn't have one
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		get my purse uh
 		but it it it you know it just to me nursing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> are um
 	
 	
 		bad news
 	
 	
 		bad news unless you can find a really good one
 		and those are rare but there are some good ones and there are some bad ones
 		i mean
 	
 	
 		well i'll i'll say something i said in the last conversation i hope i'm never in that position where i have to be put in one uh from all i've heard about it just not and i've heard
 	
 	
 		i told my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> well is this weird because see what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> don't understand is even the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that work in the nursing home they will get old one day
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and everything that they do to somebody will come back to them that's the way i feel yeah
 	
 	
 		well if it ain't uh well you know uh
 	
 	
 		or maybe that won't not make it that far in life
 		for what they did to somebody but
 	
 	
 		well
 		yeah i have my beliefs in the hereafter and i believe that uh God will take care of them
 	
 	
 		that's the whole that's what i think i think God will definitely get uh you know uh
 		there's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that i know you should not mess uh abuse and that's a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> and a someone <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> that's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elderly</ENAMEX> you shouldn't abuse anybody but but down right
 	
 	
 		true
 	
 	
 		them people them <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are the most helpless <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> you see what i'm saying
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know they can't really defend themselves like somebody grown uh say my age you know yeah
 	
 	
 		or mine yeah i got you there
 	
 	
 		because i can tell somebody to go leave me alone
 		but they so old
 	
 	
 		or you can force them to do it if you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		you can force their hand more or less but see somebody that old they don't know
 	
 	
 		yeah uh
 	
 	
 		and then what they what are they going to do and if they tell anybody <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> always say oh they're just senile
 		you know huh-uh  and that ain't right neither
 	
 	
 		no it's not
 	
 	
 		so
 		it it it gets bad you know it just depends on like i said the nursing home now my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandmother</ENAMEX> was in a nursing home in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>
 		before she died but it was a nice nursing home for you know it was one of the nice ones
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but now my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mom</ENAMEX> and them had to pay for that too
 	
 	
 		yeah i was going to say you have to pay something like <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three and four</NUMEX> times more
 	
 	
 		you have to pay more you know social security covers so much and then um you have to pay some more and she chose to pay some more
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		if she you know since it was like my my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandmother</ENAMEX> had
 		thirteen <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> so they all you know paid their month
 		which was better  but see my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>'s a only child
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah and then he'd have to pay it all
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah i know what big <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> are like and how they can get together if you if they're really cooperative and wanting the best
 	
 	
 		if yeah see and then there's another thing she told me is you have to make sure everybody cooperates because like by her her being there if someone if one of her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brothers</ENAMEX> didn't send in their check
 		she would have to pay it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know and wait for him to whenever he decide to pay it  you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well i know my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mom</ENAMEX> from a family of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least sixteen</TIMEX> i've lost count uh and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandmother</ENAMEX> just died sometime last well <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about two years ago</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh they was all talking about pulling together and paying for the uh
 		hospital costs and stuff and uh you know there's some of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> that's not exactly in the homeless level but you know darn close
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh then there's others who is uh-huh lots better off
 	
 	
 		just pretty
 		oh yeah see that's what that's what gets me like <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">well</ENAMEX> just like my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> he has got his <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> bedroom house
 	
 	
 		and
 	
 	
 		in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> with the swimming pool and here i am renting a house barely making it
 	
 	
 		you know well in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> too i've got a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> that lives out there and uh she's got a little <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedroom house</ENAMEX> with a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garage</ENAMEX> a double car <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garage</ENAMEX> and it's costing her a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">thousand dollars</NUMEX> a month
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> is high
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and then you know it's like i tell him you make more money than i do than i could ever really think about if i made as much money as my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> i would be just like set for life
 	
 	
 		that's what we keep saying
 	
 	
 		you know but not him he's never happy and i think that's that's why he makes as much as he do is because he keeps thriving for more
 	
 	
 		uh well that's
 	
 	
 		which i probably if i got what i wanted i'd be okay
 		you know
 	
 	
 		well that's a good initiative uh i guess if but
