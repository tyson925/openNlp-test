 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		well um discussing air pollution <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> i guess
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um
 		uh well  give me your first impressions
 	
 	
 		uh i don't know there's a lot of air pollution
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um i think industries and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> provide a lot of it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and with uh
 		i guess with the oil burning over in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuwait</ENAMEX> and stuff that would have a lot of air pollution in it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">uh</ENAMEX> puts a whole yeah gets a whole new picture to what  real air pollution can be
 		but uh that stuff going on over there what what uh what part of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> are you in
 	
 	
 		um i'm north of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX> so
 	
 	
 		okay okay
 		okay so it's it's it's amazing too you know you with that with the oil <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wells</ENAMEX> burning over there that's that's the exact same stuff that's coming out of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX> just in uh just in a little different grade i guess
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> we've got
 		we've just uh
 		brought in a whole new set of uh requirements on inspections and things like that for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> because uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> just don't use mass transit and stuff in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> everybody loves their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> and
 		you see an awful lot of uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> vehicles on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> on during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">rush hours</TIMEX> that seems to be our biggest problem down here um
 		you know there's uh
 		there's a lot of industry around but uh it's not it's any pollution that industry's dumping around here is not going into the air it's typically water  type situation
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um we have a couple we have like a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">steel mill</ENAMEX> and a couple <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">refineries</ENAMEX> and stuff and i know there's a lot of air pollution going in there and like they they get fined whenever they do the air pollution but
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		the fine is nothing you know it's like nothing to them
 	
 	
 		yeah it's it's yeah like like <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two hours</TIMEX> of output or something like that yeah that's true that's true
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah i uh i grew up in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Dakota</ENAMEX> so i was never  i was never exposed to anything of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">of the</ENAMEX> of the sort um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		there were always the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and what not were always telling us that uh farm <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemicals</ENAMEX> and what not were destroying our water system and all that but we just we just never saw the results uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		there was there was dust in the air during uh planting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seasons</TIMEX> and what not but uh that that was all we ever saw and then
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five years ago</TIMEX> i i moved to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> and i suddenly start to understand what uh burning eyes uh and all that stuff is about that i'd always heard about
 		it uh
 		it's it gets it's real depressing um
 		in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX> sometime uh just you you can tell if it's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a good day</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a bad day</TIMEX> by uh how far out from downtown uh you you can be on the road and still not see it
 	
 	
 		oh my God
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		yeah you know i mean it's not uh i don't think <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> is considered uh a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a real bad</TIMEX>
 		place for for air pollution but you you can tell you can tell the differences in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the days</TIMEX> when it's when the haze is kind of yellowish gray instead of just being a a foggy misty color
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh it it's a little it's a little disappointing sometimes that you start to realize what you're breathing
 	
 	
 		uh yeah but
 		i i don't know what they can do to really prevent it you know like how can what can they do about the oil burning over in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuwait</ENAMEX> what you know i mean they fine the the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">industries</ENAMEX> but
 		you know that doesn't seem to stop them there i don't know what else they can do
 	
 	
 		right
 		right it's it's
 		that there really isn't a whole lot it's it's one of those uh
 		it's one of those things that if they do a little bit and uh and every you know every every little bit does help i i do believe that
 		um but i also believe that uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">earth</ENAMEX> is is a kind of a self-regulating system and uh it will clean itself up eventually
 		it the whole idea is not to not to push the limit too hard i guess let let the you know let the natural natural systems take care of the problem as much as possible
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah i i yeah i just don't understand you know what else anyone can do about it i don't think it's something that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> really think about either
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know it's i mean i it it should probably be a big issue you know because it's it's doing a lot of damage but i it's something you know i don't think many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> really think about it because it's nothing they i don't think we really have too much control over it
 	
 	
 		right and it's one of those things it's it's it's so hard to measure uh what what what the damage is it's it's kind of like uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh i guess it's kind of like kind of like cigarette smoking you know it it
 		it it could go on for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> until they they start start to see some results and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> can actually actually say yeah it's it's it's doing it's doing some damage and and something's got to be done
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um there's you know there's a lot of things like that it it it you can uh
 		you can pound on something for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a long time</TIMEX> before it finally breaks but until it breaks you don't really know that there  you were doing anything to it
 	
 	
 		yeah exactly
 	
 	
 		but uh
 	
 	
 		well i really don't know
 		too much else about it
 	
 	
 		yeah well that's it you know i i i think we both agree it's it's one of those deals that uh i just think there's a lot of other problems <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">right now</TIMEX> and uh we've done a lot to take care of it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah we have tried i mean you know and um i i know where you know where a couple of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mills</ENAMEX> that have
 		i know i know they put things on their stacks you know to filter the smoke and do all kinds of things but i mean every <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">now</TIMEX> and then it breaks you know and and you just got smoke going out into the air for a day or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> till you can get it fixed and stuff
 	
 	
 		oh sure
 		sure
 	
 	
 		so you know it's something we we have tried to help but yeah
 	
 	
 		oh there's no doubt about i don't know if you if you ever happened to see uh
 		some of the like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Twenty Twenty</ENAMEX> and what not about uh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Romania</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East Germany</ENAMEX> when they first got pictures out of there about how some of their uh systems had been running for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty years</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		um
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh you know they absolutely no regulations no controls whatsoever and they had destroyed entire forests and what not just because the air was so polluted
 		that's that's the kind of things that uh you don't see in this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> and that's that's why i think that you know it's it's i don't know if you can ever do enough but uh
 		i think it's all relative to the to the time and place and i think right now it's it's it's pretty much under control
 	
 	
 		yeah okay well um-hum it's been nice talking to you okay bye-bye
 	
 	
 		all righty
 		well you bet
 		bye
