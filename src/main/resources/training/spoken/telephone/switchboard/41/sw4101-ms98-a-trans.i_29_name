 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um i'm starting to split stuff split split stuff off the only disadvantage is that they don't pick it up at the curb they make me drive it like a mile down the road and split it out down there what are they doing up there
 	
 	
 		well here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saskatoon</ENAMEX> um  much the same thing there is no curb pick up of uh
 		any of the recycled products uh we're in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about a hundred and eighty thousand</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>  uh  there are areas where we could uh  actually we have a couple of the uh
 		handicapped societies type of places where they uh
 		one they do as just a recycling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX> and then others they uh collect the paper and ship it to other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">retailers</ENAMEX> so uh we're able to uh
 		have drop off bins for news <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX> and cardboard and that kind of thing and then there are
 		there's a uh deposit program on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plastic</ENAMEX> and glass containers well primarily soft <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drink</ENAMEX> bottles and so we're able to uh  take it to one of the uh
 		rehabilitation <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> and then they recycle the containers  they refund the deposit which is anywhere from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">fifteen cents</NUMEX> a container and then
 	
 	
 		but the deposits only on like drink stuff
 	
 	
 		right yeah on the on primarily on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">soft drink</ENAMEX> pop and that kind of thing
 	
 	
 		okay
 		okay
 	
 	
 		and uh so they induce recycling of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plastic</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glass soft drink</ENAMEX> containers uh we do have
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one one</NUMEX> of the scrap metal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX> that will accept tin and aluminum  cans as well
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		and and actually the recycler there is a deposit on aluminum pop cans and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beer</ENAMEX> cans and so the recycler uh with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">handicapped group</ENAMEX> will also accept those so
 		uh it's fairly fairly extensive but again it's uh it's the initiative of the individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> because there is no coordinated pick up by the city
 	
 	
 		so is they you're giving are you giving these products to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">handicapped group</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">handicapped group</ENAMEX> is getting the uh the money
 		or or you got or they somehow distributing the funds back to you
 	
 	
 		well actually there's
 		there's the opportunity for both
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		generally the uh
 		the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">handicapped group</ENAMEX> takes care of the things that actually the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> has placed a deposit which is the inducement to recycle recycle the bottle so that you get your money back
 		and then the recycler run by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">handicapped society</ENAMEX> pays back the cost of that deposit
 		and then i have a then then they in turn will get  some money from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bottlers</ENAMEX> and from the the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that do the canning of the pop and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beer</ENAMEX> as as well
 	
 	
 		that's very cool you know there's a i i heard about a a similar program in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York City</ENAMEX> where uh i think it's called <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">like Homeless Incorporated</ENAMEX> or something like that but what they do is employ um homeless i think mostly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> but homeless people
 		to uh go out and collect all the recyclable cans and and i think it's mostly cans there may be bottles as well but like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beer</ENAMEX> cans <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">soda</ENAMEX> cans and what not and they uh bring them up to a one
 		location one centralized location and uh are able to collect the money from the various <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beer</ENAMEX> and and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">soda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturers</ENAMEX> and uh and and get more money to these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that desperately need it
 	
 	
 		um yeah  um i guess partly because of our climate here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saskatoon</ENAMEX> at least the majority of
 		Central <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> uh well i want to say <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central Canada</ENAMEX> but <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Central Canada</ENAMEX> tends to be referred more to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ontario</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Quebec</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 		but um
 		we don't have much of a situation where we might call them homeless <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> we certainly have a fair number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that are on welfor welfare and unemployment insurance that kind of thing  um
 		there's psychological pressure against
 		employing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to do that kind of thing although um
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">scouts</ENAMEX> and
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hockey</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> and ball <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> those kinds um regularly do bottle drives where they go around in various neighborhoods and collecting the bottles at individual homes
 	
 	
 		do they do it with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX> as well
 	
 	
 		they have done it some
 		um but we have actually quite an extensive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> of collecting uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX> they're actually at
 		virtually all of the shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> like the shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">malls</ENAMEX> there are several containers where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cosmopolitan Industries</ENAMEX>
 		collects or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> can drop their used <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX> and other papers in the bins and then the bins are collected
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		um some of the
