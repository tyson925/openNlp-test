 
		 		
 			
 				
 					 				
 			
 			
 				
 					 				
 			
 			
 				so uh do you happen to be working for a large firm
 			
 			
 				well it's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about three hundred and fifty</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> i guess that's not large compared to some but it's big enough
 			
 			
 				<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 			
 			
 				and they have a
 				they don't have any kind of pension plan where they contribute anything and i wish they did
 			
 			
 				yeah
 			
 			
 				you know they have a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">401K</TIMEX> but i put all the money into it
 			
 			
 				<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 			
 			
 				they don't add anything what about you
 			
 			
 				uh i work for a fairly large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> it's got <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight thousand</NUMEX> people
 			
 			
 				<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 			
 			
 				and uh we do have health insurance and
 				we don't have <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4O1K</TIMEX> plan stuff like that but we do have like
 				retirement they kind of match up to you if you put <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">six percent</NUMEX> they match up to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">six percent</NUMEX> and then  the rest is whatever you want to put in if you put more than that or something like that
 			
 			
 				oh that's a pretty good deal
 			
 			
 				that's not bad
 			
 			
 				now how long does it take for your contribution to vest
 			
 			
 				God i don't know  it's probably a long time  i'm sure it's not till like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty five years thirty years</TIMEX>
 			
 			
 				yeah the place i work at is health insurance is kind of expensive it's like you know <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundred</NUMEX> bucks a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a month</TIMEX> or something for a family
 			
 			
 				
 					 				
 				yeah
 				huh well i guess what we have is like a flex what they call a flex benefits plan where you
 				you get like a certain amount of dollars and then you spend it on a cafeteria of whatever you want or need otherwise you can uh
 				guess you can put also put money hold money back and then
 				either use it or lose it and that doesn't get taxed or you can just have that money
 				you know put in your paycheck
 			
 			
 				yeah we have one of those use it or lose it plans too where uh they'll basically pay for uh you know child care type uh expenses i can send in a uh
 				can send in a request for payment and they'll uh and they'll send me you know a check for the amount they withheld
 				that's pretty good you know it's uh it saves a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> off on taxes or something
 			
 			
 				yeah well it depends on which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> you work for i know that like the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the the one</TIMEX> plan that everyone seems to be in in my place is uh
 				you know you uh think you call it plan D  deductibles are really high it's like fifteen <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">hundred dollars</NUMEX>
 				but if you go for the other ones you're paying too much money for them because it's unlikely if you're fairly relatively uh healthy then it's really unlikely that you're gonna use that much amount of money you know
 				so the it you know someone did start a cost benefit analysis and ends up the best is they take a high deductible and and take a loss whatever whatever happens a be if you happen to be a healthy individual
 			
 			
 				yeah i guess uh on the other hand you know i i had a similar had a similar health plan and uh
 				<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> was in a car accident and and i had wound up having to pay for you know a bunch of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> visits and stuff out of my pocket because of
 			
 			
 				um
 			
 			
 				you know no no insurance policy happened to cover it which is
 			
 			
 				really you mean not even your 					dour your car insurance
 			
 			
 				well it it got all screwed up because i had a high deductible on the health insurance no fault here and and i had a high deductible on the  on the uh
 				on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> car insurance and then  you know we
 				just goofed up the medical insurance and the car insurance and stuff and
 			
 			
 				oh that's too bad
 			
 			
 				blew it  oh well
 			
 			
 				yeah uh well i don't know i think other than health insurance i think uh you know an extra week of uh  time off would be nice i only get <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks</TIMEX>
 			
 			
 				
 					 				
 				yeah yeah my place you get <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks</TIMEX> when you start and then every <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every year</TIMEX> they give you an extra day until you've got <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four weeks</TIMEX>
 			
 			
 				oh that's nice we don't get them till till your <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seventh year</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">service</ENAMEX> till you get an extra week
 			
 			
 				aye
 				that's a long time
 			
 			
 				yeah it's uh
 			
 			
 				yeah especially in the kind of engineering job i'm in you know <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> don't stay afloat that long  and and they
 			
 			
 				uh with the telecommunications
 				type of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> supposedly you used it used to be much more stable it's a lot less stable than it used to be they used to have job security and crap
 				but now they don't
 			
 			
 				so you work for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bell</ENAMEX> or something like that
 			
 			
 				yeah it's the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bell Corps</ENAMEX> which is uh
 			
 			
 				right right
 			
 			
 				yeah so i don't know it's it's uh no longer  so that's what i think it's still based on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the old</TIMEX> model of
 				and and now they don't uh
 			
 			
 				a lifelong job security telephone <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pioneers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> all that stuff huh
 			
 			
 				yeah
 				yeah but the the 					no no longer  i don't think so
 			
 			
 				
 					 				
 				right
 			
 			
 				uh hearing a lot there's always they're always laying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> off which is another benefit
 				that you that you can have other than salary is trade that off for security
 			
 			
 				oh does is it i mean does it they must have pretty good severance though huh
 			
 			
 				ah i don't know we don't we haven't been doing layoffs we've been doing uh down sizing with uh getting rid of extra layers of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> and uh i don't know what they do for those people
 			
 			
 				i mean the the the management they get rid of
 			
 			
 				some of it yeah there's too many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> too many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chiefs</ENAMEX> and not enough <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indians</ENAMEX> but
 			
 			
 				um
 				oh they they put
