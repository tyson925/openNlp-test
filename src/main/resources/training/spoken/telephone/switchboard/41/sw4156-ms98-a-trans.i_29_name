 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so uh do you keep a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</TIMEX> budget or anything like that oh yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i i'm one of those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who keep a record of everything
 	
 	
 		
  
 		oh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so you you keep record of all the checks you write and all the credit card
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A T M</ENAMEX> transactions and everything and i've got a file for each of them and
 	
 	
 		
  
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		
  
 		how do you categorize these things that's what always sort of stumped me when i sat down to do it right huh
 	
 	
 		i i have a file box and each file has a little piece of paper on it and each file there i have a file for each month of the year
 	
 	
 		
  
 		okay
 	
 	
 		and then i also have files for like credit card receipts and when the bills come in for the credit cards they go in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the month</TIMEX> that they have to be paid for
 	
 	
 		
  
 		okay um so this insures that you know what your bills are and that they get paid
 	
 	
 		right
 		unless i get paid on time like like for instance if a bill is due on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March fourth</TIMEX> i'll just i'll put it in the folder with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX> and that way when i get paid in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX> i know that whatever bill is in there have to be paid in that month
 	
 	
 		
  
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		
  
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		
  
 		okay so that insures that the bills get paid before other things get paid for now do you uh-huh go ahead
 	
 	
 		right and that
 		and that way i keep a running list of what bills i do have and that way i know if i have any extra money or not
 	
 	
 		
  
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		
  
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">okay</ENAMEX> and uh what happens then when you don't
 		
  
 	
 	
 		when i don't what
 	
 	
 		have extra money
 		
  
 	
 	
 		then i don't do anything  i've got <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> little boys
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so i'm at home most of the time anyways but
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		like once in a while like when my taxes came back i had extra money so i paid a babysitter to watch my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> and i went to i went to goofing off and you know just something little like that but it's something that you really got to keep an eye on when you have kids
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		
  
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		because you're always got to have money when you have kids
 	
 	
 		
  
 		oh yeah so do you do anything about you know saying hey i'm willing to spend this much <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a month</TIMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> and this much <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a month</TIMEX> on
 	
 	
 		well i have a i have a running budget for every month
 	
 	
 		clothing or
 		
  
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and on that budget i type up a budget for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every month in the year</TIMEX> and it has the bills that i know i have <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every month</TIMEX> electric phone food the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pediatrician</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
  
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		
  
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Visa</ENAMEX> bill you you know all the bills i know i have <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every month</TIMEX> are on that budget
 	
 	
 		
  
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and so once all of those get paid i go through my file and see if there is anything else and if there's not then i know that money the rest of the money is mine
 	
 	
 		
  
 		so is food in that list also and so you have a certain amount you spend on
 	
 	
 		oh yes
 	
 	
 		groceries that you expect to spend for each month
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">okay</ENAMEX> and things like um now some some expenses come up you know twice <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> or once a year like insurance
 	
 	
 		right or well that comes up <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every six months</TIMEX> for me or like tags come up once a year and you've got to figure that in too
 	
 	
 		
  
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		
  
 		so you have an entry for each month for those things
 	
 	
 		right whenever my tags come up uh there is an entry right there that says tags and then i just leave the space blank until i find out how much i owe for my tags and then i get them and that way i know i know that they have to be paid in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that month</TIMEX> so i'm expecting it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		
  
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		and and so you i mean <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each month before</TIMEX> that do you put away you know <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one tenth one</NUMEX> twelfth of it or
 	
 	
 		
 
 		no usually i just pay it out of whatever paycheck uh is in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that month</TIMEX> because after i pay my regular bills i usually have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately a hundred</NUMEX> and fifty dollars and with that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundred</NUMEX> and fifty dollars i pay things that come up like insurance
 	
 	
 		
  
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		
  
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		
  
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		or tags or whatever happens to come up in that month
 	
 	
 		
  
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i could pay with that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundred</NUMEX> and fifty dollars and then what's  left i can do what what i want with
 	
 	
 		
  
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh</ENAMEX> so now what about the uh long term considerations like retirement and college and stuff
 	
 	
 		well i've got an annuity fund set up because i don't know uh just the way i was raised i look toward the future
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		
  
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		not only for my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> but for myself and i've got an annuity for me and every <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two months</TIMEX> i buy my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> each a savings bond
 	
 	
 		
  
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		every since they have been born i've been doing that
 	
 	
 		
  
 		that sounds great
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		um so now what exactly in an annuity i've always found those a little confusing
 	
 	
 		an annuity is an account it's like a uh it's it's a type of savings account okay but you don't touch it you just deposit money into it but you don't touch it other than that and it just sits there and gains interest until your retirement
 	
 	
 		
  
 		okay
 		
  
 		okay now do you pay taxes on the interest
 		
  
 	
 	
 		not right now
 	
 	
 		okay only when you draw it out
 	
 	
 		if
 		right
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		and like if <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elderly people</ENAMEX> they have a choice of having an IRA account and they get special discounts on like the um
 	
 	
 		
  
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		
  
 	
 	
 		what's the word i'm trying to think of the interest charges and stuff if they have an IRA they get special rates on it and stuff
 	
 	
 		you mean from the you mean from taxes or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">from</NUMEX> from the federal government you mean uh-huh
 	
 	
 		right
 		right for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elderly people</ENAMEX> and stuff that have IRAs set up and they get special discounts on that but an an annuity is
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		it's a savings account that you don't withdraw anything out of you just keep depositing money into it
 	
 	
 		okay now i guess the question is is it better than an
