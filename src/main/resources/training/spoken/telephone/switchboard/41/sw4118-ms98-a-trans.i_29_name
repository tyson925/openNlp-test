 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		um i don't know um does your do you have recycling in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Atlanta</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh yeah i see  seen some uh there's some <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trucks</ENAMEX> that come around kind of like garbage <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trucks</ENAMEX> they have like <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> different big containers on them and they'll go and uh
 		and collect collect it but i think the i think it's pretty expensive to do
 	
 	
 		uh-huh do you have to do you have to do the sorting or do they do the sorting for you
 	
 	
 		well from i can tell what i've seen of it they have different color containers and uh you sort of sort it out uh
 		in your <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> and then put it out on the curb and they and they just throw the matching color uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum into the different box
 	
 	
 		container yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah  up here like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Hampshire</ENAMEX> doesn't uh well where i am uh we don't have any recycling we don't even have a bottle bill or anything like that and that's
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		that's not real
 		that's not real popular with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> around us because
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		the the extra nickel or what is it extra <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">thirty cents</NUMEX> for a for a for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> bottles everybody everybody comes across the border  to buy the cheaper the the cheaper drinks
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but
 		i i i i think that well i do some recycling like i save my my bottles and things like that but i don't think i do as as much i think i could do more
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i
 		there's a big problem here with like landfills
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh like
 		they the the landfills are just are just like filling up with stuff
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i think that if if they were to recycle if i were to i guess if if there was like some kind of a program i would do it because just so that we could save the space in those things
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well uh it's kind of funny i saw um a special on a public public broadcasting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">station</ENAMEX> down here and uh they were talking about recycling and
 		they they uh i i forgot exactly where this was but
 		they were showing just piles and piles of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plastic</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glass</ENAMEX> that uh was at a recycling <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> but it was costing them uh
 		<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about forty dollars</NUMEX> a ton to recycle and they could only get <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about ten</NUMEX> dollars a ton for it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so  so you know there was just uh no nothing in it for them
 	
 	
 		i i was
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		i i don't know when i was in when i i was  <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> i went to a class and and uh we would we they they brought it this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> that uh that made
 		let's see he made he made a lot of money working because because like in in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Massachusetts</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vermont</ENAMEX> and all the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> around <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Hampshire</ENAMEX> they put in this bottle bill do you have a bottle bill down there
 	
 	
 		i'm not sure i
 	
 	
 		that's where it's like every <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">every every every</TIMEX> can is stamped with like a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a nickel</NUMEX> return on it
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and it's like you you have to like if you can turn the can in to to any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX> and they have to pay you a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nickel</ENAMEX> for it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but what happens is that then all these cans come running you know some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> get more cans than they sell and they have a big problem with that but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		the law says that if they sell they have to collect
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but anyway this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> like all the like the beer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">distributors</ENAMEX> were having like the biggest problem and uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		he
 		he he actually like made a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX> that just went around from like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">distributor</ENAMEX> to distributor
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		collecting like all the cans and he said like some things like the aluminum cans
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		they they could make money on because <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aluminum</ENAMEX> can be they can just throw that back into the pot
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and that just gets melted back up and that's not a problem but um like the plastic ones you said like you were saying
 		they they lost like big money on because they can't recycle they can't reuse the some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plastics</ENAMEX> can be reused but most <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plastics</ENAMEX> can't be remelded remolded or melted melted into into other things
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and it just becomes more of a pain than it's worth
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but i don't know i i wonder you know should
 		should they be making things that like just can't be reused
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh
 		it kind of i i don't i don't and well
 		should i be buying things that can't be reused
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah it's uh
 		uh
 		something i think about a lot too is you know when you're buying
 		everything is you know if it's not convenient <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> don't want it
 		and usually convenience means waste
 	
 	
 		i
 		yeah well you know  i i can't something i can't figure out is it
 		do you every do you every did you ever see those big old <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Coke</ENAMEX> bottles you know the glass ones that were like they were kind of green
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		at at what point in time did it get to be
 		at what you know i didn't i thought they were great but at what point in time did it get to be worse
 	
 	
 		yeah
