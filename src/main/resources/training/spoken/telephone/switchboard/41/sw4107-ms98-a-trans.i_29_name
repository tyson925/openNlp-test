 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		so well what what are you <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> doing with recycling
 	
 	
 		uh
 		well i mean in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DC</ENAMEX> there's a law uh that was recently passed that like um
 		you have to  it's a law i think that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>
 		have to provide recycling i guess recycling bins they have to recycle it's a law to do it
 	
 	
 		yeah they just they just did the same thing up here uh the whole county built a uh uh <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">incinerator</ENAMEX> actually <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two thirds</NUMEX> of the county built it
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and they also of course they had to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York State EEC</ENAMEX> the environmental <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> mandate that you have to recycle things so anybody who wants funding or doesn't want their landfills closed and sued
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		has to uh recycle
 	
 	
 		it's like um i mean personally i've never been a recycling <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">nut</ENAMEX> in terms of like i don't i don't go out of my way and i think like they put uh receptacles around <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">campus</ENAMEX> and the dorms and that makes me
 		um  more apt to do it because it's there it's more convenient
 		right
 	
 	
 		yeah a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> up here the exact same way you know they won't lift a finger
 		and uh it hasn't gotten around here that you know you go to any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX> or something and there is a trash can there isn't a bin for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glass</ENAMEX> a bin for
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		it's it's really just on the verge it it hasn't quite happened yet but that you know i was on vacation a couple places uh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">uh Utah</ENAMEX> had some bins
 	
 	
 		yeah i mean i'm looking right here there's a waste bin  for waste i don't know i guess they recycle i guess they can recycle
 		normal waste i'm not really sure and there's trash cans too i mean generally when i'm right when i if i go by the waste bin i'll put something in there if it fits  they've got cans and bottles um and bins for paper
 	
 	
 		
 
 		so you wouldn't walk around for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a long time</TIMEX> with a can in your hand because you couldn't found a uh a bin for it
 	
 	
 		no
 		no not really i mean
 	
 	
 		
 
 		toss it in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> place that it  that you could find
 	
 	
 		yeah i mean like the right now i'm in uh our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> center studying and i'll go out of my i'll walk up get up from my table and walk out of my way i mean well they're right near the trash can so i'll i'll toss it in the bin but um
 		as far as if i'm walking in the street drinking a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">soda</ENAMEX> and i finish it i'm going to toss it in the nearest trash can probably
 		i mean it's convenient it's it's there if the the recycling bin is not there i'm probably i'm if it was there i'd use it
 	
 	
 		right well i think well maybe that's a good way to uh promote recycling is just to make it more available
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		exactly i mean even in my in my dorm it's in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">basement</ENAMEX> but i pile it i let i let them pile up in the trash in my uh in the garbage in um a giant bag a a shopping bag and then uh take it down in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">basement</ENAMEX> and toss it in the uh recycling trash can
 		um but yeah i mean more receptacles uh around on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> even would would um make <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> do it
 		i mean if it's there they're going to do it still i mean some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> won't even go that far out of their way
 		there are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who are pretty ignorant and i mean or are really set in their ways
 	
 	
 		yeah i guess you know my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mom</ENAMEX> she always recycled everything
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so i'm use to it but
 		if i was use to just throwing things away it would be a really tough habit to unlearn
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so maybe you know the next generation will be a little bit more uh conscientious than we are
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm sure they will i mean with uh the way things are going i mean uh it's going towards a more green
 		type of thing
 		green thinking should call it
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> more aware
 		more aware they need to save the environment and all that
 	
 	
 		course you are on a college <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">campus</ENAMEX> where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are more aware than the general public
 	
 	
 		right
 		oh definitely i mean there's been plenty of uh up roar about the uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marriott</ENAMEX> using um styrofoam cups and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">styrofoam plates</ENAMEX> and that kind of thing
 	
 	
 		
 
 		now now that's really tough because you read stuff and you can't tell whether a styrofoam plate is actually more or less wasteful than a paper one or some other plastic
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		cause i mean yeah the paper ones are have plastic coated and they're probably even worse i don't really know
 	
 	
 		yeah who knows what's not
 	
 	
 		harder to recycle
 	
 	
 		and uh you know if you put them in a landfill they take up the same amount of space
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> doesn't break down either
 	
 	
 		well i think it's possible to recycle styrofoam but it's more expensive
 		um
 		they do have reusable cups that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> can uh i mean basically you've got carry around this cup if you want to if you want to be uh environmentally um conscious
 		and they i believe they give discounts on on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drinks</ENAMEX> if you have this cup so that's kind of incentive
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you have a discount on your on your on your <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drink</ENAMEX> instead of the regular price or whatever
 	
 	
 		well that that's good i mean God forbid you should actually you know have a cup and then wash it out once and a while and reuse it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right
 	
 	
 		yeah like
 		imagine that
