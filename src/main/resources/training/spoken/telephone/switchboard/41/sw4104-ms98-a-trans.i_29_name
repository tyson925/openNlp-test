 
     		
 	
 		anyway uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		how about you what do you do with your budget
 	
 	
 		what do i do um at the moment it's utter chaos  um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		right now i'm just uh i i don't really have a budget per se i'm i uh
 		it's called living within your means
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know which means at the moment um paying off the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Visa</ENAMEX> bill and keeping everything else under control
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and hoping the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> doesn't collapse
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true
 	
 	
 		um but uh no i don't really have a budget at the moment um
 		but i have uh i have uh rough feel for how much money i can afford to spend <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each month</TIMEX> and then i don't  usually don't exceed that unless i unless the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Visa</ENAMEX> bill gets out of hand for one reason or another like if i have car expenses and then that
 		that then it goes through the moon so
 	
 	
 		yeah that sort of a problem
 	
 	
 		yeah so um
 		what'd you
 	
 	
 		we're trying we're trying
 		to um
 		so far we are in the clear credit wise but uh the other side of it is
 		so
 		not much on that side of it  to add to it we're trying to think of how to put away some savings
 		and stuff like that but
 	
 	
 		so you can afford to get a house
 	
 	
 		yeah we'd like to do that some day we have this dream
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yes
 	
 	
 		but we don't know how long it will be a dream
 		we we're kind of real we're really happy that we don't have any debt
 		but we're at the same time we're real scared about incurring it in this um
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">economy</ENAMEX> right now so we're stepping real careful and trying to see what's the best way to save what the little bit that we do get you know on top of expenses <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every month</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		so what do you and your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> do
 	
 	
 		we're <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">missionaries</ENAMEX> actually yeah uh-huh
 	
 	
 		are you really
 	
 	
 		and um it will be easier once we get overseas cause we have uh like uh uh support quota
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		and it's cheaper to live overseas than it is to live here
 	
 	
 		no kidding
 	
 	
 		and it doesn't get switched very easily once you come home
 	
 	
 		i see so overseas where would you be going
 	
 	
 		so
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Africa Nigeria</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		really how long would you be there
 	
 	
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about four years</TIMEX> we're career so we we go over seas for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four years</TIMEX> and then we come back for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> we go over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four</TIMEX> we come back for a year
 	
 	
 		with with what church
 	
 	
 		um we're with <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Wycliffe Bible</ENAMEX> Translators
 	
 	
 		oh yes yes i uh know who they are they um they have an office uh in in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Costa Mesa</ENAMEX> as i recall
 	
 	
 		so
 		yeah they could very well and
 	
 	
 		there there was uh you know there was a fairly large <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> that that was  so um are you uh are you uh active in translation
 	
 	
 		um we will be i was over over for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four years</TIMEX> doing language surveying which is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step you're kind of like the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scout</ENAMEX> that goes ahead of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> and assesses the need and uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		came home and got married and we will go back back as translators cause we want to raise a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> and it is easier to raise a family
 		as translators well i always wanted to do translation
 		but as long as i was single and footloose so to speak it's easier you know they really need surveyors cause you could
 		you're free to travel anywhere you don't have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> hanging around you and stuff
 	
 	
 		true enough so um what uh what languages do you speak besides <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> of course
 	
 	
 		well i have a smattering of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about ten</NUMEX> different ones but there's i'm not bilingual in any of them because i kept switching from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> area to the other you know since i did
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know complete a survey in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> area i'd switch to the other so i know the greetings in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about ten</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and how to do market stuff but in about
 		um <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about five</NUMEX> i guess i can do better in it and my <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">French</ENAMEX> is pretty good but it's uh <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Senegalese French</ENAMEX> so uh i'm terrified to speak it in um
 	
 	
 		in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> yeah because they're real snobby about their language and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Senegalese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">French</ENAMEX> is street <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> and
 		i just picked it up off the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> and i knew what i was i knew what i was communicating but i didn't know what i was saying i never sat there and got a direct translation and
 		said something here when i came home and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> to somebody and he paled and said i'm not going to tell you what you said so
 		since then i have refrained from speaking any <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX>  except in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Senegal</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um
 	
 	
 		i don't know what i said to him but uh i didn't ask him either
 	
 	
 		must have been terrible
 		the um
 		was it <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Macon</ENAMEX> said that the
 		the uh language is like a is like a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> slowly bleeding to death slowly hemorrhaging to death without new infusions that will eventually die
 		and i it it just amazes me that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> don't recognize that free style <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> is just
 		takes on new
