 
     		
 	
 		so uh how do you feel about the taxes you pay do you feel you pay uh too much or
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about</NUMEX> right or
 	
 	
 		well it it it's the type of thing of what exactly am i getting out of the taxes and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		to some extent there is definitely
 		you know you can say all right i'm paying this money for this and this is what i'm getting back in terms of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">highways</ENAMEX> and you know i guess quote unquote retirement if it's actually there when we actually end up retiring
 	
 	
 		yeah it's hard to tell
 	
 	
 		there there seems to be some problem you know some question on whether there will be actually money there or not
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		that i don't like about the taxes is i was looking through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> forms like uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the other day</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i noticed that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fourteen</NUMEX> percent of the amount of money that we pay in for taxes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</TIMEX> is just going to pay the national debt
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		now is that the debt uh  or is that just the interest on the debt
 	
 	
 		that that is the interest on the debt
 	
 	
 		yes you know i really don't understand this completely i've been a little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mystified</ENAMEX> who who are we paying it to
 	
 	
 		ourselves
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		um to a large extent i mean one of the i think i'm not sure if it's the largest but i know a large segment of the national debt is um you know things like savings bonds and other government obligations
 	
 	
 		okay so it's to private <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> who own <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> instruments of some sort
 	
 	
 		well not not just private but there's you know lot of public <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX> that are holding money as well as a lot of um foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> and foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		that are holding that but
 	
 	
 		okay so but these are nongovernmental entities
 	
 	
 		yeah nongovernmental
 	
 	
 		okay who are holding bonds and whatever
 	
 	
 		yeah you know <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> Certificates and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> Savings Bonds and whatever
 	
 	
 		okay
 		yeah that is uh i mean well what what can they i mean
 		what's to be done at this point increase that amount for sometime so it will eventually go down or i mean i imagine if you're just servicing the debt you're not really making any progress right
 	
 	
 		right well it's actually uh you know also looking at the same form they had that we are borrowing the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> is borrowing eighteen percent of the amount of of how how of whatever it's spending <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every year</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		so we're increasing the debt by an amount equal to eighteen percent of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> budget
 	
 	
 		yeah so we're borrowing eighteen percent and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fourteen</NUMEX> percent of what we're paying out is going to pay the eighteen the uh debt so to some extent we're borrowing money to pay
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		you know fourteen percent that we're borrowing goes directly paying out to the debt
 	
 	
 		which is only increasing
 	
 	
 		yeah so we're you know net we're doing a net borrowing of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">four percent</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</TIMEX> and then we're doing a borrowing on top of that of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fourteen</NUMEX> percent that just goes to pay interest on the debt
 	
 	
 		right and uh
 		then the question i mean do other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> do this or this a distinctly <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> phenomenon
 	
 	
 		that i don't know i don't know if uh other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> work as a deficit or not i from what i can understand it's only recent within maybe the last <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fifty years</TIMEX> or so
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know except for wartimes that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U S</ENAMEX> has had a peacetime debt
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		well and i guess <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fifty years</TIMEX> would pretty much jive with the last big wartime debt
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and they just seemed like it's a good idea why stop
 	
 	
 		yeah i i think if you look at some of the uh government spending curves um you know the the curve always went up around wartime and then dropped back down
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		after <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War</ENAMEX> Two it never dropped back down or it was <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> or uh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Korea</ENAMEX> i think it never dropped back down
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		so what do you think is the uh
 		you know if you were in charge what would you
 		what parts would you change to fix this problem
 	
 	
 		well you know definitely one thing is to say hey we have a year to year balanced budget
 	
 	
 		so at least we wouldn't have that additional uh
 		what was it eighteen percent or yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah so you know you know maybe raise taxes for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few years</TIMEX> until that debt gets paid off and then say you know unless there is a
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		tremendously bad circumstances like a war or something we should not be running a deficit economy
 		you know that's i mean if you look on the individual level if i were to borrow eighteen percent of what i was spending <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every year year after year</TIMEX> i would very quickly get in trouble with creditors
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 		well it does seem like the uh the quality of the bonds that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> sell would eventually be downgraded doesn't it
 	
 	
 		um yeah well that's you know the post wartime <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> they just kept printing up money and you know it became worthless so that's one danger
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but you know it's that that's a very large chunk of
 		the money we pay in for taxes each year
 	
 	
 		it is shocking but apparently no one's willing to
 		oh i'm not no one but by the time it all ends up in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> seems
