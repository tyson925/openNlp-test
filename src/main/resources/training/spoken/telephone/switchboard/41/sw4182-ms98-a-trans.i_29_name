 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay um so we're talking about drug testing on and how we feel about it in in in the work place
 	
 	
 		correct i i assume this is involuntary drug testing from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employers</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah my my gut feeling is to
 		probably side uh on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">the Bill of Rights</ENAMEX> side of this and say that this it's an unfair  invasion of privacy i i um
 		it i have to say that i
 		my from my political point of view
 		i tend to be i tend to sort of fall in the liberal side of a lot of issues but at the same time uh part of my own picture of the way  politics should work in this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> is there also should be
 		uh regulatory controls on things and i think that when you have situations where uh an uh a working individual uh could do damage for instance a an airline pilot
 		uh you know or or somebody who's driving a public <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carrier</ENAMEX> like like <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">truck</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drivers</ENAMEX> and stuff like that i think that there is a uh far more substantial issue
 		uh at hand but i think there other ways um other than than doing things like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> testing to monitor the way um <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> behave um i think a good for instance a good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> should be able to tell that somebody's got a personal problem um
 		in in like a clerical environment or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a</NUMEX> a work environment like i'm a i'm a computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">programmer</ENAMEX> so  if i were indulging in activities like that or one of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> were um
 		it would seem to me pretty easy to to tell if their performance was suffering for it
 		i don't know how do you feel about these things
 	
 	
 		right
 		well i i i i tend to look at it like uh right i mean without without uh you know a suspicion of of you know reasonable suspicion of of something going on i i would have to probably tend to uh
 		uh agree that at least in most cases it should not be done i i also my my big question of course is you know this is a pretty steep thing for uh something the last i heard was not <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred</NUMEX> percent effective
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		or you know accurate uh with it not being <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred</NUMEX> percent accurate that that leaves open you know quite a bit of room for you know false positive
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		sure sure and that could ruin somebody's life
 	
 	
 		uh
 		absolutely you know that that
 	
 	
 		even if they were vindicated
 	
 	
 		sure sure because i mean it's like uh someone goes on trial for something
 		the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">press</ENAMEX> lets everybody know so no matter how many times you're acquitted
 		but uh so there is that i mean but also you know as as someone who does not use any controlled substances i
 		you know part of me says well as long as it's accurate i don't care if they test and if someone is using it they should be you know caught for it as long as it's illegal
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		uh so that you know that that is a tough things to juggle between the two
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		well i have to say i'm i'm a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixties</TIMEX> and uh it it you know i grew up and when i was young i flirted around with some of that stuff like a lot of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> did and i saw a lot of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> ruin their lives or not not really
 		i don't know i guess i saw a couple of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> ruin their lives and that sort of thing but i didn't see most of them ruin their lives with it in fact most of them went through it like a phase like
 		you know most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teenagers</ENAMEX> will drink for a little while and then when they you know have to start you know working and that sort of thing they tend to cut it back to drinking on the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekends</TIMEX> or whatever
 		and and they become <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> about it
 		and uh in in fact my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attitudes</ENAMEX> about the kinds of drug problems that we have in this country
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> are are that i think that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> should administrate administrate it in a completely you know in a completely different manner i think it would be a
 		a good source of revenue i think there's some some evidence about the way this stuff has been handled in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> that shows that it can be controlled in different ways but that's sort of moving off the topic at hand here and i you know the the
 		fact of the matter is is i think that issues like this really
 		really are i mean to a certain extent they involve the whole question of liberty and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>'s right to privacy and that sort of thing because uh uh you know i mean
 	
 	
 		it also involves due process
 	
 	
 		yeah and and uh it it i you know the fact of the matter is is i think that that an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult</ENAMEX> responsible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX> doesn't want to
 		have this kind of thing in his life if it's going to impact uh have an impact upon his ability to make a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a</NUMEX> a living and and you know and and keep his livelihood coming in
 	
 	
 		and and that does bring up a good point in that if it's not having an impact then what right does the uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employer</ENAMEX> have to
 		you know to get information about that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">sure and and</ENAMEX> and uh and and so you know it's uh i so anyway i guess that we're we're largely in agreement in that uh
 		case and uh and in fact i think that uh because you know i mean i it's it's literally i you know i'm in my late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirties now</TIMEX> and it's easily been um almost
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">jeez</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> maybe <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty years</TIMEX> almost since i last had any of that that sort of stuff uh around me but at the same time i don't think that that necessarily gives me a right to say
