 
     		
 	
 		i got a budget that i worked out on a spreadsheet that i keep on my home computer the only thing is that i kind of drifted away from it originally when i set it up
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		um i'd started back to school and had all these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">grand</ENAMEX> plans and sat down and figured out everything to the penny all the way down to haircuts every little thing i could imagine spending money on
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and got it all set up and then kind of got tuned to it and for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about a year or so</TIMEX> i kept real good track of bills and made sure things fit into it but i got to the point where my spending habits pretty much stabilized and i just knew what they were
 		i don't think i've looked at that thing in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> and a half
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh i wish i could say that we did the same in terms of our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> uh it we have considered it from time to time
 		and the problem that i always got into was the hassle of keeping track of all the data and then deciding basically what we was going to do about it
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		because to me the need for a budget is especially when money's tight and i'm happy to say that money's not too tight we just kind of drift along
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh we've gotten into troubles recently while the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last couple of years</TIMEX> we're all of a suddenly uh it's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> time and we look and say ooh we owe a lot of money
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but we've even recovered from that and so i guess our budget is mostly in our head
 	
 	
 		yeah keeping it keeping all the records and all that stuff is a pretty high maintenance thing takes some dedication to really sit down and do it but it definitely does pay off if you keep track of things keep a good grip on it
 	
 	
 		how does it pay off for you
 	
 	
 		well by seeing the flow and stuff like that i can see where there's a lot of
 		uh frivolous frivolous waste too much uh going out things like that that really i can do without those kind of things
 		it's hard to um to just go out and keep a day to day balance of stuff
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		reminds me <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX> i had trouble quitting biting my nails and i read some uh suggestion that said well you know if you keep them all and tape on a piece of paper and see how many you know nails you're biting off you'll be amazed
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> that that ended it in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about a week</TIMEX> um
 	
 	
 		
 
 		and the same thing for the budget huh
 	
 	
 		yeah very similar procedure
 	
 	
 		interesting i i just got a lecture <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> from my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> about being frivolous she wants me to be more frivolous
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and so i guess my thought there is uh not to uh not to look at it and say oh my goodness i'm not allowed to do this on the other hand uh i think i'm ready to elect you to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> uh
 		uh in terms of actually considering a budget
 		
 
 		and staying with it
 	
 	
 		really that has got to be one of the worst problems we've got here today
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right
 	
 	
 		and it's hardly considered you know here it is uh a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">an election election year</TIMEX> and you hardly hear anything about it
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		especially the deficit this massive looming black cloud waiting to break out on us
 	
 	
 		yep
 		and so i think we as a society tend to have
 		uh at least now kind of uh well budget who needs a budget i mean we're having fun
 	
 	
 		yeah yep
 	
 	
 		and so i guess i'm kind of midway between the the party <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party party</ENAMEX> side and the uh uh oh my goodness we got to look at every <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">last cent</TIMEX>
 		actually your story reminds me of uh when back in college uh i had overspent my budget which was kind of haphazardly kept but it became very obvious when i had something like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty eight</TIMEX> dollars left for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the month of February</TIMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> and it got very obvious as to what i was going to do uh and some of that included eating
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um yep
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh i it was called subsist on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peanut butter</ENAMEX> and jelly for the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the month</TIMEX> and at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> point some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> in a sorority that i knew uh that i hung out at felt sorry for me and took me in the back <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> and fed me a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salad</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">colleges</ENAMEX> and education in many ways
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		you bet you bet i think the reason why they did was they were afraid that somebody else was going to win the pool on whether i was going to die of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">berry berry</ENAMEX> or some sort of  disease like that
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i haven't resorted to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">um peanut butter</ENAMEX> but i have had to go to long periods of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ragu</ENAMEX> and um pasta
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well at least you're not down to <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> food
 	
 	
 		ooh ooh actually we've got a stash of that we had a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> but it ran away
 	
 	
 		uh
 		oh no
 	
 	
 		um so we've got a good bit
 		we've got a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> now and it'll eat the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> food though that's its treat at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the end of the day</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		sounds like a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> with a complex
 	
 	
 		well he's a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">puppy</ENAMEX> i don't thing he really knows knows too much of uh the difference yet
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh great
 	
 	
 		it's good food fortunately that's cheap and it fits in the budget twenty <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">five cents</NUMEX> a can
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah right right well as long as you're not teaching him how to meow or something like that
 	
 	
 		well i've been trying to teach him to sing lately yeah that's uh it hasn't been real successful but he barks real well
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">uh</ENAMEX> reminds reminds me of that old adage never teach a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pig</ENAMEX> to sing
 		the results can be really terrible and besides it annoys the pig
 	
 	
 		uh
