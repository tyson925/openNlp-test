 
     		
 	
 		so do you do any
 	
 	
 		well it's kind of i do when i don't uh
 		i go i go in spurts unfortunately i can't get as as regular and dedicated as as i probably should
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah well it's it's hard to get uh it's hard to maintain a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">a real</NUMEX> level of uh
 		i don't know what you'd call it i guess motivation at least for me it is i mean
 	
 	
 		where where you where you are you'd probably have to you know the weather probably doesn't cooperate with you you so you would have to belong to a gym or something and
 	
 	
 		yeah i actually i lift weights pretty regular <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">now</TIMEX> and i've done it for the last oh i don't know ten twelve years
 		so it works pretty well for me but still it's like you say the motivation is not always there especially in the cold weather
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		and i'm not real used to the cold up here anyway just because i'm from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> really
 	
 	
 		oh gosh  that was a shock i bet
 	
 	
 		so
 		yeah a bit a bit so uh but i don't know it's it's good to get it you get that good feeling you know when you get done and and you're glad you did it i guess but um
 	
 	
 		well growing up i was always um
 		fairly athletic and always um
 		you know i didn't really have to
 		think about an exercise routine because i was always doing something that more or less required exercise
 	
 	
 		right
 		sure
 	
 	
 		but um i've been in a job lately where i've been working <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">some really long hours</TIMEX> and some <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">nights</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekends</TIMEX> and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		that makes it rough because then
 	
 	
 		it makes you you lose every bit of  muscle tone you ever thought about having and then to try to work your way back from that is  is why i can't really get
 	
 	
 		sure
 		yeah that's
 	
 	
 		i'll start up and i'll do pretty religiously and then i'll have to work till <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midnight one night</TIMEX> or something and then  you know
 	
 	
 		right and that just screws up your whole schedule
 	
 	
 		oops are you there oh i don't know what that was
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh wow you're sounding a lot clearer now
 	
 	
 		i think there's some wrong with the phone or something i think sometimes when they connect it up it it doesn't work right or or something's not exactly right
 	
 	
 		oh yeah that's pretty weird um but yeah i i don't know i i do a lot of stuff or i at least i have in the past done a lot of weird a lot of different activities
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">um</ENAMEX> and moving down here is is in a way kind of or moving up here is pretty bad because i can't do as much as i used to because the weather just doesn't permit it you know so
 	
 	
 		yeah sure
 		i mean like if your favorite thing is swimming  you'd have to join a you know a some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">club</ENAMEX> that has a pool and then you have to fight the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowds</ENAMEX> and that sort of thing
 	
 	
 		exactly and and it is you know i mean
 		exactly  it's just a hassle at time
 	
 	
 		everybody i know that belongs to a health <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">club</ENAMEX> here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> the better ones are always crowded at the times when you'd be more sure you know more likely to use it like right after work or
 	
 	
 		sure everybody gets off of work
 	
 	
 		you know during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">lunch hours</TIMEX> or you know right before work and that sort of thing so <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> end up exercising at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">really odd hours</TIMEX> and i can't exercise you know <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">late at night</TIMEX> because it keeps me awake
 	
 	
 		right
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		sure
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		i mean you know once you
 		you know i've got i bought myself a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of these little um they call it a cross <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trainer</ENAMEX> or something like that it's got um
 	
 	
 		kind of like a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Soloflex</ENAMEX> or something
 	
 	
 		yeah it's got uh and it's got a stair climber and it's got the the kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bench</ENAMEX> and you can do the leg lifting things and the the bench press thing and it's got a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">butterfly</ENAMEX> thing and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		oh that's good
 	
 	
 		you know it's got a lot of different stuff on it and i mainly got it because you know like i say since i've gotten so out of shape and everything i forget and i'll do something
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		not thinking about that i don't have the muscle to do it anymore and i injured my rotator cuff on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> really badly and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> was kind of like well you know you're gonna have to
 	
 	
 		uh
 		right
 		uh oh
 		learn to take it easy
 	
 	
 		get some yeah get some build up some muscle tone in in your upper <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX> or it's gonna always be a problem and it might have to be operated on and you know all this kind of stuff so
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know i i got this machine to try to because i i one thing i did kind of keep up doing was i like to walk
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i like to ride my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bicycle</ENAMEX> so when the weather's okay you know i can do that but um you know having to
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		do something for the shoulder or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> or something i i had to get a machine to do that and so i have it in my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> because i know if i had to get <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> from work change clothes and go somewhere to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">club</ENAMEX> i just wouldn't do it
 	
 	
 		right uh-huh
 		right yeah it it'd be too much of a hassle
 	
 	
 		and when when you're working really hard and you come in the door you don't wanna turn around and go back out again  i mean i have enough trouble you know just doing i do a lot of volunteer work and
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		oh you do
 	
 	
 		and some stuff like that it it's all i can do just to force myself to turn around and go back out and do that kind of stuff
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so you know
