 
     		
 	
 		recording
 	
 	
 		so what kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> do you have
 	
 	
 		well i have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		i have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> because i can't have dogs um where i live i i've wanted a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> i owned a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> we had dogs when i was growing up all the time
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and um you know our our <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> are are very interesting and we never owned <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> when i was growing up so this is a
 		uh it's been a really really neat uh neat kind of learning experience for me they've blown all my uh conceptions preconceptions about <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so do you do you have pets
 	
 	
 		yeah i have a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">uh-oh</ENAMEX> do they get along
 	
 	
 		so oh yeah they it was uh a very hairy <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks</TIMEX> there at the beginning uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> was a little under a year and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about six weeks old</TIMEX> and it it was a hefty break in
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh did the dog the dog like uh know that there was a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		well it was very it was interesting because it it's just you know part of their makeup they're psyche i mean they just hate each other automatically but after a while they they got to be good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> and uh
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		luckily it's sort of a big <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> i mean it's <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about twelve pounds</NUMEX> and uh so he can hold his own against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> and uh but they they i basically got the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> to keep the dog <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> and uh they they do that
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		
 
 		yeah that's that's actually why we got our <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> i we thought our <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> needed a pet
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh you know you tend to personify these things but our our <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> thinks our oldest <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> thinks that it it should be a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> and our youngest <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> actually thinks it's a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so it works out pretty well um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well i'll tell you one thing i found with with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pets um</ENAMEX> i i think cats
 		are easier to take care of especially when on a situation like you go off on a trip uh you know it's a real pain with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> because you have to have someone come over and walk them and let them out and that kind of thing
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 		feed them and all that
 	
 	
 		and sometimes i think wow if i had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> i'd just you know get a feeder  and
 	
 	
 		uh yeah you know an interesting story is i i i have a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> who has um a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> that actually knows how to open <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tender Vittles</ENAMEX> bags
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so if they go on a trip they just leave the bags on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen floor</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>'ll go and open one when it wants to eat
 	
 	
 		oh that's amazing
 	
 	
 		i'm i swear to God it's like you know the i guess uh it earlier uh earlier time it would have to figure out how to use a can opener but you know now it it's pretty self sufficient i just think
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you they say you own a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> and you feed a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> and i think that that's pretty much pretty much true
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 		that is interesting i hadn't ever heard anything like that but uh
 	
 	
 		yeah i it blew me away
 	
 	
 		yeah we've been uh we've been pretty lucky too the uh reason we <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> got the dog to begin with was i lived i'm in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> still and i lived uh closer to campus
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh as usual the neighborhoods right near <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">campus</ENAMEX> aren't that nice
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh so we got the dog as protection and i guess it worked because we were never broken into and the but the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> on either side of us were  so yeah uh
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		uh we we usually had rifle cleaning <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> on the front porch when you know you move into a bad neighborhood you have your have all your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> over play the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grateful Dead</ENAMEX> and clean your <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">rifles</ENAMEX> and they pretty much get the idea
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh but the dog i guess would work too
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well it is a big dog
 	
 	
 		uh she's uh around <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fifty</NUMEX> pounds she's a a very very skinny shepherd
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		uh well she's not pure and
 		we we tried to figure out what she was crossed with we know the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> was a shepherd but uh she looks like she's crossed with like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Greyhound</ENAMEX> because she is just thin as a rail and uh
 	
 	
 		oh
 		wow well see they they say that the uh mixed breeds have a better temperament anyway all that inbreeding that they do that they have to do to maintain a pure <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> line i guess makes them really weird
 	
 	
 		yeah definitely and they're also prone to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more</NUMEX> diseases and uh skin problems and
 		my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> has a a pure bred gold uh yellow <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lab</ENAMEX> and that <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> has every problem you could imagine you know it's allergic to <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fleas</ENAMEX> it's uh got another skin <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">condition</ENAMEX> and just
 	
 	
 		
 
 		the dreaded hip dysplasia
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah that's uh
 	
 	
 		so we we haven't really had much problems with her she's uh just extremely hyper and uh i guess that accounts for her her physique and she runs like a gazelle so
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it's fun to take her to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> and watch her run rings around all the other dogs
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		trying to play with them and they look at her like you're crazy you think i'm going to catch you
 	
 	
 		she's
 		maybe she is part Greyhound huh
 	
 	
 		so yeah yeah either
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that's that's uh that's interesting i thought about for a while there uh there's a  a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">movement</ENAMEX> now to uh adopt ex-race <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		right
