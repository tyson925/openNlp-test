 		well why did your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">roommate</ENAMEX> get a dog
 	
 	
 		i really don't know he kind of moved out entirely and um
 		was living with his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girlfriend</ENAMEX> in this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> and they had gone ahead and gotten this <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Rottweiler puppy</ENAMEX>
 		and next thing i knew well he went ahead and kept uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> here kept paying for it after he graduated and next thing i knew they had kicked the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rottweiler</ENAMEX> out so he came back home with it
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		we've got a big <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">yard</ENAMEX> here and he can run around out there but he's pretty rough i'm getting a lot of scars on my hands
 	
 	
 		oh that's good
 		
 
 	
 	
 		arms and stuff
 	
 	
 		well is he teething
 	
 	
 		yeah and it's it's getting kind of rough in fact he'll even chew on your face if you make the right kind of noise
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh yuck oh yuck well i have a um i have a well i call her my a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">puppy</ENAMEX> but she's actually going to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and uh had her <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all ten years</TIMEX> and she she'll rough <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> with you but she's she's learned very quickly when enough is enough
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but she loves to play and stuff but i don't know she's she's i'm getting ready to i'm fixing to move out in on my own
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and she's going with me and i mean that's i i'm thinking that she's going to be one of my main <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of of companionship in in the beginning
 	
 	
 		do you um think about her as defensive kind of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">maybe</NUMEX> tool or something
 	
 	
 		you mean a  as far as protection house protection
 	
 	
 		nah protecting you and the house
 	
 	
 		oh no no no she had a stroke <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about two years ago</TIMEX> she's blind
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		so no no she she's strictly the lovable type
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so no she's she's too little to do that
 	
 	
 		i live downtown and the neighborhood's pretty and i like the um the idea of having a a good mean strong dog around we've had some in the past and it's really paid off i
 	
 	
 		so this is this is not your first experience with  with a dog
 	
 	
 		no no we've had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> other ones here at this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and the last <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> was well the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> said it was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> wolf and it really had that look yellow eyes
 		it was very intelligent but there was <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> if it got the chance it wouldn't leave anything alive in the area
 	
 	
 		whoa
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> and squirrels and stuff like that i can remember going for a jog <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX> with it and it got hold of a baby squirrel
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and you know there really wasn't a whole lot that could be done other than let it go ahead and finish it off at that point
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um um</ENAMEX>
 		well uh let's see a lot of the uh i don't know if you've i've i've been i've heard about a lot of studies and stuff
 		and they said that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">um people</ENAMEX> that have <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pets</ENAMEX> have a lower incidence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">um heart disease</ENAMEX> and stuff like that
 	
 	
 		yeah i believe that and i believe it
 	
 	
 		yeah you take out all your aggressions on the dog
 	
 	
 		
 
 		and plus having something to care for and somebody that cares for you
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		they're they're good companions absolutely
 	
 	
 		it's a lot better than coming home to an empty house
 	
 	
 		yeah what what do they call that unconditional um
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		uh that kind of love where there's just no expectations or anything like that
 	
 	
 		oh yeah yeah i i know what you're talking about yeah
 	
 	
 		totally undevoted totally devoted uh
 	
 	
 		yeah totally i mean because i mean they know no other
 		no other kind
 	
 	
 		yeah i used to have a chicken i only had it for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few months</TIMEX> though and one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> around here got a hold of it
 	
 	
 		a chicken
 	
 	
 		and see the when i moved in here the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> had <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">chickens</ENAMEX> and even though this is downtown they had a rooster over there and it woke me up <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">every morning</TIMEX> a little bit after sunrise
 		and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">uncle</ENAMEX> found this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chicken</ENAMEX> in his neighborhood and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one night</TIMEX> when it roosted nearby he went ahead and grabbed it and asked if i wanted it and brought it on over
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ethel</ENAMEX> a little black bantam
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ethel</ENAMEX> that's cute did did she do eggs i mean did you did you did she lay <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX> and stuff
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh she didn't hang around long enough tried trimming her wings but she kept getting out
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		i'm not really sure what happened to her
 	
 	
 		gosh yeah the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chicken</ENAMEX> that got loose in the city
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 		so
 	
 	
 		we had a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> recently too but it decided that it just didn't like staying inside all the time it kept wanting out so i'd go ahead and let it out and it got till it got more and more feral
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and next thing i knew <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> it'd gotten till it really smelled of the outside
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it had found some horrible smell that it liked and when it would come in you couldn't couldn't stand being near it
 		and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX> it went ahead and marked the couches in the living <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> at that point i went ahead and banished it and that was it no more <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well is is is your Rottweiler mainly an indoor <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> or an outdoor dog
 	
 	
 		well we're trying to get her to be more and more of an outdoor dog right now she's indoors she's still a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">puppy</ENAMEX> and needs a lot of social interaction
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		so you come home and she's dying to come in barks at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> howls lonely
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so we go and let her in
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		well and that's it was i know growing up i had i had several <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> that were outside
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pooh Bear</ENAMEX> is inside is an inside dog but and and i found that it's so much easier to socialize with her because she's inside and i can do other things with her there
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		whereas i don't have to go outside to play with her you know what i'm saying
 	
 	
 		yeah
