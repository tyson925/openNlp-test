 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
 
 		so what do you think about uh the recycling programs in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Atlanta Julie</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i don't believe that we're
 		the recycling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">program</ENAMEX> here is just terrible i mean it's hard to find places to go i mean <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kroger</ENAMEX> does a couple things they i don't think they do they do newspapers
 	
 	
 		i don't know there's there's big bins out there i don't know if they ever get
 		i i really don't know what the details are there should be someplace where you could call and find out as a matter of fact i'm pretty sure there's a place you can call and find out the closest you know
 		thing to you but
 		i think there should be some kind of curbside service that's the only way i could really
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> is so cool because they pick up everything they pick up <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX> and uh you know milk jugs and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aluminum</ENAMEX> and tin cans you know like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">soup</ENAMEX> comes in and stuff
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		they pick up everything
 	
 	
 		during the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summers</TIMEX> like the
 		around where i live the uh
 		homeless <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> seem i mean they all have like shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">carts</ENAMEX> and stuff and they'll go around and collect cans and aluminum stuff and so we used to just save them up and then they'd come around and we'd give them to them
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but when during the winter time i think they they move south or something so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i don't do that anymore and the the recycling at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Georgia Tech</ENAMEX> like that um outside the uh student center
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		they never empty those things
 	
 	
 		i know it i know it it piles up
 	
 	
 		they just overflow
 		so what's a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> to do
 		you know
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i just don't know
 	
 	
 		i asked myself
 	
 	
 		i just don't know and now they have like bins and stuff that are a little more convenient because mean until <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">seven o'clock</TIMEX> you got to pay to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> at the student center you can't really unload all your stuff
 	
 	
 		
 
 		really
 		huh well i you know it's true hadn't thought about that
 		that is very unconvenient inconvenient even
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i know it i know
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		so you do recycle don't you
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm kind of i'm kind of bad about it
 	
 	
 		the
 	
 	
 		but if i if see a  if i see a pile of cans or bottles or something
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i'll throw it in there  but i don't really i don't ever take anything
 	
 	
 		well i mean it's really  you ought to because the
 		the the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmer</ENAMEX>'s market recycles absolutely everything
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and since we go there all the time i mean
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		probably
 		be at all
 	
 	
 		but wait i've never seen you before  who are you
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh by the way my name is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Julie</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah my name's Bill well
 	
 	
 		hi
 	
 	
 		hi
 	
 	
 		i'm from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Atlanta</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		me too
 	
 	
 		neat
 	
 	
 		crazy
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		um
 		well
 		is there anything else you'd like to share me about your recycling philosophy <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Julie</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i just think that everybody ought to do it
 	
 	
 		do they do like what what about like um what kind of plastic stuff can you recycle do you know
 	
 	
 		the only thing i know that you can recycle is milk jugs
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		what about like those grocery bags
 	
 	
 		oh yeah they have uh
 		uh
 		what i what i used to uh now that i don't go to the grocery <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX> much it's kind of moot but i used to just save up the ones that i got <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and then go and hand them to them the next time and use them over and over
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and but also most places i think like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Star</ENAMEX> does and i'm not sure if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kroger</ENAMEX> does or not but
 	
 	
 		they'll ask you whether you want bags or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> or plastic
 	
 	
 		yeah and they they have like little little boxes that you can put your old bags in
 	
 	
 		aha
 	
 	
 		can bring them in
 	
 	
 		those petroleum products are gonna kill us
 	
 	
 		i know it i know it
 	
 	
 		it's hostile planet i think <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Julie</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it  it really is a small hostile planet
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		the petroleum pretty much i mean those petroleum products i think are the big uh
 		you know
 	
 	
 		did you know that
 	
 	
 		the great <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Satan</ENAMEX> of the recycling
 	
 	
 		no really not  did you know that like something like fifty percent of the world's landfills is like paper
 		filled with paper
 	
 	
 		hm paper just seems so innocuous
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		paper doesn't seem threatening at all you know
 	
 	
 		well it is it is though
 	
 	
 		it comes from trees how can it be bad
 	
 	
 		it is because they
 	
 	
 		they treat it with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemicals</ENAMEX> or something
 		why can't <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> break down i don't get it
 	
 	
 		well
 		they do treat paper with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemicals</ENAMEX> like yellow paper you know
 	
 	
 		yep
 	
 	
 		takes something like  <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty</TIMEX> times as long to decompose you know you can bury a piece of yellow paper an it will still be there in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of weeks</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh
 		really
 	
 	
 		yeah it'll be whole
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		you'll be able to read off of it
 	
 	
 		i'm gonna switch from those yellow legal pads then
 	
 	
 		um hum
 	
 	
 		i'm glad you told me that because i use those at work where i work and uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but i can just forget that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">from now</TIMEX> on i'm going to use i'm going to switch to the white ones
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well white paper's bad too they they treat it too
 	
 	
 		well what about uh papyrus you know made out of bamboo you know bamboo stuff from the
 	
 	
 		i'm sure that's fine i'm sure
 	
 	
 		from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">the Nile</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		maybe we ought to just start carving in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">stone</ENAMEX> again
 	
 	
 		you think so
 	
 	
 		maybe
 	
 	
 		tablets
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i think we should just abandon the you know the written word altogether
 	
 	
 		you think
 		i don't know well i mean
 	
 	
 		no
 		what do you think
 	
 	
 		i think we've kind of you know i mean everybody everybody
 	
 	
 		kind of radical i know but
 	
 	
 		if everybody had a computer
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		we would no longer need paper at all
 	
 	
 		that's true
 		if everyone had a two-way wrist watch TV's on their wrist like uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dick Tracy</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i would love that
