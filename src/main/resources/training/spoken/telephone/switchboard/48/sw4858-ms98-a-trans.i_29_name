 
     		
 	
 		uh i'm of the age that could have gone although i didn't and uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i guess um looking back on it i tend to think it was pretty uh
 		mostly a mistake
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		on the other hand
 		um the more i learn about the history the more i see it was
 		incremental uh decisions anyone of which was sort of understandable at the time
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh but on the whole i think it uh probably was the wrong thing to do
 		how about you
 	
 	
 		well i'm uh
 		i i was just uh in high school  i guess when it when it ended ended up being i was in the last last lottery
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i was glad it was over by then i've never really totally understood what our purpose was over there just because you know we didn't really do anything when we went over it seems like
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know we um those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that i know i worked with several that were over there and
 		for some of them it was just kind of i don't know not so much a holiday i guess that's how they tend to talk about it
 		but that they just kind of lived out in the woods and every <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">now</TIMEX> and then they'd go and shoot their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">rifles</ENAMEX> and then they'd come back and you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but that they weren't really allowed to do anything i uh to me it seems like we only went halfway if even halfway
 	
 	
 		yes
 		
 
 		yeah it's funny tonight i was um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		helping my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX> with an essay on uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stalin</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i was thinking
 		in the course of talking to him about it how uh
 		in <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War</ENAMEX> Two the personalties of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stalin Hitler</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Churchill</ENAMEX>
 		more or less defined the war and actually when you think back on the big events of the war it was uh
 		it was almost a personal struggle among these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> uh i guess you'd have to call them great <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> in some sense  um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		they're certainly all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> and um and uh with their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nations</ENAMEX> pretty pretty solidly behind each <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of them
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i got a feeling that some of that was involved in the uh early decisions in the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Vietnam war</ENAMEX> that the uh  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> saw the cold war as uh you had to draw a line and and defend it
 		otherwise there'd be uh they'd get you someplace else
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		looking back it seems like that was only partly true that uh there might have been a better place to draw the line um
 		i guess you can
 		i guess you can say that a a certain amount of resolve and willingness to fight um
 		brought the cold war to an end but i don't think you can just fight anywhere just just in order to um call the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bully</ENAMEX> out and beat him
 		and i have a feeling that that's part of what was involved in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Vietnamese</ENAMEX> war they felt like this was a place where we could draw a line beat them and they wouldn't come forward and uh we were wrong
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but i um
 		you know the like how they said the more i hear about it
 		the more i can see each decision that was made as being understandable but the cumulative effect was to really get into a a hopeless situation
 		where and as you say uh going halfway was probably worse than um committing um committing to a completely and um winning it whatever that would mean
 	
 	
 		yeah well i i i think we did i think we did learn some lessons that we weren't uh
 		we weren't prepared for
 		i guess the best word is the atrocities of war
 	
 	
 		yeah  huh yeah
 	
 	
 		uh i mean the other wars seemed like a valiant war i mean they you know they seemed like a valiant thing you knew you knew who was good you knew who was bad and it was a it was a traditional
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		the traditional battle of kind of good versus evil if you you know whichever way it is but in in in the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Vietnam war</ENAMEX> it seems like it was
 	
 	
 		well you're not you're you're
 	
 	
 		the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sides</ENAMEX> and the lines that were drawn were all confused as to who's good and who's bad and
 	
 	
 		it's ambivalent yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh you know the even  it seems like even the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> you know had the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">South Vietnamese</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">North Vietnamese</ENAMEX> and
 		of course the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Laotians</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cambodians</ENAMEX> weren't even supposed to be involved but
 	
 	
 		what about what about the domestic effects like  i was thinking that maybe the most important effect it had was to make it
 		uh possible and even popular to um  criticize the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> and they that pendulum started to swing um maybe maybe even too far uh to the point where um
 		um supporting a government decision in foreign policy was sort of optional  from the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Vietnam war</ENAMEX> on and that tradition is still i mean it's dying now but it's still alive as opposed to
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Desert Storm</ENAMEX> stuff may have uh killed it but i think that was one of the biggest that you know the uh this domestic unrest that it
 	
 	
 		yeah
