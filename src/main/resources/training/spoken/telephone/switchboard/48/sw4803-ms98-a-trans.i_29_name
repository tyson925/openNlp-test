 
     		
 	
 		start it
 	
 	
 		
  
 		sure
 	
 	
 		okay uh basically i work for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> and our health insurance plan seems to be okay but it seems the benefits are are eroding and the cost of insurance goes up
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		uh i don't know why the post <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> post office <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> pay <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one third</NUMEX> out of their paycheck for the same insurance that we're getting
 		uh right now i'm in we're <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> health plan and that costs about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty five</TIMEX> bucks a paycheck
 		but yet the postal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> will only pay less than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> dollars a paycheck
 	
 	
 		it's called the union
 	
 	
 		
  
 		yes probably yes full payment one percent and i'm sure not everybody has they're probably getting their  worth and
 	
 	
 		
  
 		
  
 		
  
 		
  
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MasterCard</ENAMEX>'s cheaper too
 	
 	
 		well
 		
  
 		i am all for universal health insurance um being up here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> um
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		our local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blue Cross Blue Shield</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have
 		i'm i'm now paying <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every month</TIMEX> because i'm self-employed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one hundred and three</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">dollars</NUMEX> a month
 		for basic health care coverage
 		um actually i'm sorry it's more than that well it's <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">four hundred dollars</NUMEX> a quarter
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
  
 		so it's probably a little more than that
 	
 	
 		
  
 		gosh yeah that's a steep one
 	
 	
 		and
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
  
 		frankly i don't i think that if we can take what's been done in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> and given every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> a choice as far as who they want for their health care
 		frankly i think that the reason that we're in so much trouble and and and it's such an anticompetitive um
 		uh stance right now as far as doing battle with these other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> is that we are really burdening our <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporations</ENAMEX> with health care costs which they have to build in to the price of their product
 		whereas if you go to some one of these overseas countries <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> for example where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> pays all of that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		the you don't have to build that in to the cost of the product um they usually nail the product you know you pay as as an individual
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		versus um having a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> dragged down by these insane health care costs
 		and i think that we should have a health care system in this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> that everybody can get access to and uh have it universal
 		
  
 	
 	
 		i agree there because i you know <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> you're playing <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">baseball</ENAMEX> and you break your arm you don't know what it's going to cost you for the x-rays and everything else like that if you don't have some type of health plan that you can afford
 		and i'm sure there's a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that live paycheck to paycheck to where they cannot  and afford fifty bucks every paycheck for a health insurance plan
 		and i know i and when i was in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> i was in the service but at the same time there was an agreement that if you went to a hospital there in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> that they knew they could bill <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">uncle</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam</ENAMEX> for that hospital care
 		so they didn't give us any hassle  medical care there
 		and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> are over there and it's a great health insurance plan for them
 	
 	
 		
  
 		
  
 		
  
 		
  
 	
 	
 		i think that's going to cost us money as far as taxes if our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> gets into it because they all haven't shown a real good record for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> of any kind of program
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i you know i i wouldn't even mind so much if they had a um <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporation</ENAMEX> that is financed
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> or have some sort of there can be competition as long as there is a universal plan i don't oppose i do not i'm not for eliminating all private health insurance whatsoever
 		but um you know but if if you have the ability to pay
 		for that you can pay based on your income as a percentage
 		and uh more fairly and equitably distribute the cost across a wide spectrum right now
 		you know the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> working this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> is half the problem right there and we're seeing that's not a lot of it is private sector too
 		um i you know it's the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> is always attacked for not being able to do anything properly
 	
 	
 		
  
 		
  
 	
 	
 		this is one example i don't think the private sector's doing much better though
 	
 	
 		i'm pretty ignorant on taxes but on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">self-employed</ENAMEX> do you get any kind of credits for health insurance
 	
 	
 		
  
 		i get a credit <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year and last year</TIMEX> because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> specifically said i could get a credit
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		but the uh but it is it's going to expire which means i'm paying uh i get a sum a sum uh sum of the money back
 		but um not all of it of course um
 		i'm in a worst off position than someone who is employed who gets their health health care taken care of by their employer
 		um because i have to also obtain my insurance from is a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> middle <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> type deal
 		i have to go to go the small business service <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bureau</ENAMEX> and pay <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">eighty dollars</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> just for the right to buy health insurance
 		
  
 		works well for them but it's horrible for me
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		you know the consumer is going to pay in the end no matter what happens so
 	
 	
 		yeah i i i i
 	
 	
 		cost hidden or not
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		you just can't it's just it's sky rocketing i mean we're seeing increases <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every year ten</TIMEX> to fifteen percent
 		and you know it's it's gotten way out of hand and then and then you have these
