 
     		
 	
 		about you but i don't do whole lot
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh i don't do a whole lot mostly i you know
 		build stuff around the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> uh kinds of things uh
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		yeah
 		what what have you done
 	
 	
 		that's
 		um not too much put some chairs and cabinets and stuff back together and you know some book shelves and
 		you know junk like that a little rack to hold the maps and you know mail stuff you know the uh stamps and all that kind of junk in to go hang in the kitchen
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right
 		well that's cool
 		i used to do quite a bit when i was a little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX> but um recently i haven't done much at all i i did
 		uh i a while back i started refurbishing a piano we've had in our in our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> for a long time it's an old antique upright
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and uh kind of started to do some work with and stuff
 	
 	
 		sounds like a big project
 	
 	
 		uh yeah it is and i really haven't had time to do much with it
 		um it's a nice piano but it's just uh it's like uh like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">intro</ENAMEX> said if you had more time and more tools you know
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but uh other than that i i haven't done a whole lot i did kind of make a coffee table out of a piano bench which was interesting
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">um</ENAMEX> and that worked out pretty well i actually gave that to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> of mine since i really didn't have much use for it but uh
 		so you you got your <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> then  work out
 	
 	
 		uh no we're renting a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">townhouse</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		um so we're just and i just kind of had to have some kind of piddling to do all the time
 	
 	
 		sure is that what you consider a hobby then for you
 	
 	
 		excuse me
 	
 	
 		would that would you consider that a hobby then
 	
 	
 		um i guess sort of it mainly just you know i've all kind of have something all the time
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah for me i don't know it's
 		my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> is a is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">contractor</ENAMEX> and he actually does quite a bit of carpentry and wood work
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so i don't see him very often but last time i did we did some stuff he uh he had a job where he's putting in tongue and grooves slaps for a a ceiling actually
 		and so i i helped him do some of that and uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and like that but aside from that i'm a i'm a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Central Florida</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh-huh oh that sounds good
 	
 	
 		aside from my classes i don't do a lot of uh
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">woodworking</ENAMEX> per say i've got a lot of other hobbies but not necessarily that so
 	
 	
 		yeah i i guess it's kind of depends what your how loose your definition of woodworking is most of the stuff i do is not you know carving or anything like that it's mostly you know sawing stuff you know gluing putting things together that sort of stuff
 	
 	
 		right
 		i actually would like to do more of it though i kind of get into it it's it's fun to get started on something you know and and actually have a project that you're working on you know
 	
 	
 		yeah it's a lot of fun to have something that you're doing and uh you know it's when you're done with it there something there too
 	
 	
 		right you you've actually created something and had input into it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and also it's it i don't know i don't know about you but it's kind of neat to see something that you can create out <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wood</ENAMEX> you know it's like woe
 	
 	
 		yeah  uh-huh
 	
 	
 		didn't know you could do that
 		but uh and also some of the the little tools and and techniques that that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">carpenters</ENAMEX> use um my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girlfriend</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> is also is also a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">contractor</ENAMEX> in terms of carpentry and stuff
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and he'd made her bed and i was actually taking a look at it and some of the stuff uh you could see the techniques that he used to reinforce uh the braces and things like that
 		they're really pretty ingenious and
 		i hadn't seen them anywhere else there were some some um timing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce</ENAMEX> slots there and some things some particular methods that he'd used
 		um which were kind of neat and he's <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Vietnamese</ENAMEX> so i'm wondering if if maybe the cultural difference made a made a difference in the way he worked at
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um i didn't ask him about it but i
 	
 	
 		could be uh and seems like of uh stuff that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> make with wood
 		you know up until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of hundred years ago</TIMEX> you didn't have a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a abundance of iron</NUMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steel</ENAMEX> to join them together with
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah they had to kind of use some uh some different renovative kind of techniques to do that with
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		where do you where do you live again
 	
 	
 		uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DC</ENAMEX> area
 	
 	
 		okay so i'm thinking that's primarily pine <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> for the most part in that area
 	
 	
 		uh not too bad it's about i guess <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half and a half</NUMEX> pine <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> and various hard woods of you know
 	
 	
 		i'm thinking if you were to do something what kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wood</ENAMEX> would you most likely use over there
 		and i guess uh really you can get any any <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wood</ENAMEX> that's available but i'm thinking in terms of cost pine pine would probably be cheapest there
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah pine or possibly oak maybe but pine definitely
 	
 	
 		yeah <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">oak</ENAMEX> is a lot better i think
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah making  pine seems hardly worth it because it's so soft yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		it's real soft and and kind of pliable and that's that's not real good but uh
 	
 	
 		it's easy to work with but usually it doesn't last because it comes apart
 	
 	
 		yeah i used to live in a before i moved up to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minneapolis</ENAMEX> i i lived in a a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">duplex</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Orlando</ENAMEX>
 		and uh that had some work that had to be done with it some of the the door frames and things and uh i did a little bit of that and that was kind of interesting too kind of fun
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but uh for the most part down there it's it's once again it's pine or oak
