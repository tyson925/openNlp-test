 
     		
 	
 		opinion on whether we need to change to the metric system is that i don't think that i have an opinion one way or the other
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i kind of feel that there are more important issues to be dealt with than worrying about the metric system and i think the reason it failed last time is that most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> really just didn't see any real benefit in changing
 		so i guess if we were to go about making the change
 		you would have to really demonstrate to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that there is some legitimate reason to make the change that would directly benefit them otherwise we're never going to really see any change
 	
 	
 		yeah well
 		i oh i'll say this <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> i'm certainly for conversion to the metric system unfortunately i'm not sure how well grounded my uh feelings for that are maybe it's
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		just because it's a highly regular system and you don't have to worry about whether something is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five thousand two hundred and eighty</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">units</ENAMEX> or or
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i'm just going to walk over here and stop my <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> from doing what they're doing um and the metric system is you know
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		you it has so many different prefixes like autometer and femtometer and stuff like that you don't need them just use the you know the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">meter the kilometer</NUMEX> you know whatever it's i don't know that that's i think that's its primary uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		primary uh use is that
 		and of course in scientific uses uh things like the like a mile uh or i'm not sure a pound uh have have some use whenever you try to uh combine them into formula then you have to
 		uh have conversion constants and things like that so most most of the formulas although they are are some that uh don't obey this rule
 		most scientific formulas can be adapted with the metric system because of the way things are interrelated that you'll need those extra conversion constants
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		like a cubic let's see what is it a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">cubic centimeter</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> is also a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">gram</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> at standard temperature and pressure
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		well whenever the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadians</ENAMEX> changed we're since we're very close to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> border here we kind of observed things when they made their change
 		and they were able to convert a little more readily although most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> up there still would talk in terms of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fahrenheit</ENAMEX> instead of Celsius
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh even though they try to get you to use the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Celsius</ENAMEX> system it it went a little easier because <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> is so influenced by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and a lot of the products and services that they were either dealing with or receiving on their end were really equipped for the metric system
 		and uh it was a easier change and they saw some direct benefit because they didn't have to pour the extra income in to making special products just for the  older system
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but um you know in in this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> you have really stubborn people
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true
 	
 	
 		who i don't think are going to especially you know they may do it in the more in the big city <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> or in certain round uh manufacturing industries
 		but the average <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Raleigh Missouri</ENAMEX> i don't think is going to what was this celsius stuff you know i don't
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well it it happens first well it i guess it happens <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> in either of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> places i guess either in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> or just products
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		uh one thing about uh a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> products i'm just looking at something here <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">shaving cream</ENAMEX> that is not in this case
 		uh list both what they are in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Imperial System</ENAMEX> whatever it's called units uh and the metric system <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">units</ENAMEX> so this just says <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">seven ounces</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh i i think i've heard that in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> what they did was primarily they didn't change the size the sizes that various products came in they just changed the way they were annotated
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so something before was you know was and see you have things in odd measurements that's even true like for film and like you know <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">sixteen millimeter and thirty five millimeter</NUMEX> film
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		those odd things come about i'm not sure exactly what they are because it's like <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a half inch</NUMEX> or whatever they just
 		you know they say okay millimeter this is a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> thing too
 		so uh we'll just used to keep using the standard size but we'll just call it something else so you have odd things like <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">sixteen millimeter and thirty five millimeter</NUMEX> where originated in the metric system it'll probably be something regular but i guess that's that's not too
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		not too important but i think uh at least in northern or northeastern <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> uh they <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are relatively uh well inducted into the metric system
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		anyone who takes you know chemistry physics anything like that in school i think in most cases it's done in in metric system it was for me
 	
 	
 		yeah i
 		i learned metrics you know in high school and and before that so i'm familiar with the system i'm still using inches and pounds and the like
 		i the only thing we as <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> have become accustomed to as far as the metric system is now we buy <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">two liter</NUMEX> bottles of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coke</ENAMEX> you know
 	
 	
 		yeah when you tell somebody liters bottles of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coke</ENAMEX> yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		that's true that is and oddity
 	
 	
 		i mean it sounds you know a gallon sounds like that's too much but <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> liters and and you know doesn't sound as bad as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> quarts or
