 
     		
 	
 		okay um let me see  i've been sitting here awhile i almost forgot the topic but uh it seems like i get most of my news from television
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i'm we only get the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> on the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekends</TIMEX> and so i'm not much of a
 		of a paper <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX> or
 		but i i and i'm don't rarely listen to the um radio so it i get most of my news like from documentaries like <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Forty Eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hours Twenty Twenty</ENAMEX> you know it the news at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		news news in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the afternoon</TIMEX> and that kind of thing
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well i i get a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekend</TIMEX> paper as well and uh in addition to that i get a local weekly i i live in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">suburb</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Milwaukee</ENAMEX> and they get they
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		have community <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX> around here so the local their extremely local  stuff uh is in the local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> that comes out once a week and then i get the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sunday</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">uh Milwaukee Journal</ENAMEX> because i don't have time to read a paper uh mostly that's my difficulty i uh i get my news pretty much from the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> as you do although i do listen to NPR
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		which has very good and that's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Public Radio</ENAMEX> which has very good uh coverage of the national and international news i feel and does a pretty good job of analysis as well usually
 	
 	
 		huh
 		um
 		are you in the car quite a bit or
 	
 	
 		no i'm not actually uh but i can run my radio in my office i i i teach at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">university</ENAMEX> and when i'm not
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		teaching if i choose to have the radio on i can listen to that <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX> so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh oh i see um
 	
 	
 		how how are you are you satisfied with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Twenty Twenty</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Forty Eight Hours</ENAMEX> and the things that you do watch
 	
 	
 		yeah i i i pretty much am and i watch the news at least twice a day
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so uh if i've missed something and and and i've just recently decided to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> with my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and so it seems as if i catch the news rise right as it happens happens you know there was
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh the explosions and that kind of thing my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> will say how'd you know about that and i said yes it happened at such and such time and that's so that that's different for me so i usually find out when exactly when it happens and that kind of thing
 	
 	
 		is that the aspect of the news that you're most interested in is is the timely you noting noting of the events as they happen is that what you feel good about in the news coverage
 	
 	
 		uh no it just seems like since i've recently stayed home
 		that that is what's happened you know it's just that uh
 		i now that i've stayed home i'm i'm usually aware of when when these things have occurred and it happened and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		well i i myself uh the the reason why i listen to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPR</ENAMEX> and the reason why i watch <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">MacNeil Lehrer</ENAMEX> rather than the
 		than the network shows news shows at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> although i do often watch a local <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">ten o'clock in the evening</TIMEX> news which shows shows you know carries over a lot of the national news stories uh is that
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		quite often it seems to me that  the national doesn't do a very good job of analysis
 		the local doesn't either but i feel that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">MacNeil Lehrer</ENAMEX> get a little more deeply into some some of the issues that are really current
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and perhaps <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX> do that but as i said i don't have time to sit down and read a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX> and frankly when i have read a newspaper i haven't noticed that kind of analysis either
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		hum
 	
 	
 		so um
 		there's there is some danger to that of course too because if the analysis is inaccurate or biased or whatever then
 		you know how good is it but
 		uh i like a little more indepth coverage and i think that's what you're maybe appealing to you too on something like <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twenty Twenty or Forty Eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Hours</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		right right it kind of gives you the whole story or more of the story that kind of thing
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so
 		um
 	
 	
 		i'm more interested in trying to understand what's going on in the world rather than simply being aware that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know there that an event has occurred
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i i like to stand back and get a slightly bigger picture maybe because i'm easily confused by detail i don't know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah i know what you're saying
 	
 	
 		
 
 		so
 	
 	
 		yeah but i try and catch most of those programs  on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesdays</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Fridays</TIMEX> and if i miss them i try and
 		you know i try and and uh tape them if i'm out or that kind of thing i try and tape them and
 		so i can sit back and watch it and it's pretty interesting um
 	
 	
 		when you have young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> right
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">those evening</TIMEX> shows are probably also at a time when you're at liberty to take some time off and be in front of the TV set for awhile without interruption
 	
 	
 		yeah well yeah plus i find i have to video tape quite a bit of things if i don't want any interruptions yeah that kind of thing
 	
 	
 		oh you do uh-huh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh</ENAMEX> when is your good watching time
 	
 	
 		um it seems like <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">ten o'clock at night</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yes
 		yeah that's what what
 	
 	
 		unfortunately but that's that's what it seems like <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">ten o'clock at night</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		i have older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and getting dinner on the table i come from the east coast and i was
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it amazed me when i got out here to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">midwest</ENAMEX> and found out that even though they're an hour earlier in time they still watch the news when <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>
