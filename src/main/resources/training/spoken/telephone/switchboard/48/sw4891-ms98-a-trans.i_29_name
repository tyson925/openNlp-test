 		um
 		just sweared i heard that beep but usually
 		you can hear the tape or you can hear it starting  um
 	
 	
 		oh i've never go ahead
 	
 	
 		uh no  no i am a very organized <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> that believes i ought to have all those things and we don't
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh</ENAMEX> so you it's not just you you have a family
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yes i'm married i have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> um young <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four and a half</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> and
 		as far as sitting down and putting a formal budget paper and pen you know and following it no we don't do that
 		um i have a very good idea of what our expenses are and how much we can afford to spend and can't spend and
 		you know so it it's not like we just totally don't have a clue as to what's going on but i wish we were a little more organized a little more
 	
 	
 		you know when i think about it there are certain parameters we work about
 	
 	
 		faithful to a budget
 	
 	
 		but we don't have a budget where it says its so much for this and so much for that but we do put a certain amount in checking account each month which we should pay for the mortgage and the electric bill and all that
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and i know there's a certain number i put on my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">grocery</ENAMEX> and pocket money
 		and sometimes i have a little left over and i kind of put it away but <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next week</TIMEX> i pull it out and add it to that number
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right
 	
 	
 		and i know that i don't go above that and i know that when we empty out the mortgage and the electric bill money and all that that you know
 		you got to stop spending but you know i i don't know if i can say i guess with the grocery and pocket money i do have a particular number but
 	
 	
 		that's right that's right
 	
 	
 		you know you never know if if you own a home you never know if something's going to break and you're gonna need more
 	
 	
 		that's right well it's very difficult my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> is in is self-employed he's in uh financial planning and and so all of his income is commissions
 		it's very hard to sit down and budget because you don't know what he's going to make uh you know we kind of think you know he usually brings <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> at least this much and i can base you know base it from there
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but there's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> that he brings home uh you know <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times that much and there's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">some months</TIMEX> he doesn't bring home anything it just depends on where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">commissions</ENAMEX> fall and so you kind of have to you know i have in in my mind i know the basics i know what we've got to meet each month
 		you know and and my salary helps towards that because <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mine</ENAMEX>'s set you know but um
 		i think that we could probably save a little better or afford to do more things for fun that we'd like to do if i did follow a  you know pencil and paper budget but
 	
 	
 		do you <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX> get to save
 	
 	
 		well differently i mean do i have a savings account sitting in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX> no but uh we do have you know universal life insurance on him we have um
 		a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">401K</NUMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CODA</ENAMEX> plan preretirement plan on me through my work uh so there are things that we have money invested in you know i have a profit sharing and pension uh savings more toward retirement
 		now savings sitting at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX> that hey let's plan a vacation no when we decide we wanna do something like that we start saving for that and when we get it we go
 	
 	
 		right you know cause i i'm finding more and more that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> don't have so many dollars left after they spend on what they have to spend i
 		i think it's the rare <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> who says well i'm just putting money away for my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> and and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every week</TIMEX> puts in fifty dollars or something i don't i think <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> aren't having much left at all nowadays
 	
 	
 		right
 		i think it's more and more difficult i do have savings accounts for my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> at work
 		and um and i use that for their uh life insurance investments uh but
 		i also pull from that and from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mine</ENAMEX> if we need the money you know if you need it for something or like you said the something comes up on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and you've got to have it well you go deplete those funds and use it you know
 	
 	
 		right that come from somewhere
 		yeah i work part time i'm a substitute art teacher
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so you know we try to live on my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>'s salary and when i want something frivolous that he probably wouldn't agree to i just you know spend my own money or chip it in when you know something big comes up
 	
 	
 		that's true
 		now we have an interesting arrangement my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> loves golf
 		and i'm glad he has i mean it's his release it's his time <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each week</TIMEX> where he's not <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> and he's not <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> and he's not employee and he you know what i'm saying it's just a release
 	
 	
 		i thought you said when he's not dead  not dad  well jeez
 	
 	
 		and no <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad  dad</ENAMEX>  not dead  i'll have to work on that uh
 		and and i'm glad he has that i'm glad he enjoys it but i used to resent it because i felt like all of our spare money went to his golf
 		i don't particularly have anything i like to do from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week to week or day</TIMEX> to day or or anything like that and that's fine
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">um</ENAMEX> and so what i started doing and he's never said you know if i wanted something i'd look in the checkbook because i'm to practical and say nah i'd better not spend the money
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		well he's never held me back you know he's always said if you want something go get it
 		but i didn't feel comfortable so now when he goes and golfs i take you know if he takes out <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> bucks or fifteen bucks or <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty</TIMEX> bucks i take the same amount and i stick it in a savings account that i have at the credit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">union</ENAMEX> at work
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and i save for something i want because
