 
     		
 	
 		happen to know what the laws are in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh capital punishment is uh you know accepted an accepted punishment it it's legal
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh there are uh there have been a number of executions
 		over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last few years</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		uh
 		they drag you know the the appeals drag on interminably it seems sometimes
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">um</ENAMEX> personally i kept i keep thinking that if i could be guaranteed that
 		the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who perpetrate some of these vicious crimes were never allowed free then i would not be in favor of capital punishment
 		but when
 	
 	
 		oh i see what you're saying
 	
 	
 		but uh when i know that
 		uh they could be paroled and go right back to doing what they did before i i feel decidedly uneasy uneasy about it
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		what about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		well in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> i'm not quite sure but what sounds familiar to me is that  it's it's not legal except in cases of murder of police <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh okay</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i might be mistaken but that's what sounds familiar to me
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so uh so we don't hear about it
 	
 	
 		well
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i was visiting in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> recently and apparently they over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about two weeks ago</TIMEX> they just executed one fellow
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it is legal there but they they always put it off and put it off and they finally for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty five years</TIMEX> executed someone
 	
 	
 		yes
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yes
 	
 	
 		so that was quite the news
 	
 	
 		i remember reading about that
 		um
 	
 	
 		is it only usually in cases of murder sort of an eye for an eye kind of thing
 	
 	
 		it's uh it's more than that i think it's a capital murder uh where
 		uh there there was an intent to do other harm as well you know where you you engaged in another felony like robbery at at the same time that you murdered someone
 	
 	
 		okay i know there's a a subtle subtle difference between manslaughter and murder
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		i guess you can commit manslaughter by running somebody over by accident that kind of thing
 	
 	
 		by accident
 		yes
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		that's my understanding of it uh but that uh murder is something that you do intentionally
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		i don't know it just seems to me that
 		everybody wants to know if they do something what's going to happen to them
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i substitute teach and i have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> who talk fresh don't do homework and they say so what's going to happen to me and
 		and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> getting less and less respect and they understand they know that the bottom line is not very much is going to happen to them
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so if i could be sure that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who are sentenced to execution absolutely did it because you know during the with the jury system you're not quite sure
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		no you're not
 	
 	
 		you know i i i'd feel comfortable with it if i knew absolutely certainly that this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> actually murdered someone
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		or
 	
 	
 		but i i think the reason we don't go for it is because we're afraid that we might be making a mistake and you can't fix it
 	
 	
 		that's right and and it's a terrible thing to do uh
 		and the world our world seems to become more and more violent all the time by the way i'm a public school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">administrator</ENAMEX>  so
 	
 	
 		okay
 		well did you do you find that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> are changing and they they don't they they don't respect <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authority</ENAMEX> anymore
 	
 	
 		oh
 		at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">all</TIMEX>
 		they they do not respect authority uh they kill for fun
 	
 	
 		i
 	
 	
 		uh
 		they shoot <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX> for amusement after parties um
 	
 	
 		hum well the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX> are legal where you are it's quite a to do to get a gun around here legally that is
 	
 	
 		yes
 		well it it's not it's not legal to carry a handgun in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> but no it's not you can have it in your home
 	
 	
 		oh i didn't know that
 		okay
 	
 	
 		or in your <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> if you're traveling
 		from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> to another
 	
 	
 		oh okay that clears that
 	
 	
 		but uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">rifles</ENAMEX> shotguns those sorts of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX> are legal
 	
 	
 		um-hum well they can do just as much damage
 	
 	
 		oh yes it's just that they're harder to hide
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		but i do  i feel decidedly uneasy about the judicial system in our <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> now not only because we can't be sure that the jury
 		you know has made the right decision that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> who did it's really guilty or really isn't guilty
 		and yet i feel very uncomfortable about the numbers of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who are paroled put back on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> and within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few months</TIMEX> are raping and killing other people
