 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay uh  let me see i've got <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> is uh both preschoolers one is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> and one is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">um four</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so and um  this is my <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">first year</TIMEX> off and i've always worked uh the time that they were little and so i decided to
 		hold off on my job for a while and stay home with them and  spend some more time with them which i hadn't been doing
 	
 	
 		well i think that's wonderful my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> are in college
 	
 	
 		so
 		oh
 	
 	
 		but i teach <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> and i teach uh middle school age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		and so i see a lot of uh variation in what happens when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> are at home
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i have taught <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> ever since my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> were little but the advantage of teaching <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> is your <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">hours</TIMEX> are closer to your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>'s and your <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">holidays</TIMEX> are too so teaching i think is a
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		a good career to have and still be able to spend a lot of quality time with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah  well that's what i was doing before i was teaching for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Richardson School District</ENAMEX> and um it just seemed like it took a lot of my time with them being so little and it was really hard
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		right well with them being as young it was much much harder when <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mine</ENAMEX> were young
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh i really didn't have that much of a choice because my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> was trying to finish his uh college work
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Master</ENAMEX>'s degree and so forth and so it was a matter of somebody had to have a full-time job
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that's right that's right and that's what was kind of what what where we were when you know we  i really didn't have to work but i felt like i really wanted to work
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i felt i awful i felt like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> i was sure was missing a lot and they were growing so fast and
 		you know it's like do i really need to work you know  and i and it that choice was there i really didn't have to and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know  so i did have that advantage there but  it's different staying at home too you know it's an adjustment to make also
 	
 	
 		yes it certainly is we
 		well i think that um
 		we need to spend more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> time together with with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> uh we made a point to spend a lot of quality time and the activities that we were involved in were the activities the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> were
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		involved in you know like uh through scouting or you know anything like that we participated and uh we always made a point to have breakfast together and supper together now
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		wow that's great
 	
 	
 		when yeah  when uh
 		the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> were in high school it was harder to always have supper together but we did always have breakfast together
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so we we had supper together as much as possible but when it wasn't
 		feasible you know we kind of kept a master calendar
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and when it wasn't feasible well that was understandable but uh we've always tried to spend time to talk and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		have some time together time and we sat around the table we didn't sit in front of a TV or
 	
 	
 		ah that's great because that's
 	
 	
 		that kind of thing so i think that's been important because we do have a close <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> and even though the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> are basically uh grown uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		they still like to sit down at the table and us all eat together when they're here and uh  have spoken before of they want that kind of situation
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know situation for them when you know and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> when they marry and have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah kind of grows on and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		they do what they see and you know
 	
 	
 		that's right they model and the with the dysfunctional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> today i'm sure you with a as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">schoolteacher</ENAMEX> also you see what happens to these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		when these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> never communicate or they're dysfunctional as far as the between uh oh <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> or uh
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parent families</ENAMEX> or all those kinds of problems that they have and then you see them magnified magnified in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh yeah</ENAMEX>
 		yeah yeah plus you teach middle school so i'm sure that
 	
 	
 		oh boy yes
 	
 	
 		you are really you really boy oh boy i taught early childhood so i had the little ones
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yes
 	
 	
 		and um you know i saw it there too and you you know you just
 		oh it's it kind of an eye-opener you know so
 	
 	
 		it is
 		it is and most i think most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> realize the value of quality time with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and i think we make a point to do that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah i think you're right
 	
 	
 		because we see we see all the time the outcome of not doing that and i think if we weren't so interested in in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> in childfaring we wouldn't be teaching anyway
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right right
 	
 	
 		so uh i wish we could reach more of the rest of the world
 	
 	
 		okay
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		because i think uh the major problems in education are not what's happening in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> it's what's happening in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> and uh they expect us to
 	
 	
 		i agree yeah
 	
 	
 		you know have create miracles at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> and fix all the problems and take over the roles of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> as well as that of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> and you get to a point where it's completely impossible
 	
 	
 		uh yeah
 		yeah i agree i i know exactly what you're saying
 	
 	
 		and you just get more and more frustrated and yet you feel for the the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> you do the best you can but
