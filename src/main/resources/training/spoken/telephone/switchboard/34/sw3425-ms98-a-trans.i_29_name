 		well i uh i uh have uh i walk and run every um almost every <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> i've sort of stopped here with the weather change but uh it's <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about a thirty minute</TIMEX> exercise every <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum every <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> well my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> swims <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX> at lunch which he loves doing and

 		oh
 		the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the the bicycling</TIMEX> is nice especially with the weather around here and i know um uh we we both of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> and i both
 		do it to just  keep the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">pounds</NUMEX> off we're getting up in age i guess in uh our late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirties</TIMEX> so we need to keep exercising just to be able to um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		it keeps going because i'm fifty <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> and it uh it just gets worse worse you still <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">wanna</ENAMEX> eat and uh but you just i think you feel better too if you get on some program like that but uh
