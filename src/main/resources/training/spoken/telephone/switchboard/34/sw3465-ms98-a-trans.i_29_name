 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
  
 		okay um i i guess um
 		you know i really i remember what <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> was like when i grew up and uh you know back then
 		i believe i really do believe <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> had more respect for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> back then
 	
 	
 		well that's what i was thinking the discipline just isn't there anymore like it used to be
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and they've lost the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> have lost control
 	
 	
 		yeah i agree and i don't know  i you know i think some of that stems with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> but
 	
 	
 		well i think so too
 	
 	
 		i i think some of it also stems from just society in general  because <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> aren't looked looked upon as uh you know like with as much respect as they use the to be
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		because back then you know if you were a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher people</ENAMEX> used to think oh you know that you know that's great and nowadays if you're a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> it's like oh you had nothing else that you could come up with to do so you decided to go into teaching
 	
 	
 		yeah well they didn't used to sue the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> like they're doing now and that's why why the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> are in so much trouble
 	
 	
 		you know it's like
 		yeah that too
 		that's true
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		that's really too bad that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> don't have have control over the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> like they used to
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true yeah my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>'s a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> but she teaches preschool
 	
 	
 		and see the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">um parents</ENAMEX> used to back up the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> too they would sit they would tell the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> now you do what your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> says
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		um-hum that's right
 	
 	
 		and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> would let them know if they weren't doing the right thing and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> would be right there on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> but
 	
 	
 		that's right and it seems to me like now it's just the opposite
 		in in a in a lot of cases you know the
 	
 	
 		that's right that's right
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> are behind their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> now and they believe the things that they say about the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> so
 	
 	
 		right
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah i
 	
 	
 		i don't know how they would correct it
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah and i also don't believe that you know uh you know physical punishment is is really the answer either uh
 	
 	
 		no i don't believe that either
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> because you know a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>
 		you know they get that at home you know they don't need it at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> either they need some other way of
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		of discipline that's you know it's going to uh more or less snap you know snap the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> around  and and get them you know just just earn some respect
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know anybody can beat up on anybody else
 	
 	
 		well they should just for the discipline at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> they should just uh take away some of their things that they enjoy the most
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i guess it really would i mean doesn't matter what age the the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> is you know anywhere from
 		preschool to you know <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teenagers</ENAMEX> you know you take away what they what they want and enjoy then they're going to pay attention to you
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		i have a sister that's a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> grade <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> she teaches <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> grade
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and she just she thoroughly enjoys the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> she really likes them
 	
 	
 		yes yes
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i'm gonna i'm going back to school i'm gonna start back in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January</TIMEX> get my teaching certificate i'm gonna teach high school
 	
 	
 		
 
 		ooh you're brave
 	
 	
 		i'm gonna be a home economics teacher
 	
 	
 		
 
 		ah
 		you know i i think maybe it might not be too bad of an idea  you you i don't know if you've seen the movie where the the principal cracks down on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> and he says okay let me know who all the trouble <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">makers</ENAMEX> are and they're out of here
 		and i'm wondering how practical that is to apply to you know to all the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> it's
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i mean i wonder if that would work or not or what kind of alternative they could provide for these you know troubled <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> and trouble <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">makers</ENAMEX> that type of thing
 	
 	
 		well you know the main there's a big really another big problem and that's the drop out problem now all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> are dropping out and i think it's because the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> don't tell them they can't
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah that's right
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> don't
 		don't um you know the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> say well i don't want to do that anymore and then the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> say well okay whatever you think and that's what that wasn't that way when i was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah that's true
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> and we'd say why do we have to do that and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> would say because i told you so  and you do what i say see they found they've
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right right
 	
 	
 		they've uh lost whoever's supposed to take charge here
 	
 	
 		yeah it it's getting to the point where you know where well you know it's kind of with both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> having to work it's really hard to uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that has a lot to do with it too uh-huh they can't watch over their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> anymore like they used to
 	
 	
 		uh to have the strength
 		yeah yeah and then when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mom</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> do give notice at home then you know they're too tired from working <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">all day</TIMEX> long they just assume let them do whatever they want and
 	
 	
 		neat
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		don't bother me i'm tired
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah it's really too bad
 	
 	
 		and that doesn't help either that's true
 	
 	
 		because it depends on what they do in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> as how they're going to
 		do their future things in life
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true especially i think at the younger ages uh elementary
 		you know  i i think maybe you know i hate to say you know one <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> teaching a certain grade is is higher priority than another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> but you know so much of of what they experience in their early years
 	
 	
 		oh that's right they need the basics too in the education they need that reading and writing
 	
 	
 		sets a pattern
