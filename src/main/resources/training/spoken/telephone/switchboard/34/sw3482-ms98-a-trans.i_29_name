 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		oh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh i think it's adopted me so i think it's my <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> now because i even took it and had its shots but because it's so friendly
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh you're kidding uh
 	
 	
 		i was afraid she hadn't well i'll ask her she had not had it's <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">shots</ENAMEX> so i was concerned so i took it and had the shots
 	
 	
 		oh
 		yeah
 		that's not good
 	
 	
 		no it's a beautiful gray <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> it's real sweet but anyway i'm i have to travel a lot right now in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about um another year</TIMEX> i'll probably get another <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> because i'll be through traveling
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		huh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		so you're a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> huh
 	
 	
 		well
 		i think so i don't know how to handle cats
 	
 	
 		really i i used to have a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> and he actually he died <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this summer</TIMEX> but uh i had him for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirteen years</TIMEX> and when we got this <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> i didn't know what to do it just i never had a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> before in my whole life
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and it was it's really different to have a different type of animal
 	
 	
 		well i i just don't know much about <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> and i um i don't know why i don't they see to themselves i think more than <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> do so that
 	
 	
 		yes they do they're very self sufficient and they don't demand nearly as much attention or care
 	
 	
 		that's right they say you you um
 		have a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> but you what is the saying that you never really own a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> that you may own a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> but you the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> just kind of tolerate tolerates you
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yes that's right that's right
 	
 	
 		well do you um um have your are you going to breed your <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		no huh-uh he's been neutered
 	
 	
 		oh its just just for fun huh
 	
 	
 		oh yeah he's just a pet and he he actually has turned out to be a great watchdog too so
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		have you been to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North Park</ENAMEX> to see the kennel they have over there <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> that you can adopt a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> you know for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the holidays</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		no
 		uh no i haven't well i certainly don't need another one
 	
 	
 		that's real cute
 		well don't go over there then because it really hurt touches you when you see those that are up for adoption
 	
 	
 		i know
 		well you know i went before we got this <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> we were looking around and we went to um some humane <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">societies</ENAMEX> and that sort of thing and they would not allow us to adopt a dog
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		how come
 	
 	
 		because we both work and they required someone to be home all the time and quite honestly i think probably some <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> got put to sleep that could've had a good home i mean
 	
 	
 		oh
 		well i didn't realize that because i most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> do work <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">now</TIMEX> and uh that's surprising
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that's right
 		yeah and i was too and and also there you know they come out and inspect your property and make sure you have a fence it has to be like an <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> foot fence and our fence only happens to be <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">six feet</NUMEX> i mean i'm not
 	
 	
 		but your little <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> can't go over an <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> foot fence
 	
 	
 		no no  i just
 	
 	
 		so did you have to end up buying him
 	
 	
 		yeah we ended we ended up we got him it was sort of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">flea</ENAMEX> market but they had a pet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX> had a little shop setup
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and yeah we ended up buying a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> which isn't you know really what i wanted to do but i couldn't pass the requirements
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		isn't that i didn't realize that well did you go to
 	
 	
 		and yeah and i'll tell you my <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> is spoiled
 	
 	
 		well somebody told me that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richardson</ENAMEX> kennel was good or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Richardson</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		what do you call it where they pound i guess is real good about letting you have them there so i don't know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah i guess we should've tried the pound but the humane society uh wasn't interested in giving us a pet so
 	
 	
 		huh well that's terrible
 	
 	
 		yeah i thought it was too but
 	
 	
 		i don't know how long we're supposed to talk do you
 	
 	
 		um it's usually like <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five minutes</TIMEX> not too long
 	
 	
 		okay so i well does it  does the recording come on or something
 	
 	
 		no you just sort of decide when you're done talking and that's it did you
 	
 	
 		okay  well do you work in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah i work at <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> yeah
