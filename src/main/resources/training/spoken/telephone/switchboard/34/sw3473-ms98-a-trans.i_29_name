 
     		
 	
 		okay go ahead
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well i  i live we're gonna compare notes um i uh i
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		myself often desire to exercise often believe i should and rarely do
 	
 	
 		don't do it
 		well i tell you i i firmly believe in exercising i think it's a i do it everyday on a regular basis i
 	
 	
 		what what what sort of of regiment do you have
 	
 	
 		well i just got back from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">biking twelve and a half miles</NUMEX> but <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this time of year</TIMEX> you can't get much biking in uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but every <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> i use this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX>'s uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">council</ENAMEX> of physical fitness and it really is
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh uh it's worth doing and you can do it anywhere i i travel quite a bit in my in my business and you can do it
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		you know wherever you're at and if you do it i i do it every <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> after uh usually after breakfast before i take a shower and get you know dressed going you know to go to work
 	
 	
 		yes
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh now what i do i mean i've done this for you know like fifteen <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> so you don't start at this kind of regiment you know i so what i'm telling you isn't something you go out and do and because you'll hurt yourself
 	
 	
 		yes
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh every every uh you know it takes me about <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">fifteen minutes</TIMEX> to do this now because i do it all the time but i uh i do <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty five um</TIMEX>
 		uh what where you have your <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX> above your head and and your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> twisters touch you know left and right toe
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		right
 	
 	
 		then i do uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> uh right and left uh trunk twisters
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i do uh about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixty</TIMEX> uh
 		uh you know bicycle type uh leg thrust type things
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i do uh twenty uh leg lifters on each side you know when you're prone laying on the floor
 	
 	
 		yes yes right
 	
 	
 		and then i do fifty push-ups and do <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred</NUMEX> sit ups and uh then i do about uh
 	
 	
 		my goodness you do all of this in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">fifteen minutes</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh yeah oh yeah and then uh thirty uh now if you did football like like the old grass drills where you're on your stomach and you you know prone type things where you're kind of rocking on your stomach type thing
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but that takes <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about really about maybe about thirteen minutes</TIMEX> uh you know in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX> to do it but
 	
 	
 		yeah now what what keeps you doing that i mean i i sometimes start start little much less much more modest efforts  but i  give up i just find them boring and hard to
 	
 	
 		well um
 	
 	
 		find time for it on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a given day</TIMEX> and
 	
 	
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX> i used to uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">referee</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">football</ENAMEX> and uh to stay in condition i did that uh just as a normal basis and uh uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yes
 		yes
 	
 	
 		i tell you just by doing it uh well
 		example <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this summer</TIMEX> i i was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about fifteen pounds</NUMEX> heavier than i wanted to be so i i increased
 		i do <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three hundred</NUMEX> sit ups <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a day</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">now</TIMEX> but not at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">that in the morning</TIMEX> i do <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred</NUMEX> then and then i do <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about a hundred</NUMEX> before supper and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about a hundred</NUMEX> before i go to bed i lost <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fifteen</NUMEX> pounds
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		just by doing that because you tighten your stomach muscles and you can you know you can eat anything you want drink anything you want but you don't you know within within reason you know you can lose weight or maintain your weight and your physical your physical being and uh
 	
 	
 		yes
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i just you know you're ready to go at a i i i think it's really important
 	
 	
 		well i i i whenever i do it i feel good
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i mean good that i have done good because it's it seems right and good because it has good effects but but it's this maintaining a a regular habit that i just can't seem to do
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well well that's why <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chuck</ENAMEX> i think uh if you did it on a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> basis and you didn't need elaborate things you know where you can make excuses like
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		well i i like biking and during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> i'll do you know <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">at least seventy five miles</NUMEX> a week and when i really was doing it maybe <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a hundred</TIMEX> and fifty but you can't
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know there's excuses the weather or you don't have time or something like that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but if you do some basic exercises and you say every <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> just like brushing your teeth you're gonna spend <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">fifteen minutes</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a half hour</TIMEX> and you get up <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a half hour</TIMEX> earlier
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and once you start getting into that one you just feel good and you look a whole lot better
 	
 	
 		yes
 		yes do you do you does your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> participate in any of this or
 	
 	
 		unfortunately not and there's no way i can get her to so it's a like it's something you either just really want to do it or  you can't talk anyone into it if you don't like to exercise you know it isn't going to happen but
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 		yes yes
 	
 	
 		i i sure wish she would she's you know unfortunately <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">overweight</ENAMEX> and but she's a wonderful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> and you know no sense getting in arguments with her anybody about it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah yeah well i uh i uh i keep saying if somebody else would do it with me i  that would be a little bit of peer pressure would help considerably
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		but you seemed to have solved solved that problem without any any external
 	
 	
 		no problem at all and uh if you get one of these mats you know go to a store they normally have these exercise things these ABCs of physical fitness on them
 	
 	
 		help
 		yes
 	
 	
 		my one of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> got me one of those for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas one year</TIMEX> and uh
 	
 	
 		what what what what's on what's this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mat</ENAMEX> i mean in
 	
 	
 		it it it's just an exercise <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mat</ENAMEX> that rolls up so you can put it out you know just in the corner
 	
 	
 		is it like the sort of thing you take on a camping trip and sleep on it i mean it's that it's that kind of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">like half</NUMEX> inch of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foam</ENAMEX> or something
 	
 	
 		well yeah you can do that
 		but but it doesn't
 		yeah yeah it's a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foam</ENAMEX> thing yeah yeah and it's it's just <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about six feet</NUMEX> long it rolls up
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i don't take it on trips with me i you could but uh i don't mind uh you know if i do like sit ups i'll throw a
 		a towel down or something and you know so you don't have the abrasive
 	
 	
 		yeah
