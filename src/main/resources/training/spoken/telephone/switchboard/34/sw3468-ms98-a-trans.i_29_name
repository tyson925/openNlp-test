 		um <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three bedroom two and a half</TIMEX> bath <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> story town <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Atlanta</ENAMEX> about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten years ago</TIMEX>
 		that i started i was just going to touch up paint in a couple of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> before it was over i wound up painting the entire thing because the more i did it the worse it made everything else look
 	
 	
 		the rest look
 	
 	
 		so anyway but that included ceilings walls woodwork and everything and and you know i found out number one i can do it you know and i was i was really pleased with the results after it was finally finished but gosh it was a lot of work
 	
 	
 		yeah but you feel good about it when you've done it yourself and you do save a lot of money
 	
 	
 		yeah you really do
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but it's a mess and it's hard to find the time
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh</ENAMEX> it is and well i was fortunate at the time i had a job that uh i uh
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		it was restrictly an <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">eight hour</TIMEX> job and uh so i but that really cut my social life out for gosh i don't know about a month and a half it seems like all i did i mean every spare minute i had a paint brush in my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hand</ENAMEX> or a roller
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but like you say it it made a difference and it really increased the value of my property when i sold it i'm sure
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		oh yeah it does yeah i've painted inside i haven't painted outside and that's what i need done now
 	
 	
 		yeah well my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister-in-law</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Austin</ENAMEX> uh are just finishing painting the entire outside of their house their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> is almost all wood
 	
 	
 		but
 		um
 	
 	
 		and what a lot of work that was and they had to scrape it and then
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that's the work yeah that's it
 	
 	
 		yeah and then putty and caulk and paint and i was up there <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about a month ago</TIMEX> and what they had done looked marvelous but i mean the work was tremendous
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i don't think i'll attempt that myself i i know i won't  yeah i'll hire somebody to do that but in fact i had a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workman</ENAMEX> here for a leak that he had to fix and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten</TIMEX> dollars he was willing to paint my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX>'s ceiling
 		so i said go ahead you paint the ceiling and then i'll do the walls and that was that was nice
 	
 	
 		listen you got a great bargain for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX>  for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten</TIMEX> dollars  let
 	
 	
 		yeah for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten</TIMEX> dollars  he was saying he was chatting and we were having a good old time so he just said all right <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten</TIMEX> dollars i'll do the ceiling
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		i that's incredible i because painting the ceilings is absolutely the worst thing and and especially
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		it is
 	
 	
 		especially so so many ceilings have this horrible you know this horrible texture that's just like you know <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">popcorn</ENAMEX> blown
 	
 	
 		right right well hers didn't it was just a smooth ceiling but
 	
 	
 		yeah but but the place that i had in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Atlanta</ENAMEX> that i wound up painting the ceilings everywhere it had a pretty pretty much a lot of texture on
 		and it just was a nightmare to paint and i just you know i
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		just i i got it now i accumulated a lot of drop cloths and i had my painting gear that you know the same clothes i'd just throw them in the washer and you know wear them again and pretty soon they were just you know tie-dyed with paint
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but you know painting the ceiling if it's not smooth can really be a nightmare
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i have that in my living room and dining <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> but we had a leak
 		and the insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>'s gonna pay to do the whole area
 	
 	
 		wow that's good
 	
 	
 		so that's gonna be a good deal i won't have to worry about that
 	
 	
 		yeah what was so funny with my my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister-in-law</ENAMEX> in in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Austin</ENAMEX> when they started uh  talking about you know they knew they needed to paint their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and they got some estimates and they were just you know exorbitant
 		so they started going around and and looking at paint colors and they must have looked at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five hundred</NUMEX> different paint chips and then they finally settled on white
 	
 	
 		white oh no  oh no
 	
 	
 		uh but you know there again i you can't go wrong with your good basic white
 	
 	
 		yeah i guess i i think i'll go with an off-white
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i'm changing everything so
 	
 	
 		well that was the other thing too after i painted  then i had to go in and uh  change the window treatments because i you know got rid of some old uh uh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">wallpaper</ENAMEX> and you know so it went you know not only the paint but i wound up doing quite a few things so uh and changed out some lighting and and so forth and so on put some dimmers in
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 		yeah it's all challenging that's for sure i've the whole <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> it's taking me to redecorate my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedroom</ENAMEX> and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX>'s bedroom
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but it's pretty i love it i've upholstered walls and made curtains and
 	
 	
 		who did did you do the walls
 	
 	
 		i did yeah um-hum
 	
 	
 		did you really i'm impressed
 	
 	
 		and it looks so nice because you just take sheets and then everything can match
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		and it looks really pretty i love it it's just real feminine and just real pretty
 	
 	
 		yeah i like wall upholstery but uh that's something i would never even dream of
 	
 	
 		so
 		oh it's easy oh if you can do all that you could do walls oh there's nothing to it
 	
 	
 		really
 		huh
 	
 	
 		you can do a wall in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">half an hour</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		you're kidding
 	
 	
 		huh-uh staple <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">gun</ENAMEX> is all it takes
 	
 	
 		oh okay did you put anything behind the sheet
 	
 	
 		i did i put the batting uh-huh and just staple it up there and staple your sheets up and then
 	
 	
 		yeah uh-huh
 		and that's all it is to it
 	
 	
 		yeah and then you can glue a little edge around if you want to like i took some eyelet lace and i just hot glued it around the edge
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well
 	
 	
 		but it's nothing and it's just beautiful i love it
 	
 	
 		well i'll be well i'll have to keep that in mind i i just i don't
