 
     		
 	
 		
 
 		so what did you have done to your <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> last
 	
 	
 		well just fact just recently we're waiting to get it fixed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">right now</TIMEX> it's uh my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX> when it was kind of a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">windy day</TIMEX> she opened the door and it kind of blew it all the way back
 		kind of bent it back up against the front bumper there
 		and so we're trying it it uh broke the uh the hinge that holds the door on onto the car
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and so it has to be rewelded and everything
 		so uh we're waiting to get that repaired you know repaired and they have to weld it and touch up some of the paint and everything
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		as for maintenance and stuff that i do i i i kind of don't don't do any my on on my own i other than waxing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> and kleeping it clean but usually i go to like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jiffy Lube</ENAMEX> and have them do the uh the oil change and the lubrication and such
 	
 	
 		yeah that's really dirty work isn't it
 	
 	
 		yeah  how about you
 	
 	
 		oh i'm a single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> so i have most of mine done and i my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> died <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX>  and i went down and priced the new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> and there was no way i could afford a new car
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh did it
 		right
 	
 	
 		so i just i went and had mine rebuilt i had a rebuilt engine put in it and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the week</TIMEX> after that the transmission went out so i had to put a transmission transmission in it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but
 		it's running pretty good <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">now</TIMEX> after i had all that done
 	
 	
 		gosh what kind is it
 	
 	
 		it's a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lincoln</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um ours is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh Voyager Plymouth Voyager</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so and i really like that but that's about it i mean i don't do i used to i used to have a uh when i was single  and i had a a uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mustang</ENAMEX> a fast you know an old Mustang <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixty five</TIMEX> i used to do everything a lot of things you know i'll do all the oil changes and the tune-ups and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh you know making it fast and putting carburetors and everything like that on it and uh i used to do all that but since since then really no since i got married actually
 		and just find it easier to go to one of these uh you know fast places like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jiffy Lube</ENAMEX> or someplace like that
 	
 	
 		is it that you don't have the time to work on it like you'd like to or you're just tired of it after doing it for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">so many years</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah that's that's pretty much
 		no it's actually it's more like i don't have the time you know because we also have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> too and so then i you know i just
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		trying to find time for them and then try to do the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> too i just you know and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and the yard and you know everything else so
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so usually i just uh try to make it as convenient as possible and go to one of those kind of places
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but
 	
 	
 		well being a single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> i can't afford much so i take <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mine</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KMart</ENAMEX> and get the oil changed on it and i get
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i can get by pretty cheap on that and then i have a
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">friend</ENAMEX> that puts my
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">plugs</ENAMEX> in it when i need new spark plugs and so he does that for me and that's that helps me a lot
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh good
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		good deal
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		well i guess that's about it huh
 	
 	
 		yeah i need new i'm putting new tires on it now so yeah
 	
 	
 		oh are you
 		oh yeah we did that too in fact that was that was the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> right before this is uh we had to get some new tires in the back
 		evidently one of the uh the right
 		rear tire had one of the weights fall off it or something
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		and so consequently got a some kind of bubble in what they call out of round or something
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and so you can hear it when you sit in the back you know the thump thump thump thump thump thump and so we had to get a new one
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so that was a recent one too
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and tires aren't cheap
 	
 	
 		well <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car car</ENAMEX> that's a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> is never ending
 	
 	
 		yeah  yeah right
