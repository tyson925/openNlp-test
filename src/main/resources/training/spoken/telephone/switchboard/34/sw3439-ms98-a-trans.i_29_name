 		yes
 	
 	
 		i'm supposed to ask you how do you make use of your credit cards and i'm supposed to compare those with my my habits
 	
 	
 		okay how do i make use of credit cards um
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		let's see i carry a lot of credit cards with me mostly because i don't ever have cash
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and i don't i do you work for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texas Instruments</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		no i do not
 	
 	
 		okay well at <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> we have to use what's called a texteller if we want to get cash out and those are only available at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TI</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		so if i'm in a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mall</ENAMEX> or something i can't get cash out without paying extra money so i'm always using credit cards
 	
 	
 		sure
 		well myself i always try i'm i'm a traveling person
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i'm out of town quite a bit so i use credit cards quite a lot also as far as everything from service work and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gasoline</ENAMEX> in my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> to my lodging entertainment and for everything
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah me too
 	
 	
 		so that's uh as far as using them outside that i'm not i don't use them too much but i don't think i i think my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> is sort of like you she uses a credit card most of the time
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so she does most of the shopping for our household so she'll use them more than i will
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		but do you get to pay the bills
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but so it's me i'm always i'm the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> that always goes to like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dillard's</ENAMEX> and i'll go in and charge something and and i'll have to give them my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">driver</ENAMEX>'s license they'll have to look up the number because i'm never carrying a credit card
 	
 	
 		same at my house
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh yeah</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but i do carry like my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Express</ENAMEX> and my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Visa</ENAMEX> which i use for you know primarily work type things
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh yeah</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		this is my first call by the way so
 	
 	
 		oh it's mine too yes
 	
 	
 		oh is it really
 		all right so we're both beginners then
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i've had this for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple weeks</TIMEX> and i've been out of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> so this is my <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time to
 	
 	
 		oh okay okay now did you pick this topic or were you given
 	
 	
 		to use it
 		so
 		no i was given this topic
 	
 	
 		i see okay
 	
 	
 		yeah they give you they assign you a topic you call the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight hundred</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">number</ENAMEX> have you tried it yet
 	
 	
 		right
 		no
 	
 	
 		okay when you call the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight eight hundred</NUMEX> number they assign you a topic and uh
 		pretty uh cut and dry
 	
 	
 		huh okay
 		um let's see so how long are we supposed to talk for
 	
 	
 		i'm not sure
 		<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a couple about about two minutes three minutes</TIMEX> i think
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		but i really don't have too much more to say in regards to credit cards i one thing i've always tried to do is when i get my credit cards i always try to pay them off because i just sort of detest paying interest
 	
 	
 		oh yes definitely
 	
 	
 		and uh like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX> my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> and i got married
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		she was the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> with a little better heel than i was because i had my credit cards i think up to the limit and i was giving everyone <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> dollars <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a month</TIMEX> and everything like that but
 	
 	
 		oh
 		that'll cost you a fortune
 	
 	
 		that was like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty years ago</TIMEX> so now it's a little different we i get a bill and i pay it <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the same day</TIMEX> it comes in
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yes yes
 	
 	
 		or at least i try to and i just try to tell my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> how much
 		i hate paying interest so they should follow the same rule
 	
 	
 		that's right well yeah if you pay it that way it i mean it really is it's like getting a free loan for a while
 	
 	
 		oh you bet it's a
 	
 	
 		which is what i do
 	
 	
 		it's an absolute savings
 	
 	
 		or if you travel for work and you get your reimbursement before the bill comes in you get to keep the money
 	
 	
 		you bet
 		that's that's very handy
 	
 	
 		yeah it works great
 	
 	
 		well
 		i think that's all i have
 	
 	
 		okay
 		well it was nice to meet you
 	
 	
 		nice to meet you and uh give it a try i think you'll enjoy it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">okay</ENAMEX> thanks bye-bye
 	
 	
 		okay thank you bye
