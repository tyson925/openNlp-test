 
     		
 	
 		yes we're going there
 	
 	
 		
 
 		on our way
 	
 	
 		well uh this is a good topic for me because i just got off a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jury</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh i'll bet it is a good topic then
 	
 	
 		yeah have you ever been on a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jury</ENAMEX> before
 	
 	
 		i have been on a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jury</ENAMEX> once and it was an experience of a lifetime
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		really what kind of a trial was it
 	
 	
 		it was just a it was like a civil suit um and i really felt that by the end of it i had no respect whatsoever for our jury system
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh really what what did you think was wrong with it
 	
 	
 		yep it
 		well we all had to agree it well we didn't all have to agree because it was a civil suit
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> out of twelve had to agree and we had like twelve questions and the exact same <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> had to agree on all twelve questions
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and that's really hard i mean we deliberated for  <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">ten hours</TIMEX> and that was a long time and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> got  with each other and i mean it just was not a good situation
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		wow
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		hm that's interesting
 	
 	
 		well and you know by the end of it i didn't feel like anybody won i feel like we compromised  compromised until we got to the point that nobody won
 	
 	
 		really
 		wow that's
 	
 	
 		what about yours
 	
 	
 		well i've been on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> actually and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> one i was on was also a civil trial but it was real apparent to all of us what what the situation was so it was real simple
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">um</ENAMEX> and we only deliberated as maybe <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three hours</TIMEX> and we weren't really deliberating we were reading through the whole charge
 		and and trying to understand what the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> had written but i mean beyond that we really didn't have much debate um but the one i just got off of was capital murder trial
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		and uh that uh um i don't know if it's fortunate or not i was an alternate so i sat through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five days</TIMEX> of the trial and it's sort of like seeing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five days</TIMEX> of a movie and missing <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the last ten minutes</TIMEX> because i don't know what happened yet
 	
 	
 		oh because you weren't allowed to go into deliberations were you
 	
 	
 		and
 		that's right that's right and they also they can't report it on TV or anything so i don't know you know until it's completely over i won't know what happened
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		so it was it was really interesting and and i can see
 	
 	
 		are are you real definite as to how you think you would have voted and everything
 	
 	
 		i i was leaning one way or another but i really needed to look at some of the evidence to make sure
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but it it you know it was fairly clear and i talked to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> afterwards and you know and knowing what i know know now which the other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">jurors</ENAMEX> didn't know i'd definitely convict the guy
 		because he was he was found involved in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> more of them and he was caught on the scene a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the third one</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		so it was it was fairly obvious you know that he had done it and eventually i'm sure one of the in one of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> trials they'll probably convict him if not the first but uh
 	
 	
 		but is this one <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the first</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		this is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> one they tried him on yes so it was it was
 	
 	
 		wow
 		where are you from
 	
 	
 		um i'm in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Dallas</ENAMEX> where are you
 	
 	
 		oh okay Plano
 	
 	
 		oh okay well this happened in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Plano</ENAMEX>  you'll be thrilled to know
 	
 	
 		
 
 		what trial are you talking about
 	
 	
 		excuse me
 	
 	
 		what trial are you talking about
 	
 	
 		um well the one i was involved was at uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Warehouse Beverage</ENAMEX> it's on uh i think it's <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Fifteenth</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avenue K</ENAMEX> and the one he was later involved in was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texaco</ENAMEX> one
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i don't know what the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> one was
 	
 	
 		oh my well i'll have to watch the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> then when did they go into when did they go into deliberations
 	
 	
 		but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texaco</ENAMEX> one
 		yeah that
 		on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX> but that was just the the guilt and innocence phase and i don't know you know then there is the punishment phase after that
 	
 	
 		oh
 		now is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jury</ENAMEX> going to decide the punishment phase
 	
 	
 		um well all they can decide they don't really tell say we want capital punishment or we want something or life imprisonment
 		you know if they find him guilty those are the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> options for capital murder but they had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six six</NUMEX> choices what he was guilty of uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but all they can do there is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> questions that they have to evaluate one being could he be a future threat to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> well he's already proven that
 		but you know a couple questions like that and your answers are yes or no and if you get i think it is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> yeses it's capital punishment
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		or you can decide if there is mitigating fact or something to that effect but it's not like you go and say you know we we recommend this punishment you just say we answered these questions this way
 	
 	
 		wow
 		and that's what it that's what it leads to
 	
 	
 		and it leads you to the punishment yeah
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		so it was really interesting and i wish i knew if they were still in deliberations but i don't
 	
 	
 		um
 		well it is it  when did you say it was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		so
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX> they went into deliberations but i don't know if the press can report at the end of the  the guilt and innocence phase or if they have to wait until the whole punishment thing is over because that will take <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">another couple weeks</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday Sunday Monday</TIMEX> um
 		i don't know wow
 	
 	
 		so but it was it was really interesting
 	
 	
 		
 
 		so you enjoyed yours then
 	
 	
 		well i it i learned a lot what i didn't enjoy was not being able to plan anything in my whole life because i mean as far as i knew this could take <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> some of them do
 	
 	
 		right
 		oh yeah some of them do
 	
 	
 		and that was the thing you know with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> and everything and i couldn't make reservations to go home but uh
 		you know now that it's over it was really interesting
 	
 	
 		who is the judge
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">um Nathan</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nathaniel White</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		Nathaniel
