 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		um do you golf yourself or are you a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spectator</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		well no i i try
 	
 	
 		you try
 	
 	
 		my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> and i uh took it up <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year last summer</TIMEX> so
 	
 	
 		oh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		we try and it it we really enjoy it we're having a having a good time although can be rather frustrating  how about you
 	
 	
 		do you
 		did you take a class or did you just start
 	
 	
 		um we took a golf <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinic</ENAMEX> there was about i don't know twelve fifteen <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and we took lessons for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about seven weeks</TIMEX> we went once a week and and that's how we got started
 	
 	
 		oh that
 		oh that probably helped a lot i'm more of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spectator</ENAMEX> i i have been a couple of times with my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> but i
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um i'm more of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spectator</ENAMEX> my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> have a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cabin</ENAMEX> and it's right on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">fifteenth hole</ENAMEX> of a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">golf course</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh how nice
 	
 	
 		it is and we just love to sit and watch the the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> golf it's it's fun  to see them i i enjoy looking at
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		noticing different golf <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX> and the way they're set out you know the the layout and are some of them harder than others or
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh yeah definitely
 	
 	
 		they're
 		do they have so they do they name the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">golf courses</ENAMEX> like this is a you know beginning one intermediate or
 	
 	
 		you know i've never really heard of it but they do something called the slope rating
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i'm not into it that much to really know but i think that has something to do with how easy or how hard the course is
 	
 	
 		oh oh
 	
 	
 		um uh my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> has talked about it and i'm just kind of like okay whatever  so i'm not really sure or not but i think that's how they rate the the different courses
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh so now when you go do you take a caddy or do you just go yourself or
 	
 	
 		oh no we go ourselves a lot of time we'll walk just to get in the exercise uh depending on how the weather is if it's too hot or something then we'll then we'll ride but we we just like you know getting outdoors and
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and walking around and playing and
 	
 	
 		spending the time together probably
 	
 	
 		yes and that's something that that's a sport that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> could do together
 	
 	
 		oh yeah do you
 	
 	
 		so we we you ought to take it up it really is a lot of fun
 	
 	
 		it looks fun and it doesn't look that difficult i mean i'm sure that's what everybody says that hasn't tried it
 	
 	
 		yeah well you know you sit there and watch the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pros</ENAMEX> on TV and it's like oh they make it look so easy and you're going oh i can go out and do that and then you get out there and it's kind of a different story
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh well that's what i i noticed uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">golf course</ENAMEX> that we watch most the times they have you know the sand traps and the little lakes and there's a a river going through the middle of it and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i think <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> i in fact we do find a lot of golf balls  off to the side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> that have been hit off you know and and that's fun we enjoy walking looking for the golf
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		golf balls now how long does it take to to to play a round of golf
 	
 	
 		usually if you're gonna play eighteen holes it usually takes <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about four hours</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		a lot of times um you know you've got groups in front of you and sometimes you have to wait and and that kind of thing so it you know it can take take a long time
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		do you usually play <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the full eighteen</TIMEX> rounds or do you just do the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> or
 	
 	
 		sometimes we do <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> it just kind of depends if we decide to go out you know in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the afternoon</TIMEX> and just want to go and play <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> then we'll do that but usually we play eighteen
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh so would you recommend taking a class before you just go out on the course and try and try and start golfing
 	
 	
 		yeah probably so just so that you know you know the courtesy and and get at least the basics down so you feel a little bit confident because i know the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time i went out to play i waited until i took all the lessons
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i was i was so embarrassed because i thought oh i'm gonna be holding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> up behind me and they're gonna be laughing and
 	
 	
 		oh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know you just i guess you just get nervous and then after you've been out a few times you just say
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh well  you kind of get used to it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh so do you have your own <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clubs</ENAMEX> or do you you each have your own set of clubs
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah we each have our own <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clubs</ENAMEX> when we took our lessons the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">instructor</ENAMEX> provided <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clubs</ENAMEX> for us because which was really good
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		because you know when you're just starting out you don't know what type of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clubs</ENAMEX> to use you know what's the best for you and so there's no sense in buying a set and then finding out later that you really should be using something else
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 		no
 		uh-huh well that's my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> he took a class in college and he really enjoyed it and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i've since thought about buying him some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clubs</ENAMEX> but i don't know the first thing about it you know and i wouldn't even know where to begin whether
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well you can go to you know a golf <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX> or something that's what we did when we went to go look for them and they helped us out a lot
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh to tell you the lengths to get and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and the different type of oh well that's interesting huh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		so that that helps
 	
 	
 		boy i'll say yeah because i like i say i don't even know where to where to start what to do but i guess that's i'm sure there's books and
 		on on <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">golf</ENAMEX> that you could read too so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so do you have a favorite course that you usually go to or do you
 	
 	
 		well we have we have one that it's not our favorite <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> but it
