 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		so how many um credit cards do you have
 	
 	
 		um
 		i think i'm down to one
 	
 	
 		oh my gosh i wish i was that way is that why you said i had more experience than you
 	
 	
 		well no i was pulling your leg
 	
 	
 		oh well how how do you use your credit card i mean do you just keep it in reserve or
 	
 	
 		i i well the way i'd like to try and use it is um
 		you you you make your purchases at at prime buying time
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and then you pay that off and don't use it until uh
 		it's paid off
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		that's that's my ideal way
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		how how do you use it
 		
 
 	
 	
 		emergencies come along and i  and i use it
 	
 	
 		yeah that's understandable exactly
 	
 	
 		uh like uh
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> uh had a major problem and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">seven hundred dollars</NUMEX> and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		right right
 	
 	
 		uh
 		things just come up and you just never get to use it the way you'd really like to
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		um-hum well actually i do have quite a few more credit cards than you have um
 		and i use them you know like my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Express</ENAMEX> i use for you know gas things like that and i pay that off <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</TIMEX> and then um some other credit cards like store credit cards you know i do have them up there a little bit but uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i try not to use them too often
 		but living in this area and like i live <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">fifteen miles</NUMEX> west of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DC</ENAMEX> it's a very expensive area  so
 	
 	
 		hm
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		sometimes you have no other choice if you need to buy something
 	
 	
 		yeah well i i know i was uh up in there had a lot of credit cards and
 		i was just starting to get to where it was
 		getting me in trouble so we just
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		disposed of them paid them off and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		got out of it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well that was good that you had the opportunity to do that
 	
 	
 		i just
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um-hum now are you married that you both you and your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> use a credit card or
 	
 	
 		well i just
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		well now we pretty much just pay cash for
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh</ENAMEX> hm
 	
 	
 		as much as we can there
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		our our only credit card is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sears</ENAMEX> so
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh</ENAMEX> hm
 	
 	
 		and i have that for automotive purposes
 	
 	
 		right
 		right well well that's great um everyone i know here uses um credit cards like they're going out of business to be honest with you
 	
 	
 		hm yeah
 		yeah it's it's just too easy
 		basically uh just
 		get yourself in trouble with those
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		yeah the only other one i have i have like a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diner's Club</ENAMEX> through my um where i work
 	
 	
 		i see
 	
 	
 		so that i use uh because i travel some so i use that and i don't really have to worry about that because i only use it for business so i automatically have the money to pay it off
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but hm
 	
 	
 		uh i wouldn't mind uh you know getting back into one if they would you know you start out at a low limit and then they just keep wanting you to increase your limit
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and and if i can get one that'll keep my limit at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five hundred</NUMEX> and i can never go over that or something like that then that's fine but they
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		eventually get's up there to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five thousand ten thousand</NUMEX> whatever fifty thousand  forget it i don't want that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 		um  the temptation's too great
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		so
 		i don't know just uh
 		writing checks is just as easy i guess
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true
 		that's true
 		but
 		so i guess uh we've kind of exhausted this uh topic
 	
 	
 		yeah well really what what can you
 	
 	
 		yeah you can't say too much about it really
 	
 	
 		other than you use them or you don't use them you like them or you don't like them so
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i guess uh they don't care care if we end it early so
 		uh
 		hopefully uh you have a good <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thanksgiving</TIMEX> that's coming up and
 	
 	
 		okay you too
 	
 	
 		and then uh maybe we'll talk again
 	
 	
 		yeah maybe you're the furthest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> actually that i've talked i've talked to a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> is the big one
 	
 	
 		yeah so
 	
 	
 		okay then well bye now
 	
 	
 		okay
 		okay bye-bye
