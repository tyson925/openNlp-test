 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
  
 		okay let's see um
 		when i was working i would wear um comfortable
 		casual type clothes nothing real dressy but um  mostly um i do like to wear shirts that are kind of longer and um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		not real high high shoes i would say more
 	
 	
 		more flats with low heels
 	
 	
 		more more flat kind of shoes and something that would be comfortable to wear throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> nothing that would be too dressy
 	
 	
 		well i work in an office so i wear a lot of suits and but my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shoes</ENAMEX> are lower heels i'm not able to wear high heels
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh i wear but right now it's kind it's real casual in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> because we're getting ready for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this holiday</TIMEX> and and we're wearing pants and sweaters
 	
 	
 		which is nice that's that's
 	
 	
 		a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> wear jeans but i just i don't approve of that in a office
 	
 	
 		um-hum i felt the same way well i work in a private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">high school</ENAMEX> and i always felt like i had to dress i dress casually but yet i dress a little bit
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		dressy i dress totally dressy compared to what the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> came in to what the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> looked like you know i had to
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		well you're an example for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> then
 	
 	
 		right so i had this and real conservative my taste runs real conservative i like white blouses with little <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Pan</ENAMEX> collars and sweaters and cardigans and turtlenecks and just kind of um
 		just very conservative kind of traditional clothes and nothing
 		nothing at all faddish i don't i get suits or dresses that i have that i had <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several years</TIMEX> that i can pull out of my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">closet</ENAMEX> and they will still be in style just as they were when i <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> bought them
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		oh that's good that's good uh-huh that's the kind to get
 	
 	
 		you know that kind of stuff
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		kind that's in style for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a long time</TIMEX> that's the kind i have too
 	
 	
 		yeah and just
 		just um
 	
 	
 		i like a lot of color though too
 	
 	
 		i do too i do too a lot of
 	
 	
 		i like the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peaches</ENAMEX> and the
 	
 	
 		um-hum well i have uh dark hair so i do like to wear the real bright i like bright bright royal blues and bright reds on on on me
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and that's kind of nice especially for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the holidays</TIMEX> it's fun to dress with all the bright colors
 	
 	
 		right
 		well i have light hair it's a kind of a reddish blonde so i wear the bright blues too and the
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh but i can't wear red red's just too much
 	
 	
 		no
 		too much for you uh-huh huh okay  um-hum
 	
 	
 		but i like the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peaches</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">greens</ENAMEX> and the blues and
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		and um let's see what was the question did we supposed to come
 	
 	
 		the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seasons</TIMEX> the colors in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seasons</TIMEX> there's
 	
 	
 		okay
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i like the darker colors in the fall the browns and the
 	
 	
 		yes now browns i stay away from browns because i have dark eyes and dark hair so for for me
 	
 	
 		oh okay well see i wear a lot of those i like a lot of brown
 	
 	
 		a lot of those who look pretty shirt um-hum
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		that that i have a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">a little</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three year old</TIMEX> that has very blonde <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hair</ENAMEX> and i dress her with different colors that i never get to wear like the bright
 		the bright um she looks really pretty in yellow just like a real bright lemon yellow and um certain colors like that and she um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i'll put on her and they look real cute  um that's it well
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah well i like a lot of nice i wear a lot of nice clothes too of course they are expensive it takes money to dress nice now
 	
 	
 		well that's the that's the problem i think it's you know the way you would like to dress and the way you could afford to dress is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different
 	
 	
 		well when you work
 		yeah
 		when you work a lot of your money goes to your clothes because you're trying to look nice like everybody else in the office
 	
 	
 		yes
 		that's right  i found that even just working part-time in this uh private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> um it was it it was
 		an expense just to get started to get the clothes after being home with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> and like i said it was real important because i was working around <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teenagers</ENAMEX> and i like you said had to set an example and i
 	
 	
 		that's right that's right
 	
 	
 		well wouldn't have felt comfortable wearing jeans although some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> did once in a while that i don't i very rarely even just wear jeans at home you know i'm not comfortable in them
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well now you could have mixed and matched them did you do that with different skirts and blouses and
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		to make different outfits uh-huh
 	
 	
 		yes that that is a big consideration if i have a a solid <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">navy</ENAMEX> blue blazer i might you know go ahead and pick up a plaid skirt or something and then maybe a solid whatever to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mix</ENAMEX> and match that
 	
 	
 		yeah you can make
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i sit there and really kind of i really have to take a long time to think about what to to get because like you said you have to
 	
 	
 		can make your wardrobe larger that way by
 	
 	
 		right to make it
 		right and also adding some accessories to different different things i'm not a real um i don't like to wear really big earrings i kind of have a few gold earrings that are my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">favorites</ENAMEX> and just little pearls so i'm really kind of boring in a sense conservative
 	
 	
 		well now the the scarves i didn't really go for the scarves did you
 	
 	
 		
 
 		no they once in a while i'd i'd try <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> on and it would seem right and then
 		before i walked walked out the door i'd have it off because it just didn't feel right
 	
 	
 		yeah i just didn't go for the scarves i don't know
 	
 	
 		i didn't um i didn't like that too much either
 	
 	
 		i knew some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> that they in fact they still
