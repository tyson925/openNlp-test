 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year ago</TIMEX> i changed jobs from being a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researcher</ENAMEX> to doing marketing for the research group
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		which means uh kind of a i guess it's a different
 		set of standards i guess
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so uh i i dress almost the same everyday i mean pretty much it's a white shirt and slacks and shoes and a coat
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but it was very different before how would you dress
 	
 	
 		well i'm a drafter so i just wear blue jeans and tennis shoes and i have a sweatshirt on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>  and that's pretty much the norm for me if i come in in a dress everybody's shocked
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah i understand
 	
 	
 		they ask me you know what are you doing in a dress and it's usually i haven't done my laundry lately  ran out of jeans
 	
 	
 		right
 		i understand that's funny  so does it change
 	
 	
 		no no hum-um
 	
 	
 		your your dress no
 		so or do i guess do you have things like presentations to do or anything like that  so back in my old job up until through nineteen eighty i would
 	
 	
 		no hum-um
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		usually wear blue jeans and pullover shirts and the like but  probably once <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a month</TIMEX> or so there was some reason that i would have to put on a suit
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		presentation customer presentation or something
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah  every <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">now</TIMEX> and then i'll get dressed up and come in but that's for my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>'s job and not mine i have to go to a business meeting once a month with him but
 	
 	
 		oh i see i understand
 		uh oh well that's interesting
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		let's see uh what else about this
 		hm
 		it it seems like <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> is pretty cut and dried with the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two like two or three</NUMEX> levels that there's the top upper management that always wears gray suits
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that don't uh i don't know if you noticed if i wanna say don't have power or don't have authority or whatever like i used to be in that research and i guess you are that we dress in the jeans and then there's kind of the
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		the branch <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> level or marketing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that kind of do that middle thing
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah yeah middle middle of the road
 	
 	
 		but there's not much it's nice that there's not a requirement
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum  sometimes i think there should be some of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> around here look like they came off of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harry Hines</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		for it
 		oh yeah right yeah i guess you see those once in a while
 	
 	
 		and you know the they have the no shorts deal and some of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mini skirts</ENAMEX> you know are worse than shorts ever thought about being but um
 	
 	
 		sure
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know that's i guess that's one of the things you got to put up with when you don't have a dress code
 	
 	
 		that's right that's right i guess that that isn't there a dress code something about <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spaghetti straps</ENAMEX> i'm not even sure what they are
 	
 	
 		supposedly and backless things but i've seen those too
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		oh backless all right
