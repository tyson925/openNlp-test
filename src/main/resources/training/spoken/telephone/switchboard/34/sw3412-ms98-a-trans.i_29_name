 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay uh i guess uh
 		you have any uh favorite foods
 	
 	
 		well i like to eat um i like to bake a lot i'm not a gourmet cook but um  just enjoy a lot of old-fashioned cooking
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah i i used we used to get the uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gourmet</ENAMEX> and uh
 		stuff like that uh i i did try
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 	
 	
 		a few of the the recipes in there and
 	
 	
 		well how did those those turn out
 	
 	
 		uh well i made a a um
 		a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bread pudding</ENAMEX> uh
 		fancy style and it came out really good
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		well that sounds good my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> takes the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Gourmet um</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bon Appetite</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah uh
 	
 	
 		a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> and he has prepared several dishes uh  and they've turned out really well one of those is uh was  i don't even i don't even know what the name of the recipe is to this point but
 		um
 		it was just beef cooked with a a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> and and uh all kinds of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spices the rosemary</ENAMEX> and those kind of things and it turned out really really well
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		i see yeah i i do a lot of i did i've done some uh you know things like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chicken</ENAMEX> and and stuff in there but i
 		i deviate from it i i never like to follow  sometimes if there's something uh in there that i i don't like i'll substitute it with something else and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and so uh i like to experiment
 	
 	
 		well
 		well i do too uh in fact uh lot of times i will just
 		uh decide on a a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meat</ENAMEX> and then just put some things around it add some gravies or or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">um uh sauces</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		the the thing i've found that's bad about that if i don't write it down while i'm being creative
 		and it turns out wonderfully a lot of times the next time i think about it i don't have that recipe in mind i can't exactly remember exactly how i fixed it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so i've learned that when i am creative like that that i try and make sure i write that down
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um one of the things that i have had a lot of fun doing is collecting recipes uh well not really a i don't have lots but i have
 		collected a few recipes from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> and uh we have um
 		i don't know what part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> you're from in but i'm in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i'm in the northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">area</ENAMEX> up here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wisconsin Minnesota</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		okay well i'm in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas Texas</ENAMEX> and um here for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> we've had a waffle shop
 		downtown it's closed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">now</TIMEX> but they had famous waffles and i happen to have
 		that recipe right in front of me which is really um
 		doesn't look like a heart healthy recipe at all but it's delicious if you're into waffles
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh well i i like waffles but i usually go to restaurant and eat them
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i uh
 		i don't even have a waffle iron
 	
 	
 		well  you need one of those for sure but it has um  like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk</ENAMEX> and it has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half half</NUMEX>-and-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> in it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh  course real <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">butter</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		i like all those things that aren't good for you
 	
 	
 		the me too me too and i'm beginning to show it too
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah i uh i mean we we do use a lot of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the margarines</TIMEX> and that but i do miss actual butter
 	
 	
 		um-hum i don't uh use <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">butter</ENAMEX> unless i do some special things uh usually around the holidays
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		and i tend to um
 		feel like i can justify use the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">butter</ENAMEX> during that time uh not only just you know to put into the recipes but to serve on the table too
 	
 	
 		yeah well i i know it's something that my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> picked up was uh we uh made some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">um butter</ENAMEX> from uh you just take heavy whipping cream
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and you keep churning it until it turns to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">butter</ENAMEX> so
 	
 	
 		well i've done that a couple of times not on purpose
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i did that by accident a couple of times one of the things that i think i'm going to try this um
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX>  <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thanksgiving</TIMEX> is i um i've talked to a a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gentleman</ENAMEX> who prepares turkeys by deep frying them have you heard of that
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		he deep fries the turkeys whole in a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peanut oil</ENAMEX>
 		and he says that um and i haven't tasted them um but he claims that they are juicy and just very very good
 		um he prepares
 		he can prepare up to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a thirty two pound</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">turkey uh</ENAMEX> with the method that that he uses which is just a big vat with you know lots and lots of the the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peanut oil</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so i think that i think that's um
