 
     		
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">okay Mike</ENAMEX> i guess we'll be talking about painting recently any of kind of recent painting you've done uh yourself have you done any recently
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well we um remodeled a bathroom
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and which required uh completely repainting the bathroom
 		and the other project we've done around here is uh we've remodeled all our all our closets
 	
 	
 		wow wow that's that's quite a chore
 	
 	
 		which required quite a bit of painting
 	
 	
 		yes i imagine it did did you have that done professionally or did you do that yourself
 	
 	
 		no we did it ourselves did it myself
 	
 	
 		you enjoy that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		oh that's that's fun we just recently uh had our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX>' room our <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> oldest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> share a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> and
 		they're uh the paint has uh kind of faded and deteriorated and so we decided to paint their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> and put up wallpaper and border and so forth
 		and uh looks quite good we were quite pleased with the result
 	
 	
 		is this a project you did yourself
 	
 	
 		yes it's a project uh that i did yes and and uh
 	
 	
 		what what what brought about the fading of the paint
 		just sun exposure
 	
 	
 		well
 		i don't think it's sun exposure but um
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> will be <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> and there there were crayon marks on there and we had to to scrub the crayon marks off of course try and get it clean
 	
 	
 		oh okay yeah
 		latex paint latex
 	
 	
 		and so pardon me yes it was it was latex paint and that's uh what we put back on there was a latex paint
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		plus uh they had bunk beds and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> one of the younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> when he was younger <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about three years old</TIMEX> got a uh got a nice marker and got up on the ceiling and decided to draw pictures
 	
 	
 		on the ceiling
 	
 	
 		so  yes on the ceiling and uh you scrub and you scrub but you can't it all off
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		no that's true
 	
 	
 		and so that's one of the reasons why we painted and uh
 	
 	
 		did you go what what kind of paint do you use on the ceiling
 	
 	
 		we used a flat latex paint and in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedroom</ENAMEX> as i understand that's uh one of the better type of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">paints</ENAMEX> to have because it's not so reflective and and glossy colored
 	
 	
 		okay
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and it uh turned out real real well
 	
 	
 		seems like um i've we've done some remodeling of some uh rental <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> that we have
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and it appears as though that uh oh in the fifties or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixties</TIMEX> when some of these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> were built
 		uh they used a lot of uh semigloss type enamel for ceiling paints
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and that was a little difficult to cover with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">paints</ENAMEX> it seemed like
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		we had a occasion uh where we had to do some sealing
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		of uh
 		the ceiling of the this type of paint before we could paint it
 	
 	
 		oh you had to prime it and and seal cover over it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		you had pretty good luck with one coat type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">paints</ENAMEX> you use a particular brand or anything
 	
 	
 		well i like to use this this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sears</ENAMEX> uh the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten year</TIMEX> guarantee or the fifteen year guarantee yes
 	
 	
 		weather beater type stuff yeah
 	
 	
 		and the reason being is once i paint it i don't wanna have to go and do it <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">another five or seven years later</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		understand
 	
 	
 		but uh and uh we're quite satisfied with that and and occasionally you can watch for it and get it on sale
 		and we do do that fact i was just reading an article you mentioned painting your bathroom
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i read an article recently that uh you have to be very careful on the kind of paint you put on the ceiling in your <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bathroom</ENAMEX> because it does tend to
 		to peel or come off because of the moisture high moisture content in your <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bathroom bathroom</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah it's a lot like uh wall paper
 	
 	
 		and uh did you have any problems with that or
 	
 	
 		that's true
 		well the particular bathroom that we did is a half bath so we didn't have a problem with that
 	
 	
 		oh good
 	
 	
 		um
 		i have had i've uh have never experienced that type of a problem
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh with a latex paint
 	
 	
 		oh good neither neither have i
 	
 	
 		so you shouldn't have a you shouldn't have a problem with it
 	
 	
 		oh good
 	
 	
 		they're they're pretty well refined <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> a lot of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">paints</ENAMEX>  and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sears</ENAMEX> is one of the better ones
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah you
 	
 	
 		i've used uh many a gallon of them myself
 	
 	
 		do you uh have you ever used an oil base paint
 	
 	
 		uh used <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil base paints</ENAMEX> for trim
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know like around doors and and on doors things like that
 	
 	
 		why why do you use that i'm i'm kind of learning at this new at this but
 	
 	
 		uh primarily because it seems it seems to be a little more
 		um what do i wanna say
 	
 	
 		it adheres better or lasts <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">longer</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		well not so much that it seems to hold up a little bit better towards the nicks and dings
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		as opposed to uh
 		a latex type paint
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh it just you know it it gives you a a variance even though it's the same color
 	
 	
 		right well that's good that's good
 	
 	
 		so it's worked out pretty well for us
 	
 	
 		um have you ever done any painting outside
 	
 	
 		uh quite a bit painted a couple of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> uh recently <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this summer</TIMEX> we painted a uh out building which is a shed that we have on the property
