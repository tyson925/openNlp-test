 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Susan</ENAMEX> what kind of fishing do you like
 	
 	
 		let's see uh the only kinds i've ever done are just regular you know fishing in the lake or i have actually fished for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Brook Trout</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colorado</ENAMEX> but
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		oh
 	
 	
 		i've always wanted to go deep sea fishing but i've never i can't ever get anybody to to go with me
 	
 	
 		yeah you almost need to get several to go it it's so expensive to rent those <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i that's i that's what i hear is you know that you it's not too bad if you can put uh like <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> on a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> then it comes down to not being so expensive
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but i also found out some more about it and i'm not sure i would enjoy it i don't know that i would really like you know fighting with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> for
 	
 	
 		for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">umpteen hours</TIMEX> yeah that you know takes a lot of strength for that
 	
 	
 		<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> you
 		yeah i i
 	
 	
 		i like the kind where i sit on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX> and watch my bobber and when it goes down i pull a fish in
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		that's the kind i like
 	
 	
 		in fact that's the most successful i have ever i mean as far as ever ever catching a big <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> that's how i caught one with
 	
 	
 		um
 		what did you catch
 	
 	
 		um a a bass it was a well see i can't remember if it weighed <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">three and a half pounds or five</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> pounds or
 	
 	
 		well that's a big fish
 	
 	
 		i mean it was you know big i mean it was biggest fish i've ever caught in my life you know
 	
 	
 		that's wonderful
 	
 	
 		i was so excited you know i was like screaming my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> was running you know he saw the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> go flying through the air and
 	
 	
 		i've never caught one yeah
 		oh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		that part of it was kind of
 		i don't know
 	
 	
 		exciting yeah
 	
 	
 		i was fishing with a little light reight weight rod and we'd been fishing down behind there's a place on the back side of this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dam</ENAMEX> of this little lake that we it's a little private lake that we water ski on a lot and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and they have have the water they let water drain off the back side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dam</ENAMEX> through just kind of a
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i don't know it's some kind of a little drain shaft or something and and it makes a pool and then it goes on down the little creek that they dammed up to make the lake in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> place and they were there's a little pond kind of a
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">pool</ENAMEX> of water there that is pretty turbulent and it's usually pretty good fishing and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mom</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> were fishing in there and something kept eating my minnows you know and i was getting real ticked off because i couldn't you know i wasn't catching anything
 	
 	
 		yeah i know
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so i crossed the little <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> that crosses the stream and went stomping down through the woods and where the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">creek</ENAMEX> runs on out there's a big old tree uprooted and laid over lengthwise in the water and i
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		thought to myself you know i mean this creek is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about five feet</NUMEX> across max and i thought you know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i bet you at the end of those roots there might be something and so i had my little you know i couldn't cast because the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>'s hanging over and brush and everything so i just kind of
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		held the bobber in my hand and flipped it out there in in and amongst the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> roots
 		and it kind of went around in a circle and then it kind of went right below the water and then it went around and then it just went whom altogether out of sight altogether so i started reeling you know and it was stripping my line
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		um
 	
 	
 		as i started going i realized i had something bigger than than i was equipped for because i had one of these little ultra light you know kind of casting rods and i was like oh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> so i was reeling for all i was worth and pulling you know pulling on the line with
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		um
