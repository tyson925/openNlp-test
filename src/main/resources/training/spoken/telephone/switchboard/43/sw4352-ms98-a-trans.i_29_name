 				it it fits my needs pretty well it's a um a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh Tempo</ENAMEX>
 			
 			
 				
 			
 			
 				and uh it's sort of you know nice <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> not not really you know huge and and a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tank</ENAMEX> but uh big enough so that you can fit <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in the backseat so you know it's nice when i go places with other people
 			
 			
 				<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 			
 			
 				<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> and uh and there's sort of an ordinary <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> it seems fairly reliable
 			
 			
 				right
 				the i i drive a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Honda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Prelude</ENAMEX> and uh i i drove it when i was in college i drove a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixty eight</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chevy</ENAMEX> Impala
 			
 			
 				how about you
 			
 			
 				and i drove once i got out i i have i work for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX> now so i have a real job
 			
 			
 				oh
 			
 			
 				and i
 				and i my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> kept telling me that i could afford a better car but they said but i was happy with my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Impala</ENAMEX> so i drove that for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about three years</TIMEX> till it completely died and then i got the Prelude
 			
 			
 				
 			
 			
 				and i think if i were to buy another car right now i think i'd buy another Prelude i really like it
 			
 			
 				yeah they're they're pretty nice they're kind of sporty right i if i have the right thing pictured yeah
 			
 			
 				
 				uh-huh yeah it's a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> door
 			
 			
 				if i i suppose if i was going out and buying a new car i might
 				possibly buy something like that um
 				but you know i'm i'm pretty happy with what i have now as i said  the other the other kind of thing a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> of mine just got a new car got a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Explorer</ENAMEX>
 				and they're kind of neat <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> although they have their draw backs i mean they're they're you know they're kind of big and whatever but uh when it comes to sort of um
 				you know moving stuff around which i find myself doing fair amounts since i tend to sort of move about twice <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> at this point um that kind of thing thing would be very handy um
 			
 			
 				right
 			
 			
 				but uh yeah i don't again i don't really have any uh you know strong preferences when i bought my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> uh you know the major criteria was that it uh
 				you know be something that was rated fairly good for reliability um
 				and uh you know not too expensive and you know decent looking but uh
 			
 			
 				right
 			
 			
 				and i i ended up getting a a pretty good deal on the car i got and i'm i'm very  happy with it it's not it's not you know i suppose if i'd the maximum reliability i would've gotten from a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> but um they also sell for much more especially used
 			
 			
 				
 			
 			
 				and i sort of decided that it probably wasn't worth the price difference but uh you know even if i did occasionally spend a little more for repairs
 				but uh it would probably work out now buying it new i don't know if that's true uh you know it probably isn't worth it more hm
 			
 			
 				so you went with the import you went with the import on based on that
 			
 			
 				no i didn't that's a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> yeah i didn't i mean i i would say they probably are a little bit more reliable but at least on the used car market i think that's uh
 			
 			
 				oh you didn't
 			
 			
 				that's factored into the price already and i don't i'm not i don't think it's worth the added price you pay i mean if you're going for like um
 			
 			
 				oh i see
 			
 			
 				you know say a a you know <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five year old</TIMEX> car um given with for given amount of mileage the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> car'll be
 				going for a lot more money generally yeah and especially this one thing i was kind of appalled at is <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> would be selling uh
 			
 			
 				you're gonna pay a lot more for it yeah that's what i found
 			
 			
 				<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> for you know that had say <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred thousand</NUMEX> miles on them and they'd be asking for a lot of money for them like not much less money than i found say the equivalent <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> for with fifty <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">thousand miles</NUMEX> on it or something
 				and you know <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> would say well you know i mean they last <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">forever</TIMEX> and whatever but i
 				i mean i have to be a little bit skeptical i mean maybe it's true but hm
 			
 			
 				they don't last forever they they don't last forever they maybe <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">last twenty percent longer</TIMEX> or something but still
 			
 			
 				yeah i mean any
 				yeah i mean any any car wears out eventually and starts to have problems so i i knew that you know i definitely i definitely wasn't gonna buy something with you know eighty or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred thousand</NUMEX> miles on it uh if i could avoid it so uh
 			
 			
 				yeah and as happy as i am with my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Honda</ENAMEX> i have had problems with it
 			
 			
 				really i'm surprised
 			
 			
 				yeah i mean i haven't had serious problems with it but it's got <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred thousand</NUMEX> miles on it now so i you know i replaced the clutch and timing chain
 			
 			
 				oh okay well that's see yeah that's
 				
 				yeah i've heard is it the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hondas</ENAMEX> where you have to replace the timing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> or the valves can get damaged or something like that
 			
 			
 				i don't know i've heard that with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Honda</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Honda</ENAMEX>'s it's pretty natural it's pretty normal to need a new timing belt after i think think <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">seventy seventy thousand miles</NUMEX>
 			
 			
 				it's one of the
 				did yours actually fail on you or did you have it replaced as sort of a preemptive
 			
 			
 				no i did my clutch and they said you want us to replace the timing belt while we're in there and i said nah
 				
 			
 			
 				hm
 			
 			
 				now i wish and i wished i had <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later</TIMEX> because i had to go in and uh i couldn't i couldn't move the car i had to go and replace it
 			
 			
 				okay
 				yeah i think yeah i kind i think i remember it hearing that either the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hondas</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toyotas</ENAMEX> um
 				that if the timing belt went
 				in in under like circumstances you know i guess would it'd be while the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> was running and maybe some you know certain speeds or whatever that it could cause the uh cause fairly serious engine damage
 			
 			
 				huh
 			
 			
 				i could be wrong about that it is something i just vaguely remember hearing
 			
 			
 				that i haven't heard
 			
 			
 				um yeah but i i could be wrong about that but yeah i mean i would say in general you know probably although it's
