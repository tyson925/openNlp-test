 
     		
 	
 		before the one will take um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay let's see i guess um
 		i can start i'm actually we're actually trying to find one now because our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>'s growing yeah
 	
 	
 		are you really
 	
 	
 		um
 		so i'm looking at um something larger than what we have we've got like an <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eighty four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Charger</ENAMEX> that's about gone and a uh an <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eighty nine</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Horizon</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh-huh which are both kind of small
 	
 	
 		so i'm looking for something a little bigger yeah um
 		so we were thinking minivan for a while and uh we're looking at uh some just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some four</NUMEX> door <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> passenger <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">sedans</ENAMEX> as well
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh</ENAMEX> are you looking for an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> or you you open to buying foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um i don't really have a preference either way i guess it you know it's
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know  i guess the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> had a bad reputation but i haven't had any real substantial problems with the ones i've had
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		right
 		personally i have a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> car right now and i really like it a lot uh i think the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> really build good <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> and i know that kind of rubs against the grain right now in the whole uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know buy <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> keep <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> auto <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> working right now but i feel that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> have really produced a much higher quality product than our uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturers</ENAMEX> have for a while if i were to buy another car i would be uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i would be partial to buying another <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> but i would also look at <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> but when i bought the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> that i bought now i did that also and i just felt that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> was a much better product so if i were
 	
 	
 		yeah i mean even even if it's just little details it seems like uh they you know like uh there's a door seal that  doesn't quite seal and you have to take it back every once in a while and and it's clearly just a a design problem there
 	
 	
 		right
 		right it is um i'm kind of right now the next <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> i buy is gonna be
 		sort of a sports <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> i would really like to have a sports <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> um  i don't really i don't have a family so i don't need a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a minivan</NUMEX> or such to uh  haul <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> around in
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so i'm looking for more a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a two</NUMEX> passenger <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> that uh
 	
 	
 		oh like a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Miata</ENAMEX> or something like that
 	
 	
 		well i like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Miata</ENAMEX> but i don't like it enough to buy it i would buy something actually the the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> that i really like right now is an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eagle Talon</ENAMEX> which is an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> but uh
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		something along that lines
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> because i have a an economy car right now which is okay but uh i think i i'd like to move on to something a little better
 	
 	
 		interesting
 		yeah
 		that's interesting yeah i guess probably the factors we'd use to compare are a little different because i look for you know size and safety and then mileage probably
 	
 	
 		right
 		right that's when i bought the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> that i bought i was looking for mileage and i was looking for uh dependability and something that was going to last <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a long time</TIMEX> i was get that i would get a
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		for the money that i was going to spend that i would get a return that was that was worth that money
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i can i think in terms of computer terminology i look at you know price performance and things like that
 	
 	
 		so
 		right exactly
 	
 	
 		and then a little bit at life expectancy i guess but it you know depends on what you
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		what you pay initially but you know i've got <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred and twenty</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">five thousand miles</NUMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Charger</ENAMEX> actually it was my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> that she brought into the marriage
 	
 	
 		um that's right
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and she got just a commute between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cincinnati</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dayton</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it's you know we we had to replace the friction plate and the transmission at <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">thirty thousand miles</NUMEX> but
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um the other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ninety four thousand</NUMEX> have been just fine with it so
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		but uh
 	
 	
 		uh i've had uh
 		i've had one or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> i think and
 		and they were okay i had a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pontiac</ENAMEX> once and and i never had a problem with it but
 		uh my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> had a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dodge</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> point and i i had driven it a few times and i really did not feel that it that i would buy a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dodge</ENAMEX>  just just from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">well</ENAMEX> actually i had a uh
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dodge Omni</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> point and that was i think what really prejudiced me against <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> was because i did not feel that it was a very quality uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		car
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so i guess you'd have to say if i was looking i would definitely be looking for a foreign car
 	
 	
 		that's interesting
 		but yeah it it's hard to beat some of the uh
 		like i guess we're in particular we're looking at a like a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ninety one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Corsica</ENAMEX> that's uh buy back at a they say <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> sponsored auction but i think they're obliged to have these things because
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hertz</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avis</ENAMEX> and those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX> have it in their contract that they can sell it back to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		after you know it's after they've used it for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six months</TIMEX> and put you know twelve or <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">fifteen thousand miles</NUMEX> on it and you can get those for like <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight thousand</NUMEX> bucks if you
 	
 	
 		right
 		
 
 		which is a good deal
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		because uh i guess um i mean <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">well ninety two</NUMEX>'s granted but the new ones you know <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fourteen</NUMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixteen</TIMEX> is what they go for
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		right
 	
 	
 		on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lot</ENAMEX> so all the depreciation has been taken off and
 		guess the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealer</ENAMEX> comes out okay you know i don't know what kind of i don't know what <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> corporate kind of hit the i don't know what kind of hit they take on it but sounds like everybody's had their chance to make their money off of it
 	
 	
 		yeah that
 		yeah i'm sure they did
 	
 	
 		so but uh i don't know we keep looking at that minivan it's just you know we can get a like a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caravan</ENAMEX> for right twelve <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> but that's a little more than we want to spend right now
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		right
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		uh it's interesting but uh
 		i don't know if if uh it it seems to be
