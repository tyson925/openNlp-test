 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Julie um</ENAMEX> are you in a situation where you'd
 		soon need to deal with uh
 		special care for elderly
 	
 	
 		well i don't know my grandfather
 		is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ninety two</NUMEX> years old
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and he is still living by himself my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother grandmother</ENAMEX> died <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of years ago</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		but he doesn't want to to move away he lives in a lil <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">farmhouse</ENAMEX> on a farm
 		and he recently had to have an operation but he just really doesn't wanna go to a nursing home
 	
 	
 		is he able to uh still do do everything himself pretty well
 	
 	
 		well he was until this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX> he has <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and
 		now i don't really think he's doing that well and my a lot of my aunts and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">uncles</ENAMEX> live near him
 		and i have one <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aunt</ENAMEX> that really looks after him a lot
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but um my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">great-grandfather</ENAMEX> was put in a nursing home when he was
 		a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundred and three</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and um died <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six weeks</TIMEX> after they put him in the home
 	
 	
 		yeah and i'm sure that kind of thing would influence your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandfather</ENAMEX>'s feelings because
 		um i think you know i think for a lot of people it really is the decision of
 		do they still have some of their life left
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and and far as far as i'm sure a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> going into a nursing home is like saying my life is over and i'm just here for the rest of the stay
 		and so i you know  i guess most of the time when i think about somebody going into a nursing home
 		it's more a case of where they are not able to look after their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day-to-day</TIMEX> needs ah they can look after a lot of things but there's some of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day-to-day</TIMEX> needs that they just are not able to deal with physically anymore
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um
 		i know my
 		none of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandparents</ENAMEX> were in a nursing home they generally
 		were able to have someone care for them at home and they died but they were all
 		goodness younger than your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandparents</ENAMEX> like they were in their eighties that type of thing um
 		but i did uh
 		you know i guess uh when i think nursing home i do think of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that are not able to do some take care of themselves physically
 		hum
 	
 	
 		but i just don't think that nursing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> really do a very good job
 	
 	
 		and that's that's difficult part because i think what they ofend get
 		used as is uh
 		almost like a very high level or long-term care for uh similar to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um
 		i know like here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saskatchewan</ENAMEX> we have our
 		hospital care <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">well</ENAMEX> and the care actually for the elderly older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> graded in level in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four</TIMEX> levels
 		and a level <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> type of care would be someone that
 		really requires long-term hospital care ah generally are not able to look after thisselves to very to a very great extent physically
 		often times they even have mental difficulty with senility or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Alzheimer's disease</ENAMEX> or those  or or physical and mental handicaps
 		um you know where they really required
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twenty four</NUMEX> hour supervision of some kind even though it may be minimal
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		but i think  it can be helpful
 		in that uh it gets <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> the level of physical care they need
 		um
 	
 	
 		but i don't i mean at least i mean i think some nursing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> do that but i think a lot of nursing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> really
 		um are guilty of neglect
 	
 	
 		yeah i think and i think it happens more in areas where it's uh
 		i guess uh
 		a broad social medical system where uh
 		you know there's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> medical care and that kind of thing if it it's the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lot</ENAMEX> where it's funded by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>
 		and and i guess that's sort of my lack of understanding i think that a majority of the places in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> um you know there is some government aid available but the majority of it is
 		to the ability of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> to pay
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh if you're not able to look after yourself then you have to rely on
