 
     		
 	
 		what do you think on uh on a scale of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> where would you rate yourself on on gun control
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh
 		one being maximum control or minimal control
 	
 	
 		most and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> being no restrictions at all
 	
 	
 		that well i guess  probably somewhere in the middle i've uh mixed feelings about it
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah i think i'd be be somewhere around a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four or five</NUMEX> myself and yeah it  it seems to me like there's there's
 	
 	
 		uh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's not it's not fair to just kind of do everything all the same with all <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX> because they're not all the same you know
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		like hand <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX> uh assault <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">rifles</ENAMEX> i think are a little bit different than <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">rifles</ENAMEX> and shotguns
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		well um i ours my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> from uh south <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Georgia</ENAMEX> and you know they hunt quite a bit so i i really don't you know <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX> just something that you have  down there and uh
 		uh so i i tend to agree on that you know but uh
 		assault <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">rifles</ENAMEX> you know that's that's  made to
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		made to kill somebody you know
 	
 	
 		and you don't need <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three hundred</NUMEX> rounds a minute to to get hold of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">deer</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		uh
 		yeah so yeah i feel
 	
 	
 		and if you did it really wouldn't be worth eating so  you know
 	
 	
 		yeah right or cleaning
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but
 		uh i i've heard some
 		uh talk about you know having like a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three day</TIMEX> waiting period or something uh if you to try to buy a firearm or something
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i don't i don't have a problem with that you know i think if you've got a if you've got a  history of uh of violent crimes or something then you certainly don't need a
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah that makes sense that that makes a lot of sense i don't see uh
 	
 	
 		hand gun
 	
 	
 		i mean it's not like you're gonna go hey i'll go hunting today
 	
 	
 		uh yeah
 	
 	
 		and and usually if you're gonna go hunting it's pretty <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early in the morning</TIMEX> anyway and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX> is not gonna be open so
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three day</TIMEX> waiting period makes perfect sense to me  i guess the only real questions then is um is gun control does it does it work i mean can you enforce it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well  uh i think it it
 		i mean if you can if you're gonna commit some violent crime and you go and you can get a gun at your leisure then
 		uh to to restrict it would certainly cut down on on that but
 		you know that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> you can get a gun fairly easily i would think i mean i i feel like i could get a gun in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an hour</TIMEX> if i had to you know so uh obviously it's not gonna
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh get rid of all all of your um illegal <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX> out there or or dangerous you know get dangerous <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX> out of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>'s hands but  uh i think it'd help some
 	
 	
 		yeah they don't
 		i guess i mean the only thing that i worry i question is i mean i think if if it was really easy to enforce that it it would be great the only thing that uh that would worry me about it
 		is that the only real way that i know to enforce it is if someone commits a crime while having a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapon</ENAMEX> that's not registered you can tag on a couple of extra years
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but as it is now you put someone in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prison</ENAMEX> and they're out in you know one <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX> the time they were sentenced to anyway
 	
 	
 		yeah no time
 		right
 	
 	
 		so i mean they're not they're not even staying in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prison</ENAMEX> without the extra <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> on there much less i don't think they'd be staying any longer with extra years tagged on there
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah yeah i don't i don't really think uh i mean i think gun control uh to some extent can could help crime situations but  uh i think
 		i personally my personal belief is you know as you commit a crime you know you should be punished and and  and if you know you are not going to get punished or very little punishment then there's no reason not to
 	
 	
 		um-hum i think you might've had the i i guess i mean i'm that's got to be part of gun control but i like the idea of the uh the waiting period because
 		i don't think that i mean i really think that if someone wants to get a gun to commit a crime they're gonna get a gun but uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		if someone is just like all hot and bothered and and ready to go out and and and get someone just because they're all charged up emotionally
 	
 	
 		right yeah
 	
 	
 		that a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three day</TIMEX> waiting period you're not gonna stay that angry for that long
 	
 	
 		yeah usually not
 	
 	
 		least i'm not
 	
 	
 		yeah i i i agree at least you have a little bit of time to think about it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh i think i don't know that accounts for at least some of the shootings that go on so in the heat of the moment just go out and buy a gun right then and
 	
 	
 		yeah
