 
     		
 	
 		what do you do in terms of exercise if anything
 	
 	
 		
  
 		exercising exercising um i play wally uh wally ball are you familiar with that
 	
 	
 		no i'm not
 	
 	
 		i belong to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">club</ENAMEX> uh uh near where i live or uh actually where i work uh in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Salem New Hampshire</ENAMEX> and they uh it's on a racquet ball <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> and you set up a net and you play wally ball
 		it's just like volley ball but with some of the rules of racquet ball in that you can use the walls to help put the ball over or that type of thing
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		uh so it's it's kind of more fast paced than uh volley ball
 	
 	
 		
 
 		how many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> play
 	
 	
 		uh you can play up to uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four or five</NUMEX> on each side
 		which is quite a few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in such a small space
 	
 	
 		i bet
 	
 	
 		um uh but we usually play <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two and two</TIMEX>
 		uh sometimes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three and three</NUMEX> depending on how many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are willing to get up that early since we play before work
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh so we play that a couple of times <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a week</TIMEX> and then i also play pick up games of <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">basketball basketball</ENAMEX> in the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">mornings</TIMEX> as well
 		so uh that's usually the extent of my exercise
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it's kind of crazy
 	
 	
 		well
 		i take a an aerobics class <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three nights</TIMEX> a week
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		and it's at the fitness center i actually work for an electronics <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> but we have a a fitness center
 		at there at the building
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		and i take uh this aerobics <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> which is a great class it's what they call a circuit <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> where you do <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a few minutes</TIMEX> of aerobic exercise and then you break and do some weight work
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		with hand weights and then back to the aerobics and then maybe back to the elastic bands or whatnot but it's it's broken up for an hour
 	
 	
 		now are these is this what they call high impact or is this
 	
 	
 		no no this is low impact this is safe stuff
 	
 	
 		
 
 		now is the high impact really that dangerous for you
 	
 	
 		i i think it is um i took a a high low impact <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> at the local <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Y</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of years ago</TIMEX>
 		and it just seemed like i was on the verge of getting hurt in terms of knees or back or something like that
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		that that's amazing i'd taken some dance courses in in uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> and i don't know it
 		uh they seem like they would be classified as high impact but maybe there was more flow to it so it wasn't so jarring
 	
 	
 		yeah well i think the trouble with high impact aerobics is that it's so jarring and you don't with the low impact you always have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> foot on the floor
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		you can get pretty strenuous doing that sort of stuff
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well see that's the thing i see some of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> doing low impact and i'm like what's the difference  these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are really working up a sweat
 	
 	
 		yeah well i think it has to do with number of feet on the floor and how much bouncing around you do and that sort of thing like the class i'm in now does not do jumping jacks
 	
 	
 		right
 		huh
 		okay
 	
 	
 		but we
 	
 	
 		cause both feet can't be on the floor at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time
 	
 	
 		right but but we certainly get our heart rates up
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		just from the the marching and and all that that we do so
 	
 	
 		which is i guess the whole point of it
 	
 	
 		yeah i think so
 	
 	
 		now they you say do this at work
 	
 	
 		it it's at a fitness <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> that's associated with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> where i work yes
 	
 	
 		do you have to pay to do that or is it part of your benefits
 	
 	
 		uh no i have to pay to join
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		uh but it runs oh i think the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> is
 		let's see i pay <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about ten</NUMEX> dollars <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a month</TIMEX> to be a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of this fitness
 		center
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		and and there are all sorts of opportunities available there in term you know any anything from chess <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clubs</ENAMEX> to flying clubs  you think
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and uh then it's <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">an extra forty dollars</NUMEX> for an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eight weeks</TIMEX> aerobics class
 		and i think it's pretty competitive with most health most health <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> and they they have a swimming pool and a gym and all kinds of
 	
 	
 		huh
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		of all kinds of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Nautilus</ENAMEX> equipment
 	
 	
 		i was going to say do they have the free weights circuit and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Nautilus</ENAMEX> circuit and all those things
 	
 	
 		yes i i did some of that
 		but it the time it takes is just
 	
 	
 		exactly
 	
 	
 		it uh i don't know once i i get through with the aerobics session i'm ready to go home and eat dinner or something
 	
 	
 		
 
 		so you so you exercise in the evenings
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		that's interesting uh i i don't know it my schedule i guess is more i get up at about uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five thirty</TIMEX> and then i go and play wally ball from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six thirty</TIMEX> to say eight
 		and then i uh shave and shower and do that stuff uh at the gym and then i'm at work at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eight thirty</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so it's all kind of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">in the in the in the morning</TIMEX>
 		but by the end by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> i'm like ugh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		or depending on how the game went it could be like that right after uh right in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX> getting to work
 	
 	
 		yeah well
 	
 	
 		so it it's interesting a different schedule um uh you don't feel more tired toward i guess well i guess you would
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> going home for dinner and then you're uh and then you're uh i i'm sure zonked
 	
 	
 		well the advantage is sometimes i'm too tired to eat
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		now i mean they really offer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX> in the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">mornings</TIMEX> and there's even <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">noon</TIMEX>
 		but i can't really see breaking up <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the middle of the day</TIMEX> going off and doing aerobics taking a shower getting back to work
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		no i know some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who do that as well and i can't understand that either i mean you know i in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX> i come to uh uh work with uh wet hair and you know and kind of uh not breathless but just
