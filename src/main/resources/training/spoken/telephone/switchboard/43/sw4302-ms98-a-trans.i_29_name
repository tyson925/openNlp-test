 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay i guess they're
 	
 	
 		okay
 		so uh you go first yeah
 	
 	
 		okay um
 		
  
 		i guess i um
 		haven't really thought about it for a while i guess um
 		the uh job part of the one i have now there is a
 		requirement that kind of came in after the fact that does since they have contracts one of their uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> they contract with required it and uh
 		you know by then it was it was kind of uh um
 		you know they didn't explain up front that that might be a requirement but it sounded like it was kind of sprung on them by the uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX> they had contracts with
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh but it's it's not something i
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		think is appropriate i guess there might be exceptions you know if if you're in a critical position like you're a traffic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">controller</ENAMEX> or something like that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but um it should
 		it it seems like uh
 		i guess the employer uh
 		is just
 		i think a massing too much information there's it's just an intrusion into
 		uh kind of your personal life
 	
 	
 		right yeah that that that's how i feel i feel the um the employee um the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employer</ENAMEX> has concern about you know what's going on in my body to the degree that it affects how i am doing my job and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um there are lots of factors that affect how i do my job i i don't personally take any <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> but you know that's one factor that could affect something an employee's performance
 	
 	
 		right
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		there are plenty of other factors like i know for me how much sleep i got you know what i ate for breakfast those things have a lot big impact on how i perform during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the day</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and unless they're they want to get involved in all these other areas also
 		you know like maybe providing healthy meals healthy breakfast for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> or something like that you know i mean i i
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh that's you know that's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> step and it what it is what they're getting into is the drug testing is a real quick and easy way and politically
 		um feasible way of going about this because you know everybody is going to be against <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> you know well just about everybody is against <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> use so let's test everybody for it
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		but the thing is it's not it's not my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>'s business what i do on the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekends</TIMEX> or in in the evenings you know if i show up for work hungover
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		then they've got something to say you know so hungover to the extent that i'm not able to do my job well
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah i know think most impairments would be obvious fairly obvious you know but
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah but on the other hand if i go out and have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fifteen thousand</NUMEX> beers but then i'm fine <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the next morning</TIMEX>
 		it's none of their business
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know what i do with myself or if if i smoke fifteen <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">joints</ENAMEX> or something and i hit or whatever um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and that's how i feel about it uh things drug testing for uh marijuana i guess can detect use uh or actually they can do tests with um with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hair samples</ENAMEX> of hair and finger nails
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		that can test or detect use <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">like months</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> previous
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		you know and so it's obviously that there's not you could've decided okay i'm going to stop now and may have stopped for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three months</TIMEX> and still it would show up in these tests and that's completely unfair
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um
 		also especially it's unfair when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> don't offer some sort of treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">program</ENAMEX> also it you know it's like oh we find you with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> so huh you're gone
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		get out of here
 		um luckily my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> is doesn't uh do any of that sort of thing they they were talking about doing the policy of testing new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> as they come in but not anything it it wouldn't be random it would be everybody um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and it wouldn't be current <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> it would only be new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> um
 		but i you know i
 	
 	
 		yeah  seems like it's a sneaky way to introduce it because eventually you know then everybody would
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		done it and they they
 	
 	
 		right yeah it it'll be
 	
 	
 		you know the climate would be different then
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and i i you know i don't think the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> have any
 		cause to do that sort of thing
 		unless there's you know reasonable suspicion you know if you come in
 		obvious glassy eyed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">everyday</TIMEX> from lunch or something it's okay somebody's been smoking some pot here
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		then do a drug test if you have some reasonable suspicion but it's
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know there there there's so many things i mean if if i were going through a divorce for instance which is something a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> experience that would really negatively affect my performance
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know are they going to require that i stay married or that i require me to some how have a perfect marriage or something well then you know that doesn't make sense
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh yeah</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so it's
 	
 	
 		yeah it just seems like it's a intrusion i mean the the only angle they might have is if um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i guess if they're paying the insurance premium or something like that then it you know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it might be that they the carrier the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carrier</ENAMEX> they're using has a
 		has higher rates or something like that so there's there's probably an economic argument
 	
 	
 		right well
 		in in in in that case charge the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> extra
