 		uh-huh do you
 	
 	
 		so what is your uh family what do you usually do as far as budgeting
 	
 	
 		we have a very detailed budget because my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> is a finance major
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and we have
 		you know we have money that we take out <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each month</TIMEX> that we um you know for food and and for
 		for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> and things like that and then we put aside so much money each month for birthdays and for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> and for um other things
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		then we take our major purchases we want to make during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that year</TIMEX> and we budget them into what we call our needs our needs and wants list
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and so um the things that like a vacation we have a vacation fund we have a fund for the things we need and then a for the things that we want
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and um and we're continually putting into those you know each month how much we're going to need and then we know <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the month</TIMEX> that we're going to have enough to get that particular item
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so we very rarely buy anything on credit everything we buy is paid for
 	
 	
 		yeah my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> is a finance major also  and uh we kind of have the same plan um we have one credit card um <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every month</TIMEX> we put um you know the same amount in for retirement
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">um</ENAMEX> and we budget we're our our new thing to our budget is we just had a baby so we're budgeting um each month um an allowance for his education starting now
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 	
 	
 		so that's in our budget <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every month</TIMEX> now that's the newest addition but we too do the same thing as far as um we have a set amount we take oh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> big <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">vacation a year</TIMEX> and then maybe you know <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> small vacations so we have
 		you know an exact amount that we spend on that each year
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and
 	
 	
 		um we have found that we spend less money if we pull out the money um instead of just writing checks for things
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		if we actually pull it out and keep it in a safe here
 	
 	
 		i see
 	
 	
 		and we actually pull out the money <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each month</TIMEX> that we want to put in for birthdays that we want to put in for um the vacation that we put in for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		like you have a separate account for that then
 	
 	
 		well a lot of that um i don't know how safe it is i guess um we keep it all in a safe here at the house
 	
 	
 		oh i see uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and so it's actually pulled out then we keep our we have a savings account for the kidzees education that money goes into there
 	
 	
 		oh i see
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		each of our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> we have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> so they each have their own account
 	
 	
 		i see
 	
 	
 		that money is put into each month
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh</ENAMEX> does your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> deal in um stocks and bonds and mutual funds and all that kind of stuff that does he invest in that and for long-term
 	
 	
 		he does somewhat
 		yeah he does somewhat
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um we have an investment plan yeah i guess he does
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but um we have really found this is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first year</TIMEX> we've done it this way and we are really saving a lot of money
 	
 	
 		really because you're you've you've sat down with a piece of paper and said well let's see what are we going to so what goes into that that particular thing it's vacations <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> birthdays uh car maintenance dental medical we just averaged out how much <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> we used per month on medical and how much we used on dental and um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and so now when we have to come up with that deductible that our insurance doesn't cover rather than wondering where it's going to come from
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		we have it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know and when when we see something on sale um instead of just looking in our checking account and saying well we've got enough and getting it and then when something comes up you know kind of scrimping to pay for a medical bill
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		everything's taken care of and we're finding that we even have more money than we thought
 	
 	
 		really well you know um what do you do as far as i i take it do you um run the family budget as far as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">uh groceries</ENAMEX> and that sort of thing
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i do uh-huh all the money
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh</ENAMEX> and how what's that
 	
 	
 		all the money is turned over to me
 	
 	
 		uh-huh do you have a set amount that that you spend <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each month</TIMEX> or or how do you work that
 	
 	
 		yes
 		i have a set amount it's very generous and i usually have extra and so then that can go um you know either back into our checking account or i can just carry it over
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um you know there are certain <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months of the year</TIMEX> that you'll spend more on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">other months</TIMEX> and certain times when that will be left over but that's completely up to me how i do that and then um because i don't work i stay home
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		i do too i stay home also
 	
 	
 		and so it's kind of my money and i also get my own money to do what i want to go to lunches you know and do that kind of thing
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		we have a clothing um envelope for each of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> and for myself and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> that we put how much we figure we need <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each month</TIMEX> on clothing
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it really works out great we're finding that we have a lot more money to spend on things like that and we're
 	
 	
 		yeah what what as far as like big things like something comes up and you have to buy a TV or um a big item like for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX> how do you have like a household
 	
 	
 		yes we have a household budget like we're going to need to buy a bed for my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> that's coming out of her crib <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> and also we need a new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bed</ENAMEX> and so we've got both of those budgeted and we put a certain amount in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each month</TIMEX> and we know which <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">month</TIMEX> we'll have enough saved to go buy those
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
