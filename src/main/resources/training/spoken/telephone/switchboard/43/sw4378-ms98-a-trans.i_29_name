 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i went with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> of mine and we undertook a building house
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and this was um a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lincoln</ENAMEX> log <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> where you have the wall partitions and it's preconstructed you might say
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and we started in um
 		we started from an empty <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lot</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">um trees</ENAMEX> and stuff on it and we had to cut them uh down and clear the lot we had to call in the escavators and have them dig the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">basement</ENAMEX> and pour the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">basement</ENAMEX> and um
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		went from the ground up our
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of our main problems was as well in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Massachusetts</ENAMEX> i thought i was gonna well it was a fun time but i thought gosh summer time you know well all it ever did was rain and thunderstorms and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 	
 	
 		one thing is that we're we had we were gonna pour the basement foundation
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and we're in the process and it started pouring down rain
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		and i guess we had most of it done but the end result what happened was that
 		some of the the water a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> settled on the top and it really didn't give a very good finish and some of the it was sort of sandy and and not um a very good finish
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but it turned it was okay and it's only the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">basement floor</ENAMEX> so it was okay
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but um it kept us pretty busy it was only um
 		there was well me and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> and then we just had like <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> helpers and uh sort of a
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		a family type it wasn't you know like a commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">project</ENAMEX> just something that sort of just
