 
     		
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		let's see how about um
 		let's see about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten years ago</TIMEX>
 		um
 		what do you think was different <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten years ago</TIMEX> from now
 	
 	
 		well i would say as far as social changes go um
 		i think <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> were more together they they did more things together uh they ate dinner at the table together um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		the the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> usually took out time um you know more time than they do now to come with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and and just spend the day doing a family activity
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um although i'm not a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> i i still think that um a lot has changed since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten years ago</TIMEX>
 		um what do you think about that
 	
 	
 		what do you well uh
 		actually <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten years</TIMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> seems rather short
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um
 		but i do agree that uh generally it's
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">society</ENAMEX> has sort of
 		uh
 		let's see rushed everything ahead
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		i don't know it leaves leaves a lot of time out for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> and things like that in other words they just prioritize their lives differently
 		but i think that has a lot to do with economic situations
 	
 	
 		yes what about like as far as um social changes in the individual
 		do you think that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> has as much time as they did let's say <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty years ago</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh
 		hm it depends uh
 		it's hard to say because i think
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> were busy <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten twenty years ago</TIMEX> too
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um
 		i just
 	
 	
 		well how how old are you
 	
 	
 		i'm <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty eight</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twenty eight</NUMEX> okay i'm <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty three</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so there's maybe a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five year</TIMEX> gap between us
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so um
 	
 	
 		i just i think that things were a bit were have been busy all along it's just a matter where priorities are at placed
 	
 	
 		huh
 		yes
 	
 	
 		and that um usually as far as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> are concerned there used to be just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> working and usually the other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> was home
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and now uh it's pretty much an economic necessity of for most in most places for both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> to work
 	
 	
 		do you think it's an economic crisis necessity or do you think that we're we're uh all trying to keep up with a certain standard of living
 	
 	
 		i think that's part of it too but i do think
 	
 	
 		i mean do you think <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> really need <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		
 
 		no no i don't
 	
 	
 		a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> in the suburbs or
 	
 	
 		no i don't think that but then there are a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that that don't have that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		that
 		that really do need to work
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i think maybe those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that really do need to work both parents
 		just to  survive and then there that is is that other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> that is working to maintain a standard of living that um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		okay
 	
 	
 		they think is is surviving  which is really more luxuries um but i i tend to think that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it's less those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that have the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> and everything than it is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> that is just trying to survive
 	
 	
 		you so you think it's
 		uh which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> are you saying is the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> trying
 	
 	
 		i'm saying that the uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> that is just trying to survive <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">from day</TIMEX> to day where both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> are working
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		is more of the majority than the than the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that have the higher standard of living
 		because if you look at economics across this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> and statistics on who has the money and who
 		the uh decreasing um
 		middle <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> in this country
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i think that that's in my opinion the case
 	
 	
 		
 
 		okay
 	
 	
 		so
 		i mean i have met <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that
 		uh both that
 		that just want to maintain a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the standard</TIMEX> of living and those that that really need the job
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">okay</ENAMEX> and then sometimes i i often uh find that
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		maybe there's so many different things available to us  a microwave a VCR a answering machine um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know a special a dishwasher um a refrigerator and some of those items um
 		for the for the um well i guess we're sticking more to social changes but um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> want all of that and not all of those are necessities
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		so they're trying to
 		it has become a necessity
