 
     		
 	
 		all right
 	
 	
 		okay well how about those Redskins huh
 	
 	
 		they're pretty good they um you know i can't they're not they're they're a good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh but uh i think uh i don't know how they'll do this year they'll probably still do pretty good have you uh been keeping up on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> they've been trading or anything
 	
 	
 		do you think
 		uh yeah they hadn't i don't think they really traded anybody that i know of yet um i've i've got <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> who collect football cards
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so they uh they compete pretty vigorously for all the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Redskins</ENAMEX> cards
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and uh actually we went to after they won the uh the uh <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Super Bowl</ENAMEX>
 		we actually went down to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mall</ENAMEX> in uh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> and saw uh you know all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX> down there and they had a big rally down there and so it was surprising how big those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> were i mean they they look big on the field but they're even bigger in person though
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
  
 		oh yeah they
 	
 	
 		especially that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe Jacobi</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		he's just a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX>'s a monster i mean he's not inhuman
 	
 	
 		
 
 		but most of them are what over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> foot aren't they
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		oh yeah they're all they're all huge <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> i mean a small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> would be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about six three</NUMEX> and
 	
 	
 		and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two hundred and some</NUMEX> pounds
 	
 	
 		yeah <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rypien Rypien</ENAMEX> you know for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">quarterback</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rypien</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> i think he was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six three or four and two thirty</TIMEX> which is really big
 	
 	
 		yeah he's
 		he's one of the taller <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">quarterbacks</ENAMEX> you know most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">quarterbacks</ENAMEX> are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only about six</NUMEX> foot
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but but uh he's one of the taller ones
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		well uh what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> are you predicting uh will come out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AFC</ENAMEX> next year
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		you know
 	
 	
 		that's a good question
 	
 	
 		you think <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Denver</ENAMEX> will be as tough as they were this year
 	
 	
 		well they might be i haven't really heard  who they been uh trading or anything but uh
 		they're usually pretty good right up near the top and so are the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Raiders</ENAMEX> so it's gonna be tough they always have a tough time with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Raiders</ENAMEX> so
 	
 	
 		yeah other than
 		yeah well i was real surprised uh that they did as well as they did <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> i didn't realize that they were as good as they were and actually i thought they probably should've beaten <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Buffalo</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		in the uh title game but
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i i think what one of their problems is is they they get overconfident in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the second half</TIMEX> they get ahead in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first half</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the second half</TIMEX> they just kind of blow it you know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and they've done that every <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every year</TIMEX> for a while
 	
 	
 		um-hum  you think <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mecklinburg</ENAMEX> is gonna hang around for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">another season</TIMEX> or is uh
 	
 	
 		oh he's getting up there in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</TIMEX> i don't know if he's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gonna</ENAMEX> stick around or not you know
 	
 	
 		yeah didn't they have a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> on there uh the wasn't a uh deaf <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">player</ENAMEX> on there this year
 	
 	
 		uh yeah yeah it's that uh
 		i can't think of his name now but he's on defensive
 	
 	
 		was it <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Davis Davis</ENAMEX> or something like that
 	
 	
 		yeah he's on defensive he's supposed to be pretty good though so
 	
 	
 		yeah i think he isn't he from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nebraska</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah i think so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		what kind of college <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> do you like
 	
 	
 		uh  i really don't even keep up with the college <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> that much you know
 	
 	
 		Cornhuskers right
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i'm just basically pro <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> you know basically
 	
 	
 		yeah i kind of run out of steam uh until right near the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the bowl</ENAMEX> games with all the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">colleges</ENAMEX> then i then i watch all the bowl games but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah does your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> let you watch uh plenty of football
 	
 	
 		uh
 		oh course uh now i get <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">nights</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">nights</TIMEX> are reserved for me
 	
 	
 		really
 		oh really that's pretty good yeah i usually uh i'm getting more and more into that habit but after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten years</TIMEX> i still haven't been able to get into the habit of of just having that time reserved but
 	
 	
 		yeah well
 	
 	
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year last year</TIMEX> was pretty good i got she cut me a lot of slack so i could actually watch some football
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well i kind of let her watch every <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">now</TIMEX> and then i'll let her watch her shows and then when her shows are over i'll turn it to the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last quarter</TIMEX> like on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">nights</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		what do you think of the instant replay rule
 	
 	
 		i think some of it's pretty good and some of it's not so good you know i kind of go either way on it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		what i can't believe is you know there are certain plays i guess that they don't use a instant replay on
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and you'll see you know the most flagrant you know foul or something else you know
 		and uh they just don't you know they don't do the instant replay and then on the other things you know a touchdown pass or something like that you know they always get out the instant replay and call backs
 	
 	
 		oh yeah that's kind of
 		yeah that's just like a couple of them instant replays they did they were over their <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two minute</TIMEX> limit and stuff <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this last year</TIMEX> and i think that's what's gonna hurt them from having it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		but i don't know <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> is coming up pretty good they did pretty good last year
 	
 	
 		which
 		yep
 		well yeah they really uh they really mauled the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Skins</ENAMEX>
