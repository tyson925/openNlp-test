 		i had a a tune up done and i had the i had the brakes done on it
 		and the the reason i did that was because i don't have a scope
 		and it has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> spark plugs
 		and it's hard to to get get at them and plus
 		the time  i just don't have time anymore um
 		as far as maintenance tasks that i do myself
 		i i usually change the oil and wash the air filter and i i had an occasion to change the had to change the the battery once
 		but
 		the brakes i was really surprised with the brakes  i wanted
 		i do have the background i know what needs to be done and i know the the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> needs to should be changed regularly very regularly and all of the bearings and and and the lubrication lubrication system needs to keep be lubricated and
 		so i i stay on top of that  but i  i wanted my front wheels i wanted the bearings packed
 		and they wanted something like fifteen dollars uh up front or something like that or maybe it was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> dollars to do it
 	
 	
 		just to pack the bearings
 	
 	
 		just to pack the bearings but what i found is that they had a brake job and they changed i had them another thing i i let them do sometimes is that
 		i let them go through and let them tell me what let them do the diagnostics that's free okay and then i can decide whether i want them to do it or whether i can do it see
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and they told me that my my brake pads were gosh you know seventy percent still good you know
 		but still it was cheaper in the long run and uh so i just got the the the brakes done and i thought that was a good deal and and plus
 	
 	
 		right and they repacked the wheel bearings
 	
 	
 		and they we repacked the the wheel bearings yeah but
 		i've i've had considerable experience i you might say i'm a mechanic
 		a good back yard mechanic and i you know i took auto <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX> in high school it's been a while back but i i still have a pretty good feel for it
 		but <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> thing i didn't know is that
 		when i was messing around with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> and stuff and most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> i had i had bigger cars
 		and the brakes go out fairly rapidly on those but what i was surprised at is that on my little <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nissan</ENAMEX>
 		i bought the truck with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about sixty thousand</NUMEX> i have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost a hundred and ten</NUMEX>
 		so i drove on those brake pads
 		for uh you know forty <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">five thousand miles</NUMEX> and there was hardly any wear to them so those small little <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trucks</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> like that they they just the longevity of the brake pads is really good
 	
 	
 		you know they've gotten to the point that where they don't weigh very much and the the surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">material</ENAMEX> on the pads is so good
 	
 	
 		exactly
 		exactly so i you know but i i just did it anyway i like to stay i like to stay up on it you know like to stay kind of stay up on it then
 		if you go in like just about any point any you know point in time
 		and pull my dip stick
 		and pull it out and look at the oil the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> is you might say a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a light</NUMEX> golden brown you know it's not dirty i i i keep it that way because that's
 		that is the key to the longevity so
 	
 	
 		right
 		well
 	
 	
 		so so how
 	
 	
 		it it sounds like you've had um
 		some good experiences with that uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and my experiences have been kind of contrary to that
 	
 	
 		uh oh
 	
 	
 		um i
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i get a little more involved in the maintenance of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> and uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and in fact i have an <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eighty seven</NUMEX> mustang with a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">302</NUMEX> in it that i've uh beefed up a little bit
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		okay
 	
 	
 		and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the things that i did was to change the pulley system on it to use under drive pulleys so that the engine doesn't have to turn the accessories and can
 		use more of the power to the rear wheels um the only catch was the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> set of under drive pulleys that i put on it were
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um not even cast <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aluminum</ENAMEX> they were just pressed aluminum
 	
 	
 		you're talking about the vibration dampener
 	
 	
 		well there's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> there's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> pulleys that you change you change the crank pulley and the alternator pulley
 	
 	
 		that's the vibration dampener yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh the water pump pulley
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		so
 		when i changed those over i put on these these pressed aluminum things
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		probably <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about four months ago</TIMEX> the water pump decided to go out
 	
 	
 		uh oh
 	
 	
 		so in the process of seizing the belt spun on the pulley and wore through the water pump pulley almost all the way
 	
 	
 		hm
 		uh oh
 	
 	
 		but not far enough to notice
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		so i was on my way to work <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX> and uh the water pump pulley split laterally in half
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		so there was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a half</NUMEX> a water pump <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pulley</ENAMEX> still attached to the water pump and the other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> was kind of dangling off the end of the crank and uh so i
