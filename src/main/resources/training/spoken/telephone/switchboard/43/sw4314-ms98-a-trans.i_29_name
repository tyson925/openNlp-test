 		yeah okay
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> is south
 	
 	
 		oh okay all right well that sounds pretty good does uh i guess the weather does that stay pretty constant there or
 	
 	
 		it's it's gets <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cold</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> and then warm in the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoons</TIMEX> probably seventies eighties in the afternoon
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		okay well that's pretty temperate yeah that's not too bad but uh  yeah have you done uh any other boating then or
 	
 	
 		no i hadn't done any in a lately uh lately but that's all i used to have uh have a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> that owned his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daddy</ENAMEX> owned a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX> and we used to when i was in high school we used to go out
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		go boating everyday just about
 	
 	
 		oh that's great yeah i
 	
 	
 		and we had a new different boat everyday
 	
 	
 		oh that's fantastic yeah i used to uh kind of be that way myself when i lived in in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">northwestern Florida</ENAMEX> in the panhandle i used to sail about everyday i'd work go to work
 	
 	
 		i'd like to do some sailing
 	
 	
 		yeah it's a lot of fun it's uh especially if you get a a pretty fast <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> like those catamarans are pretty fast you can actually
 	
 	
 		yeah what do you if you get one like that they have somebody teach you there or they just
 	
 	
 		well actually i i've known how to sail pretty much my whole life um my my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>'s pretty into it and uh i took sailing lessons when i was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about six</NUMEX> and then uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		is it pretty easy
 	
 	
 		yeah it's it's kind of a thing where you get the hang of it after a while you know um just kind of get a feel for the wind and how it works and and the physics behind it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so it's it's not too bad it's pretty easy to get the hang of i think and uh generally everybody i've i've known has kind of gotten into it but some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are more motorboaters you know which is fun
 	
 	
 		yeah that well that's about all we have
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> don't don't see the excitement in sailing but then again they may ne'er may they may never have tried anything like uh catamaran
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh that's when you really start getting into speed you know you can actually some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">catamarans</ENAMEX> can actually pull <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">skiers</ENAMEX> they get so fast you know
 	
 	
 		i didn't know that
 	
 	
 		yeah they get pretty quick but uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that that'd be something
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i haven't i haven't personally done that but um the races i i work with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> right now that uh  races catamarans in the summertime
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh he's pretty gassed about it he's got a good uh
 	
 	
 		what kind of what lake do y'all use
 	
 	
 		well he uh he's from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Detroit</ENAMEX> so he usually goes on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Great Lakes</ENAMEX> i think and does his sailing um for me i i go back to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Orlando</ENAMEX> uh in about a month
