 
     		
 	
 		all right i guess well we're recording now
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh well the last thing i had done was a a muffler  put on my truck
 		and then i usually do my own oil changes
 	
 	
 		yeah my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> needs uh
 		an uh
 		i think a muffler but um
 		not sure because i haven't looked at it yet it's just getting louder
 	
 	
 		hm yeah
 	
 	
 		to live in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New England</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		where do you live
 	
 	
 		i live in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fort Worth Texas</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh and uh
 		i guess uh so do you do your own <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> repairs or do you take it to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garage</ENAMEX> to have it done
 	
 	
 		i mostly do my own
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i i find it uh more satisfactory
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and i like to save the money too
 	
 	
 		oh yeah that's true i try to do most of my own to  but nowadays a lot of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> are getting to be especially on engines getting to be computerized and stuff so
 	
 	
 		yeah makes a lot harder
 	
 	
 		yep
 	
 	
 		i've got uh some hesitation problem
 		that uh
 		i haven't figured figured out it's got <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fuel</ENAMEX> injection and it's all computerized so
 	
 	
 		well yeah
 	
 	
 		i don't know
 	
 	
 		uh i think sometimes that could be the computer going bad on you
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and the only way to fix that is by taking it
 		and having them analyze the computer
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		because we had the same problem  on our car
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		and uh they took it in and they found a problem with the computer itself
 		because it quit on my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> one time coming home from
 		from a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> house it just quit on her died on her
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		but other than that i usually like i said i try i do all the spark plugs changes wires and i do my own tune-ups and stuff
 		uh
 		other than the major stuff i usually take it to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> you know repair <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX> because i don't have much time to do much anything else
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that's one thing finding the time to do it
 	
 	
 		that's for sure
 		uh
 		what
 	
 	
 		it did you do your muffler
 	
 	
 		no i take it down to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Midas</ENAMEX> and have them do it
 		that way it's guaranteed if anything goes wrong with it they got to replace it
 	
 	
 		yeah that's that's not a fun job either
 	
 	
 		
 
 		no
 		it was uh pretty simple really they they did it in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about a half hour</TIMEX> you know and
 		it would've cost me just as much for the whole thing because it came with a an assembly
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		uh it
 		it uh unbolted just in front of the muffler and it went to the tail pipe and it was just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all one</NUMEX> piece
 		and it would've cost me just as much to
 		from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealer</ENAMEX> just to get the
 		the part than it would be to have it done down there so i just went ahead and had them do it
 	
 	
 		hm
 		what um what kind of vehicle
 	
 	
 		at the i got a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> pickup
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and the like i said the price of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> would've been more just about as much as
 		having <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Midas</ENAMEX> do it so
 		
 
 		it was just easy just to have them go ahead and do it real quick
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yes a a lot of times the the bolts are all rusty and
 		makes it hard to get it apart anyway but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last time</TIMEX> i looked underneath it all i mean just rusted to pieces
 	
 	
 		well yeah  if you let go far enough it'll fall off
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		uh oh
 		but i usually like i said i usually do a lot of my own work and uh
 		the only we've only only had one like i said had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> major problem with our car
 		and i let them handle it at the car <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealer</ENAMEX> since it was still under warranty
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh
 		do you do all your own tune-ups and stuff
 	
 	
 		yeah uh
 		spark plugs
 		the coolant changing the oil
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		uh
 		i
 		see
 		i had to do quite a few things when i when i bought this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> used
 		uh
 		the alternator was loose uh
 		had to fix that
 		and they had the uh
