 
     		
 	
 		uh well i'm not sure how it is in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Georgia</ENAMEX> but in in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX> the rate the crime rate really is not very high at the moment is that is that true for for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX> is kind of high uh
 		it's it's lower than it has been in the past uh i guess nineteen <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ninety</NUMEX> is when it start to drop off and usually around the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas season</TIMEX> is usually when the crime rate is a little bit higher
 	
 	
 		yeah i that's that's probably not true only for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Atlanta</ENAMEX> but for just about anywhere
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh what kind of crime problem do you usually run into any pacifits
 	
 	
 		well uh from least what from what's on the news uh there are very few like actual robberies reported uh uh of of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residences</ENAMEX> what's more likely to occur is uh
 		robbery of uh you know knocking over a a small store
 		or a car theft you know it things of that nature very few uh you you assaults although on the college campuses uh there are uh
 		cases of you know like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> getting machine from a from an automated teller and you know somebody trying to to device a scam for for uh getting the money for them that actually preys mostly on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreigners</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		but mostly petty things and nothing nothing nothing nothing really too big
 	
 	
 		right well i guess here we run into that sometime but i guess a lot of crimes are done with uh apartment type break-ins you know
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		that type not much home break-ins there are some but not not very high
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> as far as tellers and things like that it's not extremely high either there there were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> case where uh this one <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> uh was
 		taking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> from the teller and and you know making them give him money and stuff and then at the same time raping them also so it's kind of like a double assault there
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah uh a strange case that uh that happened lets about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about a year ago</TIMEX> was someone actually stole a complete automated teller machine
 	
 	
 		
 
 		really
 	
 	
 		it was a freestanding machine and they backed up into it with a truck and put it on the back and drove away with it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		now there's a crime for you
 	
 	
 		there is a crime
 	
 	
 		yeah but uh i guess most of the things that happen around here are are pretty uh innocuous although uh from what i hear in the news and and
 		i i saw saw an episode of the TV show Cops
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time that was in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX> and uh
 		it it it did surprise me because you know they were doing drug arrests and thing and things like that
 		but i i don't really think those things happen happen too often because like like i said from what's reported in the news at least it's it's not all that common
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 		hm i don't know crime situations here they like i say a lot of a lot of cases is usually just <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartments</ENAMEX> and and break-ins and things like that and a lot of it is due to drugs
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		or drug related you know in in most cases it's not like uh
 		if someone do steal a a television or VCR or something like that it is for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> you know because you really can't on the street make any money off of it per se you know you gonna only get <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> or fifteen bucks for it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so you really not making a sizeable profit so it's not really lucrative to take chances like that you know even though it it does exist
 	
 	
 		you know i i just to diverge a little bit uh i live in an <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> right now i'm finishing out my <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last semester</TIMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Pittsburgh</ENAMEX> and uh
 		the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> like would be very easy for just about anyone to break in but even so it i mean it's it's still difficult for me to convince my apartment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mates</ENAMEX> to to like lock the doors when they go out  you know and things like that
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh it it would be so easy for someone who is motivated to do so to just you know sit out back take a look at when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are here when they're not just come in
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know there's a TV and a VCR and they could uh they could get in pretty easy and especially uh since there are <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedrooms upstairs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> leave the door open you know while they're upstairs playing music it it could still happen then
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah that's true but you be surprised also how  much <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> watch you that even uh
 		uh participating in any type crime i guess there was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> case i was surprised uh so happen this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> worked at the same place i work for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Georgia Tech</ENAMEX>
 		and they work at the same place i did but i didn't know that they had been watching me because i was getting ready to go in my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one morning</TIMEX> and the first thing they said is
 		uh you must don't have to be to work at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">eight</TIMEX> you know like shock
