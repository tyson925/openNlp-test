 
     		
 	
 		well actually uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i i don't think i'm in the uh
 		uh majority of in in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> i don't think i agree with no uh i wouldn't say that i think i would have said that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few years ago</TIMEX> when i was younger i thought it was a
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		you don't believe in it
 	
 	
 		a sign of a civilized society if you didn't have uh capital punishment but
 		um uh maybe slowly changing my opinion
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i'm not
 		thoroughly opposed to it i still think it's
 		sort of true that a
 		a more civilized society wouldn't have to use capital punishment but i'm beginning to believe this is less civilized society than i thought
 	
 	
 		you sound a lot like a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> of mine a a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> i hang out with she has very
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		very black and white opinions you know there's no gray in her opinions you know she she probably would agree more with you but but i don't know i think
 		i would rather a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> go ahead and be put down than give them the  opportunity to
 		get out and do it again i've never had a a punishment or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a</NUMEX> a crime like a murder touch my immediate family but i still feel very strongly that capital punishment is a good way to to
 		punish especially <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">criminals</ENAMEX> who seem to have absolutely no remorse for what they've done and we see that more and more like in our <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> right now there's a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fourteen year old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> who
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		raped and then killed a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven year</TIMEX> old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> you know that's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fourteen years old</TIMEX> what's he going to be doing when he turns into an adult
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 		i certainly don't uh advocate turning <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> like that loose
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i'm not sure executing them uh
 		does anymore than keeping them in jail but uh
 	
 	
 		no it doesn't but it costs less
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah that's a factor
 	
 	
 		and yeah to me it is i mean i work and i pay my taxes and i lived out in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> for a little while and they're
 		it that's a pretty heavy state compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Georgia</ENAMEX> i mean you <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> are are a lot more uh for to each his own even than we are in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Georgia</ENAMEX> but even in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Georgia</ENAMEX>
 		that's the attitude for the most part if i work and pay my dues you work and pay your dues and we'd get along just fine
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but when i've got to work to pay my dues and your dues
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		then i don't like you very much anymore
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well i the cost is something but it's i think it's relatively unimportant compared to
 		what's the most effective way of
 		dealing with crime and i guess uh
 		i would like i don't know the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> certainly uh none of them have capital punishment and they don't have a they don't have a crime problem either no you can't they don't execute anybody in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> and i don't believe they do in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX> either  and they don't have the crime problems we do i don't really think that there is too much of a relationship between the two
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i guess what worries me about capital punishment is uh
 		when i see <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> enthusiastic about it and uh
 		uh
 		sort of bloodthirsty i think it brings out the worst in the in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who do the punishing and the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that</TIMEX> that bothers me but it but uh
 	
 	
 		you might be right
 		i mean i i'd hate to be the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> to pull the switch you know i would never in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a million years</TIMEX> want that job but i do believe it's necessary and i on the one hand i i guess i admire the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> who has the
 	
 	
 		
 
 		hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		guts to do it because i couldn't i couldn't stand behind a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">gun</ENAMEX> and shoot somebody for nothing and i couldn't pull the switch but i
 	
 	
 		huh
 		well actually i what the other thing that bothers me is when it becomes a political issue because i don't really think it uh
 		i don't really think it's a subject um
 		very important aspect of fighting crime or law and order or anything else i think it just becomes a uh  symbolic i'm tougher than you are type of emotional issue for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i would like for it to be settled once for all and uh get in the background while the more important issues get discussed uh uh like i said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">some years ago</TIMEX> i think i would have said there's no place for capital punishment in the
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		civilized western <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> now i'm i'm not so sure of that i'm i i wouldn't vote against somebody just because it was for capital punishment and nor the other way around
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		what
 		what's making you become more convinced that it might be a
 	
 	
 		uh i guess i'm i'm my view of
 	
 	
 		good way of punishing
 	
 	
 		uh
 		my i'm beginning to believe that some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are simply not rehabilitatable and
 		that uh
 		uh
 		costs and other factors justify uh um executing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> maybe it's more a symbolic gesture that um um than anything else and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i've also never been a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victim</ENAMEX> although i have some
 		i have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wives</ENAMEX> were murdered and uh
 	
 	
 		oh gosh  yes if it ever touched my family
 	
 	
 		i can imagine that uh
 		uh for some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> it would be the only form of justice in that case
