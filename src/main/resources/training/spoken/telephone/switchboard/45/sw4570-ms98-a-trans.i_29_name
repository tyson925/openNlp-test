 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh do you have a couple of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i have one she's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty months</TIMEX> old
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh boy
 	
 	
 		how many do you have  how many do you have
 	
 	
 		at least you're sleeping
 		i have uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> one's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eleven</NUMEX> and one's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fourteen</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		i imagine the activities we uh encounter with our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> are quite different at this point
 	
 	
 		they probably are  but maybe you can give me some insight and i can remind you of the  old times huh
 	
 	
 		oh i remember them fondly it seems like the the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> like young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> uh destroy your sleep and older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> destroy your life
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i don't really mean that it
 	
 	
 		well i've heard that it only gets worse my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> and i sit around thinking gosh you know what are we going to do when she starts going out and
 		having <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> and going to school and getting exposed to all the other things out there
 	
 	
 		oh
 		i think the biggest problem is that you just have no training for this
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and you really have to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX> it you know as you go
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but i i remember fondly having the small ones they they seemed real happy and it was so easy to solve their problems and as they get older it just seems that everything is more serious and and
 	
 	
 		complicated
 	
 	
 		it's more complicated it's emotional it's not a matter of giving them a lollipop anymore it it just gets harder
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yes
 	
 	
 		but um what we've done and you might want to do as you know as time flies by is i'm remarried and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> never had any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so we were trying to figure out how um how we would make this turnover as smooth as possible and we came up with what we call the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> meeting
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and once a week we get together and this is a chance when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> can say whatever they want without us getting insulted about it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and we have sort of an agenda that's like good news <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</TIMEX> bad news <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</TIMEX> uh suggestions any new business any uh
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		any questions questions any anything you know and we
 	
 	
 		how long does that last how long does your meeting last
 	
 	
 		well it it changes it could be a quiet week it could be the kind of thing where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> want to go do something else so it goes pretty quick at the end is allowance so they have to make it through you know collect
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that sounds like a good theory or a good way to do it
 	
 	
 		well you know we we actually sit and talk to each other once a week at least you know not that we don't all the time
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but it it it works out nicely and i don't know you know i think i'd do that even if i wasn't remarried if i had thought about it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and you know we plan also plan a family activity because <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are coming and going and it's hard to be all together to do something so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh what kind of things do you do on the family activities
 	
 	
 		well it could be a game of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Scrabble</ENAMEX> and or it could be you know reading a book out loud or making up a story and passing it around the table you know one sentence to each person
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and um it's it's not something that's impossible i mean the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> will usually want to go to a game <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> or something you know we can't do that you know we try to keep it real
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right
 		it's getting quite expensive to do that these days
 	
 	
 		oh please
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah that another thing that comes up with us is family vacation
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		we just kind of knock our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heads</ENAMEX> we don't know how to make that right it seems as if we do what they want
 		uh we marathoned a trip in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> we stayed with some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> for awhile and then we went to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sea World</ENAMEX> and we went to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Disneyland</ENAMEX> and we we went to every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX> thing
 	
 	
 		did you drive there
 	
 	
 		uh no we we flew to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> and we stayed free at my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aunt</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> so that gave us a base in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		and we saw <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sea World</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">zoo</ENAMEX> and this and that and our lives were sort of normal because we you know it was someone else's <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> so we made sure we had dinner at dinnertime and that kind of thing
 		then we drove a bit further and when we were on our own it just kind of fell apart because we'd stay late at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX> and
 		i didn't enjoy it after awhile you know once is you know it's interesting but it's really not my cup of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> and family vacations are kind of difficult
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know sharing a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> is not much of a vacation once they're old enough to know the difference
 	
 	
 		true true
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		yeah my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> wants to go on a family vacation we're on the east coast like you and he wants to go out to uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grand Canyon</ENAMEX> and do that sort of thing when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helen</ENAMEX> gets a little older but
 		it's hard to tell i at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty months old</TIMEX> he's he wants take her to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">zoo</ENAMEX> and that sort of thing but i'm not sure if she's ready for any of that if she's you know if it could hold her interest
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		so we don't really have anything any kind of family activities to do we basically just sit around the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and
 		she runs from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to the other and we read to her that's something she enjoys
 	
 	
 		well i guess the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">playgrounds</ENAMEX> used to be hot when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> were little
 	
 	
 		yeah there's not many of them out there though like was when i was young
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		i mean there was a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">playground</ENAMEX> just about in every neighborhood but i don't even know where one is around here anymore
 	
 	
 		there might be some at the schools
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know that you can use when it's an off time you know on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a weekend</TIMEX> or something
 	
 	
 		yeah that's a good idea
 	
 	
 		and a lot of if you have a a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YMCA</ENAMEX> or something they have kind of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tot</ENAMEX> programs where they have little exercise class for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> her age and all kinds of things
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 		hm
 	
 	
 		what help yeah go ahead
 	
 	
 		probably
 		probably be very hard to be the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">instructor</ENAMEX>  <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty months</TIMEX> old
 	
 	
 		huh yeah but that's not your problem that's the fun of it you
