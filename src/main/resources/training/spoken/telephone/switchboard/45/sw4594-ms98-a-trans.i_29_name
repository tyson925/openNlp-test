 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah go ahead
 	
 	
 		okay well um
 		i've never i've didn't really ever have to have a budget um until i quit going to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Georgia Tech</ENAMEX> and um then i learned to budget really fast  um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i had been working part-time before that and uh my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> were helping me some but um
 		i got to where i mean i knew where every <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">penny</NUMEX> was going but then as i started making more money um
 		my budget's kind of hasn't doesn't exist except for at certain times  you know
 	
 	
 		right and you make more money but it goes away anyway
 	
 	
 		right well i don't have to worry i mean i don't have to think ahead as much like you know but i haven't really saved anything i'm still trying to uh i've i have school debts i'm still paying back and stuff
 	
 	
 		yeah i have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> so uh it's a serious it's a serious matter but uh my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>'s just starting to go back to work maybe that'll take the
 	
 	
 		oh okay so you have to budget
 	
 	
 		pressure off but i must  i must confess the only control i have over our budget is to try and make as many things as constant as possible like
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		tuition and try to make things <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</TIMEX> so that there are as few surprises as possible but i don't i've started keeping a budget on computer
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i guess <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each of the last five years</TIMEX> and never followed through and about this time of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> is when i get religion i have to do my income taxes i realize that better recording keeping would've helped and uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i still haven't managed to uh uh do it the way i should
 	
 	
 		yeah but even even if you do break your budget i think when you write things down or however if if you do it on the computer whatever or something where you can just constantly see exactly what where your money's going
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		then you it's it's easier even if you don't stick to it i think it you know it's better to have you a little bit more conservative hm
 	
 	
 		right i believe if i had to that i could  estimate
 		all the major form all the major sources of spending uh on a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</TIMEX> basis and come pretty close but i'm sure that there are a bunch of surprises in there that uh
 		i would find and maybe learn how to control if i uh kept a formal budget or uh financial plan
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but
 	
 	
 		but even if you can't i don't think have enough a really when before when i had a strict budget it's because i had too i knew exactly where every <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">penny</NUMEX> was going before i had it but
 		it's it's a little bit harder when you have a little bit more leeway
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but also it i think it's bad to have like you know say you have these debts and you you know you're paying a lot of interest on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> and you wanna go ahead and get it you know paid off sometimes
 		i've looked at it that way and really just you know pinched myself in other places so that i could do that you know uh pay it off and
 	
 	
 		yeah the only problem is that if you have if you have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>  what you're gonna need for them <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few years from now</TIMEX> is what you need to be putting aside now and that's uh you can fool yourself if you don't set that up somehow
 	
 	
 		right
 		and that's hard to see but if you if you try to be too strict on yourself then your then you just end up getting really frustrated don't ever you know just
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		just blow a little bit that's you know
 	
 	
 		right
 		but you'll find that the  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> don't really have a very good sense of where the money is going and so they'll ask for things pretty much constantly
 	
 	
 		right i remember doing that as a child
 	
 	
 		and i've i learned to say no pretty much constantly  and uh uh so i would be better if i had a budget and i had a certain amount of uh fun money that had to be spent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each month</TIMEX> or that was allowed to be spent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each month</TIMEX> i'd feel better about it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so who knows maybe this'll get me to do it   you don't have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		no i sure don't
 	
 	
 		well that's a big change in life in a lot of ways but budgeting is one of them
 	
 	
 		oh i know i mean i've i've had i have a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> and that's you know  that's
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well that's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> solution
 	
 	
 		that's hard enough i mean i know but i mean you know that's a lot  some sort of you know when some there's times when i
 		if i couldn't afford to buy myself groceries i would buy them for her first
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know just because you i mean you feel a lot worse because this being is completely dependent on you you know
 	
 	
 		that's an interesting spirit but and i suppose <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> are like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> they don't take no for an answer  as easily
 	
 	
 		well then  uh yeah they are a lot simpler but  but i'm i'm just saying you know i
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it it would it would be hard to know that someone else's life was completely dependent on you you know
 	
 	
 		yeah the hard part though is not uh it the hard part is um um setting aside for what they're gonna need in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five or ten years</TIMEX>  that's uh really difficult
 	
 	
 		right
 		it's hard to see that right now even though you know you have too
 	
 	
 		yep
 		right
 		well i've made my confession
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm
 	
 	
 		and
 	
 	
 		i'm glad we had this conversation because it makes me think i need to sit down and  maybe write
