 
     		
 	
 		okay i'll let you start do you all keep a budget and how do you hold to yours
 	
 	
 		
 
 		no i i never keep a budget my budget or philosophy i guess is is spend as little as possible
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		well that's that's good  especially for these times
 	
 	
 		and uh and it's it's sort sort of always worked
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh but that depends on you know on the individual if they can
 		i guess have self control
 	
 	
 		well that's a lot of it uh i know we tried several different ways <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time we tried something that really worked but we didn't keep it up i passed it on to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> and she won't quit doing it she loves it and that was the envelope system
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		where you go ahead and decide about how much based on what you did <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last month</TIMEX> that you are going to spend and you put the cash in envelopes marked for that so you have one for entertainment and one for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">groceries</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et</ENAMEX> cetera and then for some reason
 		taking it out of that envelope and seeing it in cash instead of in check form
 		uh causes you to realize how much is left and she even writes down on the envelope as she subtracts and kind of debits on each envelope what she's buying and then at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the end of the</TIMEX> of the period pay period
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		if she has any left that much is for fun or entertainment and they kind of work it that way we tried for a while and it seems like the problem that we were having of all the of all the things that worked was not planning enough for the incidentals that we couldn't think about
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yes
 	
 	
 		and those are the ones that will kill you you know the accident the accidental fee or the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> repair or the things that weren't supposed to be every month
 	
 	
 		well yeah i i couldn't probably be bothered doing doing that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh</ENAMEX>  that's what i mean it was a hassle
 	
 	
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every month</TIMEX> and and every since uh well we've been married almost <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty years</TIMEX> now but um my my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> got paid once a month
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so  you learn to get through  you learn to get through you know to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the month</TIMEX> and uh
 	
 	
 		that's that's kind of hard
 		
 
 		but do you sort of self budget even though i mean you wouldn't like on payday think <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> i can go do this and that and this and that you kind of think this is got to straight you kind of divide it in fourths in a way don't you
 	
 	
 		no no because if you charge things and uh you pay all your bills at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the beginning of the month</TIMEX> when you get paid or you get paid <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last day</TIMEX> or next to the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last day</TIMEX> you pay all your bills then there isn't anything left to spend anyway
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 		well that's true what we're in the process of doing right now is paying off our credit cards entirely
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and we're going to go ahead and try to just live on what we earn instead of guessing ahead of what we probably will have <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next month</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		well yeah we we tried to to
 	
 	
 		and
 	
 	
 		to or we are paying them off now or there was a time when maybe we didn't pay all of them off but you just sort of had to watch what you put in because you you hate to pay those finance charges when you see how much it is
 	
 	
 		yeah we're not there yet
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		that's right that's right
 	
 	
 		and for most of uh i mean i'm a substitute <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> and i've only substituted i guess for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last fifteen years</TIMEX> so there's only been really one working  and uh
 	
 	
 		um
 		um-hum same here yeah
 	
 	
 		it it works for me but i can't see that it it would work for probably the majority of people
 	
 	
 		well i could say it's kind of you know that's that's good you may you probably have a little extra than you have to have
 		to you know what i'm saying and so that that's the difference there where sometimes like i know if we've had an especially <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">bad month</TIMEX> and we're just almost getting down to payday
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		then i think if we could really budget we tried <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time i know when we were planning to buy the new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> and we hadn't had a car payment in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five years</TIMEX>
 		we had to go ahead and write down <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each month</TIMEX> what it was that every <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">penny</NUMEX> went for to see how much was gonna be left and that was a real eye opener
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah
 		um-hum it it is when you do it that way
 	
 	
 		uh-huh but to to have lived by that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every week</TIMEX> would have been tough for me because sometimes i'll spend less on groceries but we'll go out
 		so it's kind of hard to say this is how much you're gonna spend going out for fun this is how much you're gonna spend it's kind of hard do you
 	
 	
 		well we we eat out a a good deal at this point i i started subbing just to go on a vacation and saved all that money so because i knew that you couldn't you know spending <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">five thousand dollars</NUMEX> on a vacation or whatever we were gonna go for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten weeks</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		right  right
 		oh how nice
 	
 	
 		ah in nineteen eighty so i started working in nineteen <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eighty seven</NUMEX> and just saved for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three years</TIMEX> but the what minuscule amount i made but that way you just didn't put it on your credit card and and it was paid for
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		with
 		well that's good and it made a big and you enjoyed it better probably yeah
 	
 	
 		yes and so i think that that's difficult for most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> but then my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> was very <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scotch</ENAMEX> and you know you never could afford anything although he could afford everything if he wanted to um
 	
 	
 		i think so too
 		so if you're out like in a department store and there's a sale you're just real careful not to let your urges get hold of you that that's excellent that's what i'm working toward i think you're probably much ahead of me there and i'm working on it
 	
 	
 		yes
 		and i never worried about saving money because we just we're in the savings plan at work and they took it out so
 	
 	
 		same here same here and i think though that we need to have some liquid around that you don't have to go through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> to get  you know yeah
 	
 	
 		i uh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		well we never had too much of that but then we never had any really emergencies that uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that came up yeah
 	
 	
 		and we didn't buy really new or expensive <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> i think the most my we're looking at <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> now uh we ever spent for a new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> was like <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">six thousand dollars</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and they were mainly used <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		well that's the best thing to do my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the other day</TIMEX> it was the worst mistake we ever did to buy a new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> because it wasn't worth it from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> after so
 	
 	
 		yeah so you know we've been rather rather frugal in that
 	
 	
 		rather frugal well that that's gonna payoff on retirement yeah well it uh i guess we've completed do you think we've been here <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		in that respect yeah
 		well each each time they used to call in and tell me their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">space</ENAMEX> is limited and to please uh
