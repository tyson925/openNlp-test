 
     		
 	
 		uh what kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> would you uh buy next
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well that's a good question we just got in from looking at <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> and we've probably been looking at them for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple months</TIMEX> and we haven't bought one yet  so that almost answers the question how about you
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh you have okay
 		oh and you haven't
 		um we just bought one um we bought one <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about a month ago</TIMEX> it was a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ninety one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Thunderbird</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		um we really liked it because um we just moved here from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Dakota</ENAMEX> and we have we do some quite a bit of traveling
 		and that was a nice <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> to travel in but we have also a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ford</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">Probe</ENAMEX> and that's better to get around <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> in because the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Thunderbird</ENAMEX> takes a lot of gas
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but um the reason we're stuck on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fords</ENAMEX> i guess is because i used to sell <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fords</ENAMEX> and so we're kind of stuck on that kind of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> but
 		i really like um that kind of car myself but
 	
 	
 		well we we've been looking at  just about everything i guess because we really don't need a car we just sort of  want the luxury of buying a new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> and um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i don't know we were <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> we were looking at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lexuses</ENAMEX> and we keep going back to Cadillacs
 	
 	
 		oh do you
 	
 	
 		and looking at those and then you don't know if you wanna spend <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">thousand dollars</NUMEX> and buy a new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> or whether you wanna buy uh like a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ninety one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cadillac</ENAMEX> a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ninety or ninety one</NUMEX> for you know <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty</TIMEX> or nineteen or fifteen you can get them
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		fairly cheap compared to buying a brand new one  and the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lexus</ENAMEX> that that they have that you you pay sticker price for those
 	
 	
 		a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lexus</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh</ENAMEX> and isn't that neat though that is a neat <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> don't you think
 	
 	
 		yes yes we we were  we were all in them <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> but you know when it comes to oops
 	
 	
 		
 
 		were you
 	
 	
 		you know do you wanna spend <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about thirty thousand dollars</NUMEX> and uh it'd probably be a little over that with the tax  so that's that's really where
 	
 	
 		right
 		oh i know
 	
 	
 		where we are or should we just buy you know a little <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Volkswagen</ENAMEX> we've right we've you know the one of those Cabriolets i guess they're called uh it's a convertible it's sort of like you know <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> in the back
 	
 	
 		yeah and get around town
 		uh-huh yeah i like those
 	
 	
 		but the the selling point i guess that that i or it has to pass my test i'm i'm short and i need to sit in the seat see if i can get the seat high enough to see over the steering wheel like i like to see
 	
 	
 		are you shorter
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm  <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about five two</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		are you oh then that's yeah
 	
 	
 		and to make sure the seat belt doesn't hit me in the neck that it comes really over the shoulder and not up around your neck so
 	
 	
 		yeah it's got to be a comfortable car
 	
 	
 		right well it can be comfortable but those things not all the seat belts are gonna work that way nor can i get all the seats up high enough
 	
 	
 		right
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		to do that so uh so on those we just we just forget about
 	
 	
 		yeah that certainly helps
 	
 	
 		and we've been looking at <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> with leather seats but uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i don't know this is a new experience for us just just mainly because my uh my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> had died which meant that we were coming into some money that we could
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">splurge</ENAMEX> and buy a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> but but yet it's difficult to do though when you're not used to it so that's why we're we're out uh
 	
 	
 		oh and isn't that nice
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		sort of doing this and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah buying a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> is hard you never know for sure if you're getting a good deal
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well we've always bought used <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> before and they haven't been very expensive um so this is just just a new
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		a new thing you know we've had vans we've had a new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">van</ENAMEX> and you know some other another new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> that that wasn't used but the prices are what

 		used to buy a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> for
 	
 	
 		yeah oh i know because we came down here and you know and well you know from down here it but price of housing is a lot different
 	
 	
 		um-hum i bet
 	
 	
 		but the but the price of our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> up in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aberdeen</ENAMEX> was as much as some <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> and it's like you know oh my goodness
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		right it's hard to adjust to it and and you just don't want to really
 	
 	
 		no because it's like this thing it moves moves and could be wrecked and that's like we you know get a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> for this and uh it just blows our mind um but
