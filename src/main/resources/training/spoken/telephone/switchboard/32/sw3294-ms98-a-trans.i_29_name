 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well let's see as far as i'm
 	
 	
 		so so what gets you
 	
 	
 		well the thing i think that annoys me the most is i have i have young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and and inevitably as soon as they're asleep
 		someone calls on the phone trying to sell me something and i think that that is probably the most
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		aggravating um it you know it invades my time i'm the one that pays for the phone um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		if i wanna buy something i'll take the initiative and and go find it you know and it that just really does aggravate me um what do you think
 	
 	
 		well i mean i  that's exactly the kind of thing i would have said although in my case it's my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> and i both work we come home
 		and just as we're preparing dinner or eating dinner the phone rings and it's one solicitation call after another and
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know
 	
 	
 		your time is is valuable and
 	
 	
 		yeah it's it's  like you say very annoying and um why why do we let this happen
 	
 	
 		oh i that's that's interesting i uh uh the market seems to just be growing too i i guess enough <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are not speaking out i'm not speaking out that's for sure i just get aggravated about it and
 	
 	
 		would would you  mean if you could legislate something what would you legislate
 	
 	
 		i really don't know i'm i'm not into  um heavy government legislating legislating of a lot of different <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">areas</ENAMEX> but i
 		i don't know i just i do particularly find it annoying um
 		i really not sure i haven't given that a lot of thought if if it should should go you know to be
 	
 	
 		yeah it it seems it seems to me that we should have the ability to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designate</ENAMEX> with the phone <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> that we don't wanna receive calls like that
 	
 	
 		well that yeah that might
 	
 	
 		and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> making these calls would be obliged to compare compare
 	
 	
 		identify themselves yeah
 	
 	
 		the their lists that they're gonna call against this list of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who don't wanna be called
 	
 	
 		right
 		that would be a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">an</NUMEX> an interesting ways yeah
 	
 	
 		um
 		and that that way those who want it can have it and those who don't want it don't have to have it
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		sort of like an unlisted number where you haven't gone to the trouble of enlisting yourself except even unlisted numbers aren't safe now because they have these things just sort of dial through all the numbers
 	
 	
 		right just
 		oh is that right oh well that's interesting
 	
 	
 		um automatically and
 	
 	
 		and they just get everybody huh oh boy
 	
 	
 		bright
 	
 	
 		well i i do wish that it would stop on my end because it it seems to happen at the worst possible moments
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i i guess the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next one</TIMEX> is is door-to-door <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">solicitors</ENAMEX> i don't mind the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> when they're selling things for school i have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> and you know that's just kind of  part of it but when
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> selling a variety of things and especially when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> arrive at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about ten o'clock in the morning</TIMEX>  um that really it just makes you not feel particularly safe and it's annoying as well
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yes
 		and these and these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> may in fact be just looking to steal find an unoccupied <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> to rob
 	
 	
 		right you just you really don't know so i i find myself being a little a bit abrupt and a little bit ruder than  than i might normally be but i i do feel like it's a an invasion of my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">space</ENAMEX> and uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 		what about these telephone <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">callers</ENAMEX> sometimes  they're door-to-door but usually they're telephone <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">callers</ENAMEX> who who want you to basically help them fill out a questionnaire
 	
 	
 		i've never quite understood the purpose of that yeah i uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well i think these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are hired by from from different sources
 	
 	
 		just to keep
 	
 	
 		um  with you know and so therefore there's no one answer but but
 		yeah sometimes it's a market survey basically it's a market survey but they never say who who they're really working for or what  you know what what what questions are you know
 	
 	
 		just a survey
 		yeah
 		there've been a couple of times when the it the uh whatever the subject was i guess caught my interest and i went along with it and then there have been several times when i just said well i just really don't have the time
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know to deal with it at that moment
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but um i don't get too many of those i've had just a few
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um generally someone's trying to sell me something or
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right well  and sometimes that's this is just the lead in to a sales pitch too
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		other times it's you know wasting your time to collect the data they want for their
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right with
 	
 	
 		marketing purpose for which if they would just pay me enough money i would be willing to consider but but a dollar isn't it you know it's  uh
 	
 	
 		yeah that's right
 		oh well
 	
 	
 		and i also sort of worry that you know that sometimes <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> give away personal information um
 		when when the call comes and and they uh uh you know  sort of seductive to you know somebody's asking me my opinion on all of these things and so i start answering and then you you know you go down a path um
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right
 	
 	
 		and you don't know where it's gonna end uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		in fact you don't even know what you've eventually you know the totality of what you've revealed and you know
 	
 	
 		well we
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		this isn't you know probably most likely not to going to be used against you but it could and
 	
 	
 		yeah you just never know i guess
 	
 	
 		and that seems to be something that should should really be outlawed
 	
 	
 		that yeah i i
 	
 	
 		because it's subject to abuse and it
 	
 	
 		asking for information is is i can't really see that
 		i think they ought to if if if if nothing else they ought to spend money for a postage stamp and you know  when it arrives at your <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> oh i
