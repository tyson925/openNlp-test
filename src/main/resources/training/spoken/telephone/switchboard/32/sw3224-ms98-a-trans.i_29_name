 		uh well i have this uh huge kitchen <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cabinet</ENAMEX> that uh it was like an old cabinet my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> from was built in nineteen oh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so i have this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cabinet</ENAMEX> that had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about eight</NUMEX> layers of paint on it and i stripped it down and i'm still working on it for about it's been <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about a year</TIMEX> that i've been working on it
 	
 	
 		oh my
 	
 	
 		it's beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">moldings</ENAMEX> and a beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cabinet</ENAMEX> and as soon as i'm done with it it should be good
 	
 	
 		ah
 	
 	
 		we use like a heat gun to strip it and then uh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemicals</ENAMEX> to get the rest of the paint out of the crevices and stuff like that
 	
 	
 		do you do all this in your house
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah it's it's it's uh it's probably movable the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cabinet</ENAMEX> but it would be tough to move i was able to take some of the pieces apart it's like a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen</ENAMEX> pantry basically
 	
 	
 		oh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh
 	
 	
 		i was able to take some of the pieces apart like some of the shelves out to clean them out independently and stuff
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> that's an ambitious project
 	
 	
 		yeah a little too ambitious
 	
 	
 		had you ever done any refinishing before
 	
 	
 		no i'd done nothing like it before but a neighbor of ours had done this and it looked uh looked nice so we figured we'd try it ourselves
 	
 	
 		oh
 		so the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX> was able to give you guidance
 	
 	
 		um a little bit she didn't tell us she did say it was gonna be hard work  she was right she was right
 	
 	
 		yeah  and she was right
 		yes
 	
 	
 		so uh what kind of work do you do you do any  you do anything like that or what are your hobbies
 	
 	
 		well uh i do a lot of needlework
 		and i also do puzzles for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazines</ENAMEX> i get paid for this i've written two puzzle books
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh</ENAMEX> and so in my free time even though it's not a hobby and that i do get paid for it i'm always developing new puzzles and activities and and word games mind benders that type of thing
 	
 	
 		crossword you do crossword puzzles mostly or or
 	
 	
 		no they're they're variety type puzzles
 		uh not crosswords just all different kinds find the hidden word and um you know anagram type puzzles acrostic cryptograms
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh  mostly for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> but some of them go up through grade twelve
 		so and i've developed a lot of my own type of puzzles like <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">word snakes</ENAMEX> and grid graphs and things like that so that's what published so  if i have free time i'm usually sitting down with uh graph paper doing some puzzles
 	
 	
 		is that what you do for a living or you do other things
