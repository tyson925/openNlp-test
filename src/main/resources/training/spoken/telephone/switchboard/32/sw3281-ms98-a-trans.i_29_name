 
     		
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">okay Diane</ENAMEX> and a very good <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> to you
 	
 	
 		
 
 		and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon good afternoon</TIMEX> to you
 	
 	
 		do you uh do most of your cooking at home or do you uh have a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> come in and have to prepare for them
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um no i do most of my cooking at home and um i could safely say that i have never cooked for a dinner party
 	
 	
 		ah my goodness  well what would you uh like to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cook</ENAMEX> what's what what what is your favorite uh recipes uh that you would like to have for a dinner <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> now you're in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> is it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um
 		
 
 		uh right i'm in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> of course um dinner parties down here probably
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		oh turn out to be more things like barbecues  and
 	
 	
 		i was i was thinking in terms of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> almost Tex-Mex Tex-Mex
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yes yeah uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tex-Mex Tex-Mex</ENAMEX> uh <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> food um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		probably a little bit different than what you serve up in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> for a dinner party
 	
 	
 		well that's a very interesting food though and when i go out to eat dinner sometimes that's the type of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> i like to find we have uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		right
 	
 	
 		i think  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chico</ENAMEX>'s or or these different <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> in this area that uh have all those fine <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> but um if i were to cook uh a dinner party
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh it may be standard to you but uh actually i never get too much fried chicken
 	
 	
 		fried chicken
 	
 	
 		but i would have fried chicken um  with reasonably hot <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sauce</ENAMEX> on it almost a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> type thing
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i love twice cooked <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">potatoes</ENAMEX> have you ever had twice cooked <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">potatoes</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh yes i have
 	
 	
 		with with the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cream</ENAMEX> made of the the sour <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cream</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cream cheese</ENAMEX> and uh little oleo and i use uh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oregano</ENAMEX> and maybe <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">dill weed</ENAMEX> on mixed in with it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		right
 	
 	
 		and uh i like broccoli casseroles
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		which would include onion and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cheese</ENAMEX> and again more <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">dill weed</ENAMEX> and some medium hot peppers as you can see i'm inclined towards the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> type of a meal
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		right
 	
 	
 		and i would probably have some quiet and gentle fried onion rings mixed in there with it too
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so  uh how would you improve upon that
 	
 	
 		improve upon that let's see
 		i'd probably put a bunch of fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetables</ENAMEX> in
 	
 	
 		more fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetables</ENAMEX> included to that
 	
 	
 		and some  yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">uh</ENAMEX> green <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beans</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">um carrots</ENAMEX> and things like that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		how do you cook your green beans
 	
 	
 		my green <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beans</ENAMEX> um i just get fresh green <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beans</ENAMEX> from the grocery <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX> and snap off the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ends</ENAMEX> and put them in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> and steam them for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about ten minutes</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 		so you
 	
 	
 		and i like to put a little Mrs Dash in with them
 	
 	
 		all right that's what i was wondering about what what you use and and and  herbs and so forth
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		right uh-huh um i like to just put
 		a tablespoon or so of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Mrs Dash</ENAMEX> in there and it makes them pretty tasty
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		have you ever tried <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> type green beans
 	
 	
 		the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> type are they the real
 	
 	
 		we use soy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sauce</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		no i haven't ever used that
 	
 	
 		well you might uh be interested in that have it gives a very delicious taste you you have a soy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sauce</ENAMEX> taste and you also have a little <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cream sauce</ENAMEX> in there because you you would use the water and um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		golly what's this white <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">powder</ENAMEX> that that uh
 		that you mix with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> and gives a thick <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sauce</ENAMEX> and i can't even think of the name of that right at the moment
 	
 	
 		a white powder
 		um
 		gosh
 	
 	
 		anyhow sorry about my mind but uh it does make a nice thick creamy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sauce</ENAMEX> with the green <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beans</ENAMEX> and then you have the nice soy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sauce</ENAMEX> taste under it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that's okay
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		with a few onions in there with it it does it it brings out such a so much different things in uh in the string beans
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i like i like it to try them differently i hardly ever cook them the same way twice
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		just so i can enjoy them
 		so you might uh think about that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chinese</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah i might try that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> cooking actually has a lot of very delicious tastes to them
 	
 	
 		oh yes i love <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chinese</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh north <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> cooking is good when you use something called couscous
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">North African</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and that's uh made from uh semolina i think they call it beans
 		and that's the type of something that whatever you mix with it this couscous
 		uh absorbs the taste of whatever else you put in it with it makes a very delicious <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dish</ENAMEX> you probably probably have to buy that from specialty stores
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		C <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">O U S C O U S</ENAMEX> and that's a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a</NUMEX> north <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dish</ENAMEX> they eat it one to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meals</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Africa</ENAMEX>
