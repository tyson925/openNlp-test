 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Midwest</ENAMEX> north you know we're right on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lake Erie</ENAMEX>
 		uh i'm sure our climates are much different than yours are
 		typically <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> we've got uh rain we're forecasting a little bit of sleet
 		and uh which means i'm not gonna do any lawn and gardening <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> that's for sure
 	
 	
 		yes i can understand
 	
 	
 		so i don't know what's the weather down there and
 	
 	
 		oh it's nice and sunny here uh it's uh little little <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> uh crispness in the air
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh delightful to be outside
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and right now i'm watering
 	
 	
 		yeah it's not
 		are you really   we avoid having to send you a little bit
 	
 	
 		yes
 		and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">lawn</ENAMEX> is very green and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> are still blooming
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		well i have that
 	
 	
 		oh you do
 	
 	
 		i still have that we have mums and geraniums that are still holding their own out there uh lot of the other ones i've i've already had to pull out
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh at this point i'm ready to start putting in uh some bulbs i'm waiting for a decent some decent weather for that i got uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about two hundred</NUMEX> bulbs i've got to put in
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		right
 	
 	
 		but i have a uh
 		mine's a new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> and we just really did the landscaping <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> so i've got
 		about all the gardening i want for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> so i'll be anxious to to let it rest for a little bit
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but uh somebody i talked to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX> was said they had the uh they had problems doing some of the work down there because they they really had some heat hanging on
 	
 	
 		well course that's a constant factor down here what you have to do is uh keep your uh keep your ground uh watered
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh the heat really doesn't bother you if you have the right kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah all right
 	
 	
 		or and the right kind of lawn for that matter
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i have a tiff <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bermuda</ENAMEX> lawn here and uh it requires a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> and you have to keep it cut very short if you want it to look like a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">golf course</ENAMEX> green
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i don't uh get to it that often so mine doesn't look like a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">golf course course</ENAMEX> but it is very nice and uh and shiny and uh very thin grass
 	
 	
 		oh i see
 	
 	
 		grows real close together
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		that's very okay it's very very different than ours because ours ours we get into a lot of combinations of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rye</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kentucky Blue</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh plus the usual amount of crabgrass and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">weeds</ENAMEX> and everything else that pops through and
 		uh but we've had an a terrible drought <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> and everybody's going through the same kind of problems in fact we developed on a new lawn we developed what they call rust
 		and it's a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fungus</ENAMEX> which is very very rare but our whole area they're all new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> and new <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">lawns</ENAMEX> and it was it was very
 		very much in evidence <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> as everything turns yellow
 	
 	
 		turns yellow early huh
 	
 	
 		well it just turns yellow where it shouldn't and you walk across walk across the lawn and your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shoes</ENAMEX> will actually come out rust colored
 	
 	
 		and it's it's not it's not a disease it's a disease and not a lack of a of chemicals
 	
 	
 		no it's it's a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fungus</ENAMEX> and they claim that it is caused by <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX> to the lawn it it won't kill the lawn but it sure doesn't do much for the looks of the lawn
 	
 	
 		huh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh the alternative is a lot of uh nitrogen overpowering with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nitrogen fertilizer</ENAMEX> and
 		certain chemicals but everybody is so chemical shy anymore that we steered clear of it and hopefully you know come spring come <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">spring</TIMEX> it will be cleared up and everything will be back to normal
 	
 	
 		well i have grub <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worms</ENAMEX> here off and on i try to keep them under control they live right up under the surface of the ground and they eat the roots of your grass and then you have ground  brown uh patches develop
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		that's when you first notice it but you can put some uh chemical on that and kill them out and keep them under control you never destroy them
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		you enjoy lawn work
 	
 	
 		oh very much so uh we have a lake <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> down at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Cedar Creek Texas seventy</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">five miles uh</NUMEX> north uh or rather uh uh southeast uh southeast of uh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh i have to  to grow uh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rye</ENAMEX> grass down there because we're not there to water although we have a watering system no one's there to turn it on and i guess uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		well we don't have an automatic sprinkler either see so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> or automatic on the sprinkler system
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but uh you know the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rye</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">grass</ENAMEX> and the uh wild grass that grow makes us a nice lawn
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah it sounds nice <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Cedar Lake</ENAMEX> i'm not uh
 	
 	
 		but
 		oh it's a very large uh man-made lake uh in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> it's about uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred</NUMEX> and uh fifty miles i guess in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fort Worth</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh i see
 	
 	
 		and it supplies <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fort Worth</ENAMEX> with it's drinking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		okay okay
 	
 	
 		and then <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred and eighty</NUMEX> miles further south of there uh or rather <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred and eighty</NUMEX> miles from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fort Worth</ENAMEX> about
 		<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">forty</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">miles</NUMEX> south of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cedar Creek</ENAMEX> is another mammoth lake that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fort Worth</ENAMEX> owns
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		that it uses to water
 	
 	
 		yeah that's interesting i never realized the uh the amount of lake
