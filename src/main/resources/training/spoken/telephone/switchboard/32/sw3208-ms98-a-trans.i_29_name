 
     		
 	
 		okay well basically  i  am a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> of a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three year old</TIMEX> so i can kind of relate to trying to find a good day care because it's uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		extremely hard thing to do to trust somebody else with your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> uh trust their emotional and their safety and all the rest of that and uh i've been pretty selective and what i'm finding is with um
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		day cares that are like day care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> like  for instance uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Learning Tree</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KinderCare</ENAMEX> and all of that what i find is that they're highly structured highly organized
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		almost too rigid for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> if you bring a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> in at a certain time
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh like nap time or whatever time uh because of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>' <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> they are differ and when i bring my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> into a such a system like that uh
 		they only have one thing going on that's nap time everybody's napping whether they came there <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an hour</TIMEX> before or they came at right during that time and with that kind of a system my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		just isn't likely to enjoy it if she has to good there immediately and lay down on a cot so um home day care has been an option and i've looked into that the only thing is you raise the question of
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		is it safe uh can you trust the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> you know um
 	
 	
 		that's right  and you never know i have um
 		an ex-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister-in-law</ENAMEX> that um currently has a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> abuse case on a home babysitter
 	
 	
 		sure oh sure sure that's really scary and to the point that you kind of say to yourself especially home day care i mean i think center day cares there's so many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> coming in and out
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		right
 	
 	
 		that you're better off if you're going to put a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> into that type of system for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">eight hours</TIMEX> it's fine it depends on the age of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> now some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> do real well that are at the age of
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four or five</NUMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> that have been in that kind of system for a while but home teaching  home day care <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">works well</ENAMEX> if it's an infant if it's
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		if it's if you wanna have kind of like a family structuring where there's a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> that they can  be provided because i've seen things at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> care where they can't keep up with all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> have
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		right
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">colds</ENAMEX> and they're sick all the time and the
