 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">okay</ENAMEX> and uh i i missed a part of it we're to talk about what <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">lawns</ENAMEX> and gardens
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">lawn</ENAMEX> and garden work and what you enjoy and what kind of work you do i'm i'm a putterer i chose that topic because i really like gardening as far as <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">shrubs</ENAMEX> and just keeping a pretty yard
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		i well it's it's it's very  strange strange that i got this call because my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> just called me i was just in the shower after finishing mowing the lawn
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and you know mowing the lawn and removing some old petunias out of the garden this type of thing is working right in to start planting fall fall bulbs
 	
 	
 		um-hum we've had a late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fall</TIMEX> it seems like the weather in fact <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> it's really warm and so many of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> are still pretty enough that you hate to pull them up but you know you need to pretty soon
 	
 	
 		uh
 		right that's the way this was the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the petunias</TIMEX> were really great our mums are are beautiful
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		uh i don't know if we i don't think we've had a frost up here i've been i was down <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Orleans</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a week</TIMEX> so i don't know what happened <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh but uh it seems like it's
 		oh i don't know if it's late i'm sort of waiting for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> Summer so i can get a lot of stuff down out here
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um i i enjoy it we came here we just moved into this well we moved in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November</TIMEX> and put all all the landscaping in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this this year</TIMEX> we came from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nine years</TIMEX> in a condo
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> and working in that condo you didn't have to do anything you know unless you really wanted to so
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		so now you have the chance to really create and and spread out
 	
 	
 		right you know i've had this is my
 		<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> i think i've owned
 		um but uh it's interesting the only the only problem is that i do quite a bit of traveling and it sort of gets away from me if you're not with it so but uh i i enjoy
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		most of it and about this time of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> there is it starts getting a little old and i start looking forward to you know having other things to do with my
 	
 	
 		the grass not growing so fast
 	
 	
 		ah well it is it is for me because i've been doing a lot of fertilizing we had a terrible <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> we had a drought
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and uh took a lot of watering and a lot of fertilizing and now it's really growing and i'm trying to establish a good root root growth you know for the winter
 	
 	
 		hm ours seems to have slowed down here we're not having to mow <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every week</TIMEX> religiously
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		but we're still fighting bugs and ready to change some of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> out i still have caladiums that are pretty which is a surprise this late in the year
 	
 	
 		uh
 		oh really um yeah
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		but like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> it's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eighty five</NUMEX> degrees it's really strange
 	
 	
 		oh yeah yeah i hear that from my brother-in-law lives in Plano
 	
 	
 		but that'll change real quick  then we'll wished we'd planted <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">bulbs</ENAMEX> and pansies already
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well he always
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		he waits until it gets <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about seventeen</NUMEX> below up here and then he calls us yeah it's seventy degrees here in the sunshine so
 	
 	
 		oh my gosh
 		well <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> has gotten to where it's a real problem as far as <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> because our <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summers</TIMEX> are so terribly hot
 	
 	
 		oh i yeah
 	
 	
 		and we have ice storms <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every year</TIMEX> and there just aren't that many <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">shrubs</ENAMEX> that can take both of those extremes some of the things that used to be hardy are getting to where they don't make it through the two swings
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah that is i was you know i was like conditioned to it they're they're have to be hardened to it already yeah that's uh that's strange with me
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know you think
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> you know almost semitropical you wouldn't have that kind of that kind of problem but
 	
 	
 		well for the most part we don't but we have usually just a pocket of really bad hot and really bad cold well <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summers</TIMEX> have gotten where they're a lot hotter
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but the the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> storms really are stressful on all the the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> that we have around we've noticed that crepe myrtles don't do as well as they used to
 	
 	
 		really oh do they
 	
 	
 		and uh pittosporum that used to be the kind of things we could plant all the time you you really take a chance with them freezing
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		i love
 		yeah i love the uh the landscaping like i say my brother-in-law lives in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Plano</ENAMEX> and i get to <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Carrollton</ENAMEX> quite a bit
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i go there on on business and i really enjoy getting around and seeing the different areas with different gardens and
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas Dallas</ENAMEX> is very nice i really enjoy it there the landscaping the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> the architecture the whole thing very enjoyable gardens and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> and i
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		except for the lack of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> out where we are  it was all <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cotton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">fields</ENAMEX> and when we get to other parts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> where the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> are so beautiful we really miss it
 	
 	
 		well
 		yeah that we have you know <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX>'s a a very pretty state we moved in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seventy six</TIMEX> we moved to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX> we lived there for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five years</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i remember the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time i took my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> there on a house hunt uh we were coming in and before the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> landed she looked out the window and she said she said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Randy</ENAMEX> there's no trees down there
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i said there are this is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Illinois</ENAMEX> you know and when we got out to the area where we decided decided we were going to live and buy a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> there were no <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> because the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmers</ENAMEX> had cleared all the land
 	
 	
 		hm
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and now all of a sudden it was being developed and the first thing i did was planted all kinds of trees
