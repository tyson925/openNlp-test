 
     		
 	
 		question was on lawn and garden work um how do you like it
 	
 	
 		well i don't do much of it here i'm from uh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> from uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colorado</ENAMEX> originally and there are no bugs there and i didn't mind getting in the dirt there but boy i'll tell you what once i see these bugs around here i'm just kind of out of it
 	
 	
 		ooh what kind do you have
 	
 	
 		oh roaches and oh yes <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cockroaches</ENAMEX> are awful here just awful  so i
 	
 	
 		do they really
 		oh oh and i know somebody that lives there and they never mentioned that problem
 	
 	
 		oh you're kidding you're kidding no it's a  well maybe they didn't mention it because it's just kind of a fact of life around here and uh
 	
 	
 		oh my they probably just take it for granted then
 	
 	
 		it it must be if they lived here a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> i know just say oh i just stomp on them it doesn't matter they make good <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fertilizer</ENAMEX> in the garden  me personally can't
 	
 	
 		ooh yuck  no i i don't have that problem uh it's <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mine</ENAMEX> is mainly we kind of have an understanding that uh i i said i'll do inside work you do outside work
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and so i get into the gardening part of it the fun part like putting in the annuals and things like that but i don't like i don't getting dirty
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		no i have to you know i have to say that's not exactly my favorite thing either really
 	
 	
 		no i don't know we got the we got the question and i thought oh this is gonna be interesting uh <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">two bits</NUMEX> i'll get a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> to talk to because they get stuck doing it all  but although i do know a lot of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> do like all the gardening work
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> we put in a new lawn in a new home so um we've been fighting a drought here <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this summer</TIMEX> and getting into fall <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> we just had
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		a lot of rain  yeah so it's kind of nice i don't know how yours has been
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		well it's been real hot here lately i mean we've had to actually have the air conditioning on and everything but uh  it's supposed to rain again now uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this weekend</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh i see okay well we're we're leaving <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX> and we're going down to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Orleans</ENAMEX> and from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX> since we're right near <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lake Erie</ENAMEX> this is gonna be a switch for us for a week
 	
 	
 		so then
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		going down there and i think we'll probably experience some of your weather although i think they have more humidity but um as far as the gardening and things like that goes i don't know uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		too much too much about uh how much i really really do enjoy it myself do you like it at all
 	
 	
 		i well not here i mean it's just here i just can't stand to even get out in the uh in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dirt</ENAMEX>  just
 	
 	
 		well how about when you were in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colorado</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		well i liked it a little bit but i didn't uh i was working at that time full time and didn't have a lot of time for that and so that i think really um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		hampered it a little bit
 	
 	
 		well and then and too now like where we had the dry <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> and we had to sprinkle constantly my <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> bill was
 		high and uh if you have that on regular basis in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> i think i would go with something very dry  to keep keep it off you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh and with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> um you probably don't have time anyhow to to get into it
 	
 	
 		no
 		not really  i'm fine
 	
 	
 		it's so uh okay very good i guess we've kind of covered our subject matter since neither one's really into gardening are we
 	
 	
 		sounds like it
 		no no afraid not hopefully they'll get a subject i like one of these times  something i really know a lot about well it's nice nice talking to you
 	
 	
 		right okay right nice talking with you um-hum bye
 	
 	
 		okay bye-bye
