 
     		
 	
 		okay uh my name is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karen</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 		okay my name is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Terry</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">okay</ENAMEX> and this uh they said about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazines</ENAMEX> we i've probably personally take i think just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> but that's because my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother-in-law</ENAMEX> takes every one they print and gives them to me <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a month later</TIMEX> so
 	
 	
 		okay
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so i get all of them uh the one that i really especially enjoy and you may be familiar with it from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wisconsin</ENAMEX> is called Country
 	
 	
 		oh yes uh there's <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Country Living</ENAMEX> there's <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Country</ENAMEX> and uh
 	
 	
 		well this yeah this one is the one that has all the pictures of scenery from places we wished we live like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wisconsin</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">gorgeous leaves</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> and all the lakes and the mountains and things and i get that it has recipes in it and that's my very favorite
 	
 	
 		sure
 		oh that's great
 	
 	
 		what do you take
 	
 	
 		well i actually take <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Country Living</ENAMEX> it's a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> magazine and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">House Beautiful</ENAMEX> because i like um that kind of stuff decorating and uh getting ideas for a garden in fact uh right before you called i was planning my tulips
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah decorating  uh-huh
 		are you
 	
 	
 		and uh putting them on blue print on where i'm gonna put them so i'm really into that but uh so i really get into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazines</ENAMEX> that are kind of basically into um housing type things whether it be
 	
 	
 		oh
 		and decorating and how to do things uh-huh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">decorating</ENAMEX> and gardening and recipes that kind of stuff so i'm pretty much in the same category as what you're looking at
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well we we tried for a while to take a news <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> we took <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX> and i think we took it especially just during the war to kind of catch up on everything and have it be digested but we've kind of discontinued that right now and we've we're gonna start taking that uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US News</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		sure
 		yeah
 		yeah yeah we i've had <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> before i think with that what happens is uh
 	
 	
 		uh newspaper <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA Today</ENAMEX> i think it is
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it's interesting to read but you kind of just put the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> away and you never read it again unless there's some big article in there that you're gonna keep for your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> but
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		that's right
 		that's exactly right i did the same thing we saved the ones from the election and we saved the ones from the war and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> from the earthquake  and then
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		it exactly you you sound exactly like what we did we just saved everything we could for our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> but uh
 	
 	
 		and um-hum uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that's pretty similar but i find that with these Country <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazines</ENAMEX> i keep going back to them getting ideas looking back and saying jeez there was a flower garden in there that i seen that i would like to have some ideas you know so you get a lot of ideas from them
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well you sound like you that's the thing you sound like you have the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> to do that
 	
 	
 		yes we do we're out in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> we're right across from a river and uh you're right the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">leaves</ENAMEX> are beautiful and they are falling now so uh it just peaked uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX> and it was just gorgeous out here but
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh
 		i bet it is gorgeous
 	
 	
 		yeah it's beautiful the other thing about magazines the only thing i don't like is they really get heavily into advertising and you know it's it's
 	
 	
 		i agree
 	
 	
 		it's fine i'd rather almost have i know that part probably <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> their money comes from these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that are saying
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh put my ad in your paper and i'll pay you or whatever but uh there's been some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazines</ENAMEX> i've looked at and it's a real turn off to see every other page uh some kind of ad
 	
 	
 		yeah right
 		every page i did the same thing i i think i opened Vogue <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the other day</TIMEX> or something and it was just nothing um-hum  and i thought why buy this  you know what's the point
 	
 	
 		yeah <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vogue</ENAMEX> is heavily into that you know yeah exactly it's almost i mean you could go into a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX> and get bombarded the same way but uh
 	
 	
 		that's right and my number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> pet <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">peeve</ENAMEX> in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> is when they put the perfume in it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		because uh real often i don't like very heavy perfumes and very often like you know in my bills also magazines and bills and they'll come out just stinking the whole thing
 	
 	
 		yeah exactly
 		
 
 		exactly yeah they're really getting into that so but pretty much like it said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazines</ENAMEX> i've had <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Better Homes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Garden</ENAMEX> and now i need a switch and i'm going back to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Gourmet Cooking</ENAMEX> because um i've had the magazine
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh
 	
 	
 		before back in nineteen uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eighty six</NUMEX> and i thought well i'll give it a try again because you get tired of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> and you need to try and change
 	
 	
 		i understand well do you  do you tear out of your magazine your recipes or do you keep it
 	
 	
 		uh yes i do and sometimes most of the time i tear them out a lot of times if uh you know if i got a chance to sit down at my typewriter i'll go ahead and type out recipes but
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		type it off uh-huh
 	
 	
 		what i usually do is i'll try it out in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazine</ENAMEX> first and uh without tearing it out and then give it a yeah and then if we like it it becomes part of the recipe collection but uh
 	
 	
 		see how the family liked it
 		oh that's a good idea well i'm gonna pay attention more when i'm in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX> to that <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Country Living</ENAMEX> i remember seeing the cover back when i decorated the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> with a lot of the little country uh primitive things
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		the little the little <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pigs</ENAMEX> and the geese and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ducks</ENAMEX> and that we had that was the big rage here <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">couple of years ago</TIMEX> and i bought a lot of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> magazines and then it seems like when i put some of that away i quit buying it but i had forgotten the recipes
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		sure sure
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i'm gonna i'll have to check that out
 	
 	
 		yeah it it that's what i i just went through uh we just recently moved from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minnesota</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wisconsin</ENAMEX> i went through all this i had this huge stack of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">House Beautiful i</ENAMEX> had Colonial Times i had Gourmet
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 		and you don't wanna part with any of them because there's one thing in each one
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		it was hard but i ended up uh reducing them down to like fifteen <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazines</ENAMEX> out of uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> and i just said okay there's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> picture in there that it really doesn't
 	
 	
 		oh that's good
 	
 	
 		you know it's got to have more than that it's got to have some good ideas it's got to have everything so i just kind of went through and i find that most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazines</ENAMEX> i really like is around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas time</TIMEX> because it helps me
 	
 	
 		uh-huh right
 		right
 		i i know
