 
     		
 	
 		this is an easy easy subject i i guess i watch too much TV that's
 	
 	
 		yeah i i watch a lot of television myself here lately i'm out of a job right now so
 		watch a lot of lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Jeopardy</ENAMEX> and cartoons

 		and uh generally the the channel <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> stuff that comes on <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Doogie Howser and Roseanne</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		stuff like that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		you don't have a real favorite or
 	
 	
 		a real favorite
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		probably <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Fresh Prince or Married With Children</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		they're your favorites huh they're pretty good oh it surprises me that yours aren't the same as <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mine</ENAMEX> and i thought i formed mine kind of with my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> so we've been <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MacGyver</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fans</ENAMEX> forever
 		and i don't know if you ever watch that  it's on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">nights</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh excuse me
 	
 	
 		we
 		we enjoy it mainly because it i think it has it's full of adventure and stuff like that
 	
 	
 		yeah i i watch that when i can usually i i go out right around then so i'm not home then
 	
 	
 		yeah and  we used to like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cosby</ENAMEX> real well but it it's kind of slacked off a little bit it's not one of our
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murphy Brown</ENAMEX> is always is good for several laughs we like that we watch <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Doogie</ENAMEX> quite often too
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last couple</TIMEX> we wondered if the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> should watch with and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">tonight</TIMEX>'s or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>'s sound pretty bad too so
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but uh we we watch and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LA Law</ENAMEX> is another one we probably watch if we can
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quantum Leap</ENAMEX> we have our our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">favorites</ENAMEX> of course i don't know what <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> they're all on probably different ones
 		that's kind of fun to watch too  are you watching the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World Series</ENAMEX> right now too or
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh yes i am actually i it's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first year</TIMEX> i've really been interested interested in baseball but i just  decided to pay attention here to the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the World Series</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i have a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> that lives in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minnesota</ENAMEX> so this kind of  been fun to watch and
 		they tried to get get tickets and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> the scalpers that were out wanted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred and fifty</NUMEX> per ticket
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that's getting tickets for something like that it's like trying to
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i don't know enter <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fort Knox</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah so i just read in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> where the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dynasty sequel um</ENAMEX> out rated the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World Series</ENAMEX> that really surprised me
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that's kind of strange
 	
 	
 		i didn't think i didn't care to watch that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dynasty</ENAMEX> at all i guess it depends on if you're a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dynasty</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fan</ENAMEX> or not
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah and now and now <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dynasty</ENAMEX> is again <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">tonight</TIMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World Series</ENAMEX> is back on again tonight
 	
 	
 		it will be interesting to see how many keep with it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		see if it was really that good or not but
 	
 	
 		i think what it is is everybody
 		excuse me everybody was looking to see the the fight between the the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> women
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		yeah they look like that's pretty good
 	
 	
 		that's a a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> of mine was taping it just so he could see this one fight and he taped the wrong day because it wasn't on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first day</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh gee oh well
 	
 	
 		so now he's got to tape tape it again <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> i think's when it comes back on
 	
 	
 		i think i'll stick with the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World Series</ENAMEX>  let them fight it out i don't
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i i never was much of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dynasty</ENAMEX> fan
 	
 	
 		no i i watched <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> at first when it first came on and then i lost interest in it too
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dynasty</ENAMEX> i just never did get into so but well i think that's all we need to discuss we have a few similar not too many and
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		now i'll have to watch one of yours and see if i like it so all right it was good talking to you bye-bye
