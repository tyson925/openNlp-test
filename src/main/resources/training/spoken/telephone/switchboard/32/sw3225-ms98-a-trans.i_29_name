 		we i end up with an old standby that we call <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chicken</ENAMEX> because it's so easy
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh it goes you have to cook very little to go with it just some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX> and some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salad</ENAMEX> and that's about it you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well what do you put in it
 	
 	
 		uh you make you just take your boneless <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chicken breasts</ENAMEX> and then you take and make a a dressing out of uh <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> dressing one bottle of that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and a package of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lipton Onion Soup</ENAMEX> mix
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">three ounces</NUMEX> of apricot preserves
 	
 	
 		ooh that sounds good
 	
 	
 		and you mix it up and you just put it on the top of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chicken</ENAMEX> and then i cover the pan with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foil</ENAMEX> and put it in the oven for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about an hour</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and then i take the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foil</ENAMEX> off and let it brown
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		takes <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about another twenty minutes</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and it's delicious
 	
 	
 		ooh that sounds good
 	
 	
 		and it's so simple because i can pop it in when i come in the door you know and then uh go about my business and by the time i've got everything else ready the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chicken</ENAMEX>'s ready chicken's done
 	
 	
 		is done right
 	
 	
 		so that's a real easy thing for me
 	
 	
 		yeah that sounds good too
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i've got a um  a great recipe for cheesecake
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		i don't know if you get <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southern Living</ENAMEX> that magazine
 	
 	
 		no i don't my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mom</ENAMEX> gets that but
 	
 	
 		they have one if you like to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cook</ENAMEX> they have every recipe i've tried out of that has been a really good one
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		and um you know <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every month</TIMEX> they've got all different kinds of recipes but
 		i got <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> in there <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about a year or so ago</TIMEX> on cheesecake and it's just a regular cheesecake and then you can put raspberry um topping on it but inside the cheesecake uh recipe you put um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">lemon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">peel</ENAMEX> and orange peel
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		and it's just enough to taste it you know when when when you're eating the cheesecake and it is wonderful but it takes a long time because you have to cook it for
 		<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">forty</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five minutes</TIMEX> and then you turn the oven off and you leave it in the oven for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">another forty five minutes</TIMEX> and then you open up the oven door and leave it in for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">another forty five minutes</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		hm
 		oh my goodness
 	
 	
 		and then you're supposed to um i think chill it to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> temperature
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so sometimes i'll do that <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">overnight</TIMEX> and then put the topping on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next day</TIMEX> but it's it's very good
 	
 	
 		well i love cheesecake i have never been i don't know the ones i have made i have not done that well with
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i like a baked <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cheesecake</ENAMEX> you know i don't i've had a recipe that someone has given me that it's kind of like you just <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mix cream cheese</ENAMEX> and stuff and refrigerate it you know but that's not the same as a a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> style cheesecake
 	
 	
 		right yeah
 		no no
 	
 	
 		and uh the recipes that i've used everybody will say oh this is real simple and then i make it and it's it's really not very good
 	
 	
 		it's not
 		right
 	
 	
 		but yours sounds good i bet that lemon and orange peel gives it a little bit of tartness
 	
 	
 		it does and it it it is really good
 	
 	
 		hm well that sounds interesting so there's your good <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dessert</ENAMEX> for your dinner party
 	
 	
 		it is it is pretty good
 		right
 	
 	
 		
 
 		are you into serving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wines</ENAMEX> with your dinner party
 	
 	
 		oh sometimes but i mean i'm not a wine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">connoisseur</ENAMEX> by any means
 	
 	
 		me either i wish i knew more about it
 	
 	
 		i've been to you know some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> tastings up in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Napa Valley</ENAMEX> but um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know and i learned a little bit about them then but you know what would be fun they have some of those classes you can take
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		they would be if you just had time to do it
 	
 	
 		and
 		yeah and then there's places um do you live in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> okay there's <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">places</ENAMEX> here that um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>

 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and then you get to eat everything afterwards and then they also go into the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wines</ENAMEX> you know to serve with you know different types of of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meals</ENAMEX> and that kind of thing and it sounds like it's a lot of fun we have some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> who've done that and they've really enjoyed it
