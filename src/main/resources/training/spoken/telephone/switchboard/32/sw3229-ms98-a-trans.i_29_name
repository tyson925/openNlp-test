 
     		
 	
 		okay while i was waiting for you to connect i i thought of a couple of menus i decided it'd to be if it's informal or not you know if it was informal i'd probably choose something i mean just like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hamburgers</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steaks</ENAMEX> out on the grill
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		because that's a lot of fun especially <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this time of year</TIMEX> where it's so nice out
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		um
 		it was formal i'd probably go with something like a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chicken</ENAMEX> breast or lasagna or something i'm not  i'm not into formal dinner <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> but
 	
 	
 		i see
 	
 	
 		i'd probably go with lasagna a green <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salad</ENAMEX> and garlic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bread</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so what what do you use for cookbooks
 	
 	
 		um i have a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pillsbury</ENAMEX> cookbook i got when i was married but it's kind of the bible of cooking for me then i have some from like church
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		that are more family recipes that are more useful  you know budget cookbooks but
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and of course you get a lot from when you're growing up
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um i cook a lot the same as as my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mom</ENAMEX> did of course i've added several different recipes but what would you serve or what would you
 	
 	
 		right
 		well i i i think we come from from different backgrounds um so the the
 	
 	
 		well that's good
 	
 	
 		i i i start with different you know have different perspectives that you are i find the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Joy of Cooking</ENAMEX> to be a remarkably useful book to to fall back on because it has almost everything in it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but on the other hand  it's not very inspiring uh it's a good reference when you need to dig something up
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		what we've find very useful is a a book called <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Thirty Minute Cookbook i</ENAMEX> think that's the title uh by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marion Burrows</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		uh which has recipes which allegedly can all be prepared in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> you know the whole meal
 	
 	
 		yeah that would be wonderful in these times
 	
 	
 		and so she's
 		yeah now now i i find that the cutting up of the food and all that really makes it take a little longer than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah either they're really fast or
 	
 	
 		but but they're but they're but they're interesting they're interesting menus um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		combinations that you wouldn't have normally thought of
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		what's one of your favorites
 	
 	
 		um gee the one i had most recently was was one that was had  she she describes as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Beard</ENAMEX>'s favorite um <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> menu or something and it consisted of
 		uh grilled kielbasa sausage um a
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">potato salad</ENAMEX> with olive oil
 		and uh some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tomatoes</ENAMEX> that had been chopped up with onions and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">curry powder</ENAMEX> and probably some yogurt was in there
 	
 	
 		wow sounds pretty good
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">um</ENAMEX> and that and that was you know that's that that's certain you can do in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but there are a whole lot of you know i mean i i would recommend you look at that book if you're if you are a busy person <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Thirty Minute Cookbook</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah those <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Thirty Minute Cookbook</ENAMEX>
 		that sounds fun i find a lot of the cookbooks that i don't know that you buy over the counter
 		ask for really strange ingredients or things i don't keep on hand all the time
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i have young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and our budget's set you know at this time but i want to use
 		simple recipes that i have things on hand i don't have to run to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX> to buy
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		or look for something i haven't heard of  so that's why sometimes i shy away from uh more of a traditional cookbooks but
 	
 	
 		yes yes
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but  well it was interesting talking to you it's a fun subject <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> is one of my favorite things too
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		anything else you wanted to add
 	
 	
 		well you had said dinner
 		you know you know what would i put together for a formal dinner we had we had some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">as recently as Saturday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> and and um
 	
 	
 		oh wow um-hum
 	
 	
 		put here here the inspiration was a combination of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Julia Child</ENAMEX> for the dessert
 		well you know a chocolate mousse recipe
 	
 	
 		um-hum that's good
 	
 	
 		and a sort of palate cookbook which has a recipe for a thing called <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chicken</ENAMEX> Marabella
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um which is this wonderful thing you can do um
 		basically you're <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">baking baking chicken</ENAMEX> in a in an open pan um having marinated it first hand my my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> did this part so i don't remember all the details but it's marinated in olive oil and some seasoning
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">um</ENAMEX> and cooked with some olives and some and some prunes uh there's a little bit of brown <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sugar</ENAMEX> in there and it bakes up it's a delicious thing and it's easy
 	
 	
 		that sounds good
 	
 	
 		comparatively so i
 	
 	
 		that sounds really good
 	
 	
 		um
 		i'm sorry i just love food
 	
 	
 		it sounds like you <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> are a little more gourmet than i am i'm pretty simple right now but
 	
 	
 		well maybe we had a little more leisure time to do it i don't know
 	
 	
 		yeah that's probably that's true i have little ones and we and they won't eat you know too many different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> right now so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i found my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> were very frustrating when they were little
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		in terms of their tastes
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		on the other hand sometimes it was easy they'd you know canned <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ravioli</ENAMEX> was was one of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">favorites</ENAMEX> and so it was easy to
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah spaghetti's a pretty  staple <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every other week or so  so</TIMEX> and it goes a long ways too so
 	
 	
 		open a can of ravioli or
 		yes
 		well nice talking to you <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheryl</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		all righty we'll talk to you later maybe
 	
 	
 		okay bye
