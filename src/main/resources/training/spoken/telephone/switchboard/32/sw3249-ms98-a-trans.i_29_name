 
     		
 	
 		okay um do you have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> of your own
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah got uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh you do what ages are they
 	
 	
 		yeah uh let's see uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fourteen</NUMEX> twelve
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one and a half</NUMEX> i was yeah how about you
 	
 	
 		oh my you sound like a busy parent
 		i have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven year old</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three and a half</NUMEX>  <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mine</ENAMEX> are both girls
 	
 	
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven year old</TIMEX>  okay i've got <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> the oldest one's a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> others are are girls
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh do you and your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> both work
 	
 	
 		no huh-uh no she um my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> stays home
 	
 	
 		well that's nice i
 	
 	
 		yeah how about you how about yourself
 	
 	
 		i stay home too  yeah to me that's the ideal situation but i did work part-time when i had just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> and uh i'm pretty picky about my criteria of child care i
 	
 	
 		do you huh
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i don't care too much for day care <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> and preschool well you know <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> where the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> stay <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all day</TIMEX> long
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and so i i think the thing that i would think was most important is is if they're getting that individual attention that they need from an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult</ENAMEX> and i don't think they get enough of it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		so what would you what is there a certain ratio that would scare you off or of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mine</ENAMEX>'s pretty low too uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX> that i left my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> with only kept only had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> besides my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> so <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> to one i felt comfortable with
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i think if it got much more than that i would start feeling like someone was gonna be left out
 	
 	
 		
 
 		so you're talking now now you're pretty well limited to to home care then someone someone taking your your your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX> into their home yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right i don't think well i think once my uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> got to be maybe <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four years old</TIMEX> i might feel a little better about a larger group setting
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but up until that time both of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> had such passive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personalities</ENAMEX> that if they had been around a whole lot of other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> i really think they would have been
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know taken for granted  some of the other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> would have pushed them around and um  probably taken advantage of them a little bit what do you think
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		um-hum  um  i guess i ideally um uh i would if i if my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> had to go to work we'd probably look for a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> where the ratio of of uh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">um adults</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> was was you know low and i don't think you won't find that in a in a  commercially run day care what was that beep
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		no
 		no
 		oh i didn't even hear one no it might have been i have call waiting but if so i'll just try later  that's fine
 	
 	
 		did you
 		you didn't
 		so do i
 		okay
 		um  what so what what were we saying that um
 	
 	
 		yeah you said that uh you would like if your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> had to go back to work you probably would prefer that they stayed in a home
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah because how can you um  you know did you see the did you see the um i think it was on it was either <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twenty Twenty</NUMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">60 Minutes</ENAMEX> about that the day care in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Louisiana</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and it looked when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> visited it looked like um that everything looked fine and they told them <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> ratio of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> and and and that appeared to be what what the case when they were there but then
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		right
 	
 	
 		then uh it turned out that uh so how do you protect yourself against that i wonder
 	
 	
 		yeah i don't know see i feel real sorry for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couples</ENAMEX> where both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are you know have to work to make ends meet because you're kind of
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know stuck there i i know that um  if i had to go to work right now i would really have a hard time finding someone
 		because i babysitters are just really hard to come by and especially real good ones and you know ones that uh don't keep that many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and give them the individual attention that i think they need and that kind of thing
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so i would really be hard pressed to find something that i felt like was quality child care
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so i don't know i feel real sorry for you know working moms that are really looking hard and trying to do a good job with their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>
 		i'm just thankful i'm able to stay home  it makes the choice a lot easier
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well we've been my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> has stayed home uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fourteen years</TIMEX> now and it yeah it's not always been easy
 	
 	
 		wow that's great
 		oh i know
 	
 	
 		um to do because there are many times when another salary would be real helpful
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah oh yeah we feel that way i mean even now it's really hard to make ends meet even with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> so i can imagine with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but you learn how to to stretch money  how to use hand-me-downs and that kind of thing really makes a big difference too
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but i don't know i uh i worked at a little preschool it was a private one you know like a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> sponsored type thing where it was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">only two days a week Tuesday</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> from like <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> till two
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and even that i was not totally satisfied with the way the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> were treated uh
 	
 	
 		yeah my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> worked at a has worked at a couple of those too and she's never
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		never been uh um satisfied with with uh with what the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> were were getting and and and then she worked um not to long ago for just
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		filling in she filled in at a real large commercial commercially run where there were like i don't know how many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> there were but it was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twenty</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> in a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> and i don't know how many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> they had but um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		oh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		she didn't
