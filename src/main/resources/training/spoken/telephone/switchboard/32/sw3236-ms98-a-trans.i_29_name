 
     		
 	
 		why don't you go ahead and say what you feel and then i'll respond
 	
 	
 		all right well i'm uh i'm very guilty of of not doing my part with recycling i'm afraid we um recently moved here from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Carolina</ENAMEX> and
 		they had curbside recycling and it was very easy
 		
  
 		put everything out there but we don't have it in at least in our neighborhood right now
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh so i've been very guilty about not making the effort to to take things where they belong
 	
 	
 		well how long have you been here
 	
 	
 		well we've been here since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January</TIMEX>  so we we still feel very new but i it's working up to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> now so  i guess we're old-timers compared to some people
 	
 	
 		well
 		yeah
 		
 
 		yeah i think that's a good excuse you need to get into the  the system a little more and know where to take things
 	
 	
 		uh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		we've been here probably <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two and a half years</TIMEX> and
 		and we didn't recycle at all before we came so i think we're doing well we we've saved most of our <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aluminum</ENAMEX> cans and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glass</ENAMEX> and newspaper right now
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		where do you take those things
 	
 	
 		well the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">um glass</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX> we usually take to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wal-Mart</ENAMEX>
 		they have um in behind <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wal-Mart</ENAMEX> they have bins
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and then we usually save up our cans and and change them in for money
 	
 	
 		where do you do that because we've been saving cans for my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">choir um</ENAMEX> but i didn't know where to take them
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		um there's a place on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parker Road</ENAMEX> um it's just over the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">overpass</ENAMEX> before you get like to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KMart</ENAMEX> i think there's a a service <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX> there there's usually a semi truck
 		that has a a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> there that will weigh them and
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		now they aren't worth much right now but  it's better than nothing so and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		better than nothing right
 	
 	
 		what i hear a lot of neighborhoods do have the the pickup now and we hopefully we'll be getting them in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the month of October</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah i it seems like ever since we've moved here we've been hearing that you know it's coming in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of months</TIMEX> but
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah and  i think it's been delayed i think it was originally scheduled for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February</TIMEX> but the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trucks</ENAMEX> that were supposed to do it there's been some problems with
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		from what i've read in you know the mail that we get and i can't wait for that that will be easy i get tired of newspaper littering the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garage</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah yeah it gets to be a bit much before  haul it off but
 	
 	
 		i feel guilty we don't recycle our our <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk</ENAMEX> containers because they seem like a big waste
 	
 	
 		well they do yeah they they're a lot of bulk anyway and yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah yeah they fill up the whole kitchen garbage pail so i'll be glad when the bins do come and i think that's when i'll i'll start doing the plastic too
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah it was real easy with the bins it really was and it was it was just no effort at all um no more trouble than taking out the garbage so um i
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i've gotten used to washing the you know the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">um salad</ENAMEX> dressing bottles and things like that it's not that big of a deal i mean it's nicer to just throw them out but we can do our part take an extra minute or two
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah yeah
 		well how much do you earn on the cans i i didn't know how what kind of an idea to give her for
 	
 	
 		oh when we first were were here it was like we'd take maybe a oh a grocery sack full or maybe <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> grocery sacks full and it'd be like <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> dollars
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but since last time we've gotten more like a dollar
 	
 	
 		so it's gone down yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah which is understandable i think more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are are recycling but  that's something that we we don't really make any effort to
 	
 	
 		right yeah
 	
 	
 		and whatever pop we drink we used to take the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> out for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bike</ENAMEX> ride and pick up the litter you know the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">the</NUMEX> cans and that was kind of fun but we haven't done that for a long time
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		well that sounds like a pretty good project well
 	
 	
 		well the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> think it's fun plus you get your exercise and you  you do get to stop once in a while when there is a can to rest so but
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh  well i'll i'll have to kick myself and and get get on it my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX> across the street um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		is so careful about  recycling and so i
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		keep telling myself i'll i'll get it organized but maybe maybe they'll beat me and and do the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> wide <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> and
 	
 	
 		well hopefully the bins will be here in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this month</TIMEX> and that will spur you on so  all right well it sounds like we're doing our part and at least starting so
 	
 	
 		right right i don't have any excuse then that's for sure
 		thinking about it anyway yeah but  well um have you do they time this thing for us or do we
 	
 	
 		yeah trying  that's all you can do so that
 		um yeah you can do it as long as you want they you know if it's been long enough <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five minutes</TIMEX> is is when they cut in and say
 		say we don't have anymore room for recording so so we can say good-bye now it was good talking to you and maybe we'll get on line again  thanks <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sherry</ENAMEX> bye-bye
 	
 	
 		you can't you can't chat <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all day</TIMEX> huh  okay
 		okay bye-bye
