 
     		
 	
 		okay we're talking about capital punishment
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right
 	
 	
 		how do you feel about that Lenore
 	
 	
 		i am very much for capital punishment
 	
 	
 		well wonderful i am too <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one hundred</NUMEX> percent
 	
 	
 		my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> retired from the federal prison of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bureaus</ENAMEX> and i've been raised around
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		prison
 		prisons all my life and i believe if you don't have a punishment befitting the crime there's not any deterrent
 	
 	
 		all your life huh uh-huh
 		there's no deterrent
 		that's right there's just no deterrent
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		and so many of those kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> uh they got they have a better life in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prison</ENAMEX> than they have on the street anyway so you know unless they really make it rough on them that's not a going to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prison</ENAMEX> for a little while is not much of a deterrent i don't think
 	
 	
 		especially not a federal prison
 	
 	
 		right well i don't know what the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oklahoma</ENAMEX>'s laws are but <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> is i don't know our
 		i don't know it's it's no ones fault i mean it's not the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judges</ENAMEX> fault i don't think it's just the way the law is down here
 		man our crimes our uh <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prisons</ENAMEX> are so crowded that uh they can commit some pretty serious crimes and be set free within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		well see we were under uh the state <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prisons</ENAMEX> were under a mandate to
 		uh it was over crowded and the federal came in and said hey you know you have either got to build more <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prisons</ENAMEX> or let <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> go
 	
 	
 		well that's what ours did same thing
 	
 	
 		and finally our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX> at the time which who is not in office <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">now</TIMEX> came in and said okay where we draw the line is no sex <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">offenders</ENAMEX> will be let
 		loose under early bail you know or early uh  out but uh we have
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		the death penalty is not given often
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but there have been
 	
 	
 		it's not here either really
 	
 	
 		and you know i maybe it should be
 		uh
 		well it should be given you know i i won't say sparingly but i do believe it should be befitting the crime
 	
 	
 		i do too and and you know but the way the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX> are set up they've they've got so many chances for appeal but i think that i think it needs to be expedited you know if they've been convicted and given them appeal
 		and they're still convicted of of a crime that's deserving of of a lethal injection let's do it and not waste <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">so many years</TIMEX> to do it
 	
 	
 		right course you know they're they're entitled to a speedy trial
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		but then they're they're also entitled to drag it through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> on appeals so somehow you know it doesn't really balance out too much
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 		that's right somehow it just doesn't it works and then again it takes too long for it to work
 	
 	
 		and it seems even though you know that they got the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoner</ENAMEX> himself can come to the point that hey i'm tired i just want out
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know i'm tired of fighting it then the system just keeps on
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		um-hum yeah
 	
 	
 		and at that point you know i i really think there needs to be maybe a shorter
 	
 	
 		yeah it it was
 	
 	
 		appeal process
 	
 	
 		i do too i think that needs to and i don't see why it couldn't be shortened considerably but you know
 	
 	
 		well part of that is the overcrowding of the court system
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true it is overcrowded because there's so much drug uh
 		problem with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> because that they with the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> they're they're robbing and killing and uh that's why it's filled the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prisons</ENAMEX> up so much i think
 	
 	
 		uh it doesn't it doesn't help them any at all and course your court system when you get into the appeals
 	
 	
 		no it doesn't
 	
 	
 		i don't believe criminal is in a court by itself
 		and the whole judicial system is backed up with a lot of junk that shouldn't be in there
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true with all these lawsuits and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> suing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> over things ridiculous things but
 	
 	
 		we've gotten into a very litigious uh type of life
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> haven't that we though we really have but anyway i'm glad to hear that you agree with me on the  capital punishment i'm i'm very muchly for it always have been always will be
 	
 	
 		well i just
 		i just feel like their
 		crime and punishment and
 		if if you don't have the punishment
 		you double your crime and that you know that is just personal feeling it's not going on facts
 		i think the facts would probably back it up but
 	
 	
 		it could be supportive it it's it's supported with facts though
 	
 	
 		what
 	
 	
 		it could very easily be  supported with facts
 	
 	
 		well yes i
