 
     		
 	
 		okay why don't you start so you probably have a job you need to get to pretty soon
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i'm already on my job so you're you reached me at my job
 	
 	
 		oh you are
 		oh wonderful well how do you dress for work
 	
 	
 		my my dress for work uh most of the time is uh rather comfortable and casual
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh usually uh slacks and a soft colored shirt
 		the um thing that that distinguishes me a lot of the time when i have to dress real professionally for a meeting or something is i wear a clerical collar
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and a suit and uh all of that sort of thing but when i don't need to dress up for a a meeting or a service of some sort i don't
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		so you in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> there
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well i'm working this is my first <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> to work down at our little church preschool and they've told me to wear just something terribly comfortable because these are <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two year olds</TIMEX>
 		and they have a lot of uh they they have <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bible</ENAMEX> lessons and they have all the things during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX> but they still have snack time and play time so  i'm gonna be dressing just in casual slacks and T-shirts
 		probably not blue jeans but little bit short of that just just tennis shoes and play clothes
 	
 	
 		well around there you can probably wear uh T-shirts and other things but around here <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at this time of the year</TIMEX> we are into sweaters and uh coats
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i'm envious  well it's a beautiful day here and it's in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the sixties</TIMEX> but we still have a lot of hot <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoons</TIMEX> it's supposed to be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eighty five</NUMEX> today
 		so you'll still see people it's a it's kind of an in between change they're they're in their play clothes i mean they're in their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> clothes during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the afternoons</TIMEX>
 		because you just can't stand the sweaters but in the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">mornings</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are dressing for work in their sweaters because they just want it to be fall so badly
 	
 	
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today today</TIMEX> we we wear coats and as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> uh warms up we may go to light jackets but i don't think there's an escape from light jackets
 	
 	
 		
 
 		do you
 		i understand
 	
 	
 		the wind will take away a lot of body heat
 	
 	
 		well so are the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> around you um uh dressing similar to you
 	
 	
 		very similar
 	
 	
 		um-hum so you don't have a you don't have to buy the lot of the wardrobe that some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in banking and that kind of thing do
 	
 	
 		no i'm not stuck with that kind of a uh situation
 	
 	
 		well that's good
 		that's good
 	
 	
 		as i say unless it happens to be now <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> i had to dress up and and um be more formal because i had a a formal meeting at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">noon</TIMEX> time
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but then i can go home <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later in the day</TIMEX> and and be a little more casual
 	
 	
 		well that's wonderful
 	
 	
 		and then if i have a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a</NUMEX> a meeting of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that i know i can be very casual in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the evening</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		well my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> has to take the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bus</ENAMEX> into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> and doesn't return <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all day</TIMEX> so he has to dress
 		and he's just really hates that they have the long sleeve shirts and the whole tie and the whole suit
 		and even when his job is not gonna be with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all day</TIMEX> long he said it's just part of the uniform and the expected image that they have to dress
 	
 	
 		yeah that's around here in a lot of places that's the way it is i mean there there are expected expected uh dress codes
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> need to follow that i think uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX> i used to be far more uh committed to the idea of of a dress code but i've
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		relaxed a lot more as i've gotten older and become more comfortable with myself
 	
 	
 		well i think that's i think that's great i think that's good
 	
 	
 		it's taken a long time to break away from from that  but now that i've broken away from it i'm i'm glad i have
 	
 	
 		i understand
 		well another interesting thing on the our our end here is how even even in my forties how much younger i dress than my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> would have in her forties
 		and i will uh run around to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX> and things in slacks and tennis shoes  and she
 	
 	
 		you mean you don't need to wear little old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> dresses anymore
 	
 	
 		right and pearls and she would not have even probably owned a pair of tennis shoes after she got out of high school so uh she tells me i dress young but that's okay keeps me young
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that's a good idea that's a good idea
 	
 	
 		well there's not a lot more i can think of to discuss on clothing
 	
 	
 		no they're you know  what
 	
 	
 		so i i guess this is what you call a natural end
 	
 	
 		yeah what kind what kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shoes</ENAMEX> do they wear down there
 	
 	
 		well we wear uh course um like i said if  if my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>'s going downtown he's got the whole uh
 		you know the dress <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>'s dress shoes
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but for as out here just anything that the moms we all kind of have our own little dress code of just either tennis shoes or little loafers and and uh tights and things that feel comfortable to us around our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		we we can wear pretty much that although um tennis shoes are kind of out in in almost every every situation
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm sure they are there yeah i'm sure they are
 	
 	
 		unless you wanna look like a gook
 	
 	
 		that's right i'm sure that's true it's a lot different than working in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX>'s preschool that's right well you all have a nice day there
 	
 	
 		a lot different
 		you too and thank you for calling um-hum bye
 	
 	
 		thank you very much bye-bye
