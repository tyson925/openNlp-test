 		i've only been there a couple of times but the the times i was there i felt like my head was echoing  when i was trying to talk
 	
 	
 		and
 		i mean it's just i don't know it's a cavern you know it's just because it's so big and tall and and a big <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> of full of lots of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> or or what
