 		i thought that if i had a good hunting <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thumper</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> i could just go out and get all kinds of game  yeah except we live in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Plano Texas</ENAMEX> now so
 	
 	
 		did it work
 		no right i um i had a for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many years</TIMEX> i had a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> that was part <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Springer Spaniel i</ENAMEX> just love them
 		her name was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Molly</ENAMEX> but she isn't alive anymore  we had her for hm fifteen years i think my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> did and just
 		loved her she was the greatest greatest um went through <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generations</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> in my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> and was always very gentle
 	
 	
 		do you have a pet now
 	
 	
 		yeah i have a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> now he just turned <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> also  and he's i um got him in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arizona</ENAMEX>  and when i used to live there and he is huge he is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eighteen</NUMEX> pounds
 	
 	
 		oh
 		what kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> is it
 	
 	
 		just um i got him he was um he was born in the wild like in a in a shed
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and had never been in a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> when i got him so he and he's he he must be part cross part with some kind of desert animal because he's very long and lanky but he's a very tame spoiled house <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> you know now that i've had him for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven years</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		being born outside you didn't have any problems house training them
 	
 	
 		no no  he's yeah he's great and uh he's uh he's really spoiled though  so but he's
 	
 	
 		that's good
 		
 
 	
 	
 		really big so lots of times he it he seems to get in fights and when he was younger i think he started them and now i think he barely makes it i think he gets beat up even though he's big because he's
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		pretty much overweight and comes home with a few scratches now and then yeah
 	
 	
 		and older
 		well we went to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">uh cat</ENAMEX> show at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Plano Center</ENAMEX> here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> and uh we thought that we have a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> now but we thought well if we ever get another cat you know we'd want something kind of unique so
 		we kind of looked around and they had everything from hairless <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Siamese cats</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Persian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> and we sort of fell in love with the uh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maine</ENAMEX> Coon <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh i've seen them i
 	
 	
 		they're huge
 	
 	
 		yeah  i have seen them they um weren't they they were actually i can't remember they were used to be used on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX>
 		and in for  for mousers you know so they're very nautical too
 	
 	
 		oh
 		i'll be darned i didn't know that
 	
 	
 		yeah i just uh i think i'm i think i'm being accurate in the in the area of folklore but i'm not sure
 	
 	
 		well that's interesting we kind of like well my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> didn't necessarily like like them as much as i did but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manx</ENAMEX> is that the one that doesn't have a tail it sort of has a bob tail i kind of like that too but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		yeah i'd love to go to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> show i'm real like a real <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lover</ENAMEX> i'd have a lot more <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> if my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boyfriend</ENAMEX> would let us let me  he doesn't really like mine let alone another one so
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well i'll tell you an interesting story about how i got my <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> and then i suppose <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">our five minutes</TIMEX> will be up huh i uh
 	
 	
 		yeah okay
 	
 	
 		work for a university and i went to uh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Omaha Nebraska</ENAMEX> to recruit <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> and i had some time off in the afternoon so i went to a a pet shop
 		and i saw these little <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Springer Spaniels</ENAMEX> and so i decided well you know this would really be a nice <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> to have so when i got back home to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carney Nebraska</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		i told my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> about it and i said you know this is just a i i i can just hear the dog crying for me <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">now  and and Christmas</TIMEX> is coming up hint hint and so
 	
 	
 		i know what you mean
 	
 	
 		i had to go back <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next week</TIMEX> as well as a bunch of other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">university</ENAMEX> and one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> uh that we went with uh they were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> of ours and so
 		we uh got to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Omaha</ENAMEX> and i decided i'd take my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> over and show him the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> and
 		so i got over there and she said oh that's too bad the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> has already been sold and i didn't realize it but this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> had somehow worked it out so that he got there a little bit earlier bought the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> and she was in the back room
 		and uh so that <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> we had a reception for some of the uh potential high school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> or college <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> and
 		and uh he had the dog the whole time in his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> and and i had no idea and so we headed back to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carney</ENAMEX> that <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> and
 		the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> rode in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> and we stopped along the way and had a bite to eat and they left the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> and i guess while we were inside eating
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thumper</ENAMEX> just tore the heck out of the inside  of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> and uh finally we made it back to uh to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carney</ENAMEX> and
