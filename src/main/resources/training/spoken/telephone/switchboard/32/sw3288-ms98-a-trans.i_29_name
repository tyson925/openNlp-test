 
     		
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hi</ENAMEX> so uh what was the last <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> repair you had
 	
 	
 		
 
 		just recently i was kind of laughing when i when i heard the switchboard talking about the question because uh i had to have my uh radiator flushed
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and it was getting rusty and the thing that they forgot to do was to um to also look at the hose
 		and i had gone about oh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two days</TIMEX> with my new radiator flushed and the hose burst so i was stranded out on the highway
 	
 	
 		oh no did you crack the block or what
 	
 	
 		no i i i didn't do that thank goodness but um there seemed to be enough <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antifreeze</ENAMEX> in there you know left to do that but it cost me all kind of money you know to have that repaired after they said they were gonna they had repaired it t
 		so that was that was a horrible experience just recently
 	
 	
 		yeah i'll see you got lucky didn't ruin the whole engine though that can be pretty serious
 	
 	
 		yes yes i know i know what about you
 	
 	
 		oh i guess it's been awhile for me i'd say it's been about a year
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah i had the uh the water pump break on my car
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		yeah i was traveling uh i was going on my way <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thanksgiving</TIMEX> and it broke like in the middle of nowhere
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so i had to get it towed and then fixed and big pain
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh oh i know i know especially what if you're out on the highway
 	
 	
 		yeah that's where i was luckily someone came by and gave me a ride
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum i know well you know i uh living in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> you know we've got uh bumper to bumper <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> of traffic and uh that was that was horrible
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know to have the you know your <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> is fuming and everything it's already <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred</NUMEX> degrees you don't need that too oh shoot
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> is getting old see it's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about six years old</TIMEX> now so
 	
 	
 		yeah so is mine
 	
 	
 		yeah so i got it right out of college and so it's uh it's starting to show that wear and tear now
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm hoping mine gets me through i got until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX> till i'm out so if my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> lasts that long i'll be okay
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh uh</ENAMEX>-huh yeah that uh that was my graduation present to myself so yeah yeah i know so but gosh it's really starting to to wear so i've been thinking especially now is a good time to buy a car
 	
 	
 		oh that's nice
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gonna</ENAMEX> because i can't uh i don't know if i wanna you know pay all these repairs now to start getting it fixed when it's starting to breakdown
 	
 	
 		yeah i don't wanna do too much on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mine</ENAMEX> because it'll be worth more than the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> and that it it's not worth it
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum yeah that's true i agree with you there so i don't know uh because i i need to have it tuned you know tuned up and i don't know replace some of the belts and i was looking at the uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		tires need to be replaced and so i was thinking gee that's a lot of money i'm might as well buy me a new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> for that
 	
 	
 		yeah i got new tires <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last winter</TIMEX> too so i'm like that's the last major purchase for this thing it's not worth it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well you have to  <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> you have to really have your <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> winterized and stuff huh
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah we get some killer <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winters</TIMEX> up here in the mountains
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		oh really oh okay so
 	
 	
 		yeah lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">snow</ENAMEX> and a lot of cold
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well especially don't you have what a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX> on the ground
 	
 	
 		yeah at times there's a lot of it you got to like clean out the underneath of your car all the time when you get a chance
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah yeah well rust and the and the body too huh
 	
 	
 		yeah i haven't had a big problem with that though
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so i've been pretty lucky there
 	
 	
 		well i think they got the new Z <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bart</ENAMEX> stuff and everything to where you can um
 	
 	
 		yeah that's for usually pretty good you just rinse it off after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the winter</TIMEX>'s over and done with it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah and go like that so
 	
 	
 		yeah i usually like to do most repairs on my own though
 	
 	
 		do you
 	
 	
 		yeah just because that way i know what's wrong with my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> and what it needs and what it really doesn't
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah plus if something goes wrong i'll know who to blame
 	
 	
 		well i i think i'm getting too old for all that my uh i had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brothers</ENAMEX> and they used to drag me out underneath the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> and stuff so i can i can do all that stuff but i i think i'd much prefer to pay the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twenty two ninety five</NUMEX> to to go and have it done now so i can get my hands dirty
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so yeah i'm just getting getting to that age i guess you just don't have your time becomes very precious so working on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> is just not one of those things i wanna spend my time on anymore
 	
 	
 		more fun things to do
 	
 	
 		absolutely absolutely so yeah trying to you know i just need one i had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> there for a while so i wouldn't have to worry about which <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> was gonna run
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well that's nice
 	
 	
 		and yeah so but it became a hassle trying to keep up and maintain both of them and yeah so that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		one's bad enough
 	
 	
 		yes one was bad enough but i think i got rid of the wrong one  i soon i need a lot of repairs done on on this one so yeah that was uh that was something else
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		whenever <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">our five minutes</TIMEX> up  i i didn't i didn't set the time or anything to uh yeah put
 	
 	
 		yeah i was just wondering that
 		yeah i didn't either
 		yeah this must be a a hard category
 	
 	
 		well yeah i guess um you know unless you're um you know big do-it-yourselfer um to you know fix up your own <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> and
 		and things like that so but i guess they they were talking about experiences you know i uh uh i did my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> live in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX> so i i do know something about the you know the really cold weather
 		and uh i've always lived down here in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South</ENAMEX> and i went i took my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> up there to their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and um i guess i had a crack in the block and when i got up there the car
