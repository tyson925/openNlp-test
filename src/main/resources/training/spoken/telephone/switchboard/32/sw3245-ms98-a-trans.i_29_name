 		and they're all girls i have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX>  so all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> around here  yes uh really sweet
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> are nice aren't they
 		anyway as far as clothing goes um
 		my wardrobe changes all the time depending on my size  we go from regular kind of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">spring</TIMEX> clothes
 	
 	
 		that's how i am too
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		regular kind of fall clothes pregnant clothes
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 	
 	
 		clothes that are in between where you're not down to regular size yet
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		or you're on your way up from regular size  and they're all in boxes or bags and they all rotate all the time
 	
 	
 		oh that's funny
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		kind of the same stuff all the time though i don't uh get a whole lot new right now
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah  i know that's kind of how i am
 		i said who ever i talk to is going to be bored because when it's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> time i'm wearing shorts and when it's cold i'm wearing sweat pants and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		most of unless i'm going to something special that my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX>'s doing or something like that i
 	
 	
 		yeah i i like jeans a lot
 	
 	
 		well that's that's good i used to wear jeans all the time until after i had <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> and now nothing seems to be comfortable because i bulge in all the wrong places so
 	
 	
 		oh and it's it's frustrating i just i find i have to get the right kinds though or it's not comfortable
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		they it it works best if they have pleats in the front
 	
 	
 		right yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh they have to my waist is kind of small compared to the hips so it has to be not the straight up and down <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Levi</ENAMEX>'s kind
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i know what you mean well
 	
 	
 		but um but i when i was i was pregnant through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer this time</TIMEX> and i wore dresses all the time because it was so much cooler and so much more comfortable not to have something binding on your waist
 	
 	
 		oh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		right
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		but um
 	
 	
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughters</ENAMEX> was born in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June</TIMEX>
 		and i remember i wore sundresses and you know just those real cool dresses almost the entire time
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		and i had one that was born in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December</TIMEX>
 		so um it was a little bit because however it was a real warm <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> so even even into like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December</TIMEX> i was still wearing the short sleeve dresses course i'm always hot when i'm pregnant too so  i didn't really need warm clothes
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		but i really have been spoiled by sweat pants and these new uh units outfits you know that are just knit
 	
 	
 		oh i haven't tried those
 	
 	
 		oh they're so comfortable it's it's just um you know a light weight kind of like a sweat suit but made out of that real light polyester stuff and
 	
 	
 		huh
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's just great because you can put you know you can decorate them up or dress them up if you want or you can just wear them with you know tennis shoes if you want so they're really nice  and i've enjoyed wearing those
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but i
 	
 	
 		i don't know if they expected us to talk about blazers and such here but i sure never wear them
 	
 	
 		yeah well i don't either if we if we had professional jobs where we go into an office and have to wear a jacket or something that would make a big difference
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i worked part time when my oldest was a baby
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and um i had to wear a dress <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX> and
 	
 	
 		i'm watching <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Janice  uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh it was a little bit hard to uh
 		wind down i would i would have to drive <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six thirty five</TIMEX> home and i would be burning up like in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX> time by the time i got home i was like oh i got to get out of these clothes
 	
 	
 		oh
 		i i remember that from when i was i worked way before i was
 		married  even but uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> they keep them so cold in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX> that you can't wear regular <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> clothes and be comfortable
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		right right
 	
 	
 		you've got to have something to add to it or something i don't know if you can
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		yeah and then when you drive home like especially if you're in a lot of traffic which you are in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> uh-huh because i always hated to run my air conditioner just sitting still all the time i was afraid i'd make the car overheat
 	
 	
 		you burn up yeah
 		yeah
 		it's hard on the car
 	
 	
 		yeah so i would roll my windows down it was still a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">hundred degrees</NUMEX>  and i would just be sweltering hot by the time i picked my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> up and
 	
 	
 		oh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um i had a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> who used to take shorts to work and after work she'd go in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bathroom</ENAMEX>  and change her clothes and i thought that's probably a good idea
 	
 	
 		oh that's funny
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		because you really it
 	
 	
 		at least something cooler
 	
 	
 		yeah because you can ruin your good clothes getting so hot in them if you
 	
 	
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		especially if it's something that has to be dry cleaned which i don't have any of
 	
 	
 		yeah i don't have to worry a whole lot about that
 	
 	
 		no when you have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> you don't um even when i go to church i have to have something i can just throw in the washer when i'm through
 	
 	
 		that's right something that it doesn't matter if it gets spit up on too
 	
 	
 		that's right or if you get it dirty or whatever i know it
 	
 	
 		i've always been a creature of comfort too if it's not comfortable forget it
 	
 	
 		me too
 		i know that's how i am too
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">wool</ENAMEX> was never comfortable to me
 	
 	
 		right me neither i have
