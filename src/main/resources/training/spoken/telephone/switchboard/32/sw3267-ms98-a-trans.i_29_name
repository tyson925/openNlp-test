 		primarily with our local newspaper and TV
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i listen to the radio but not um
 		not like i did when i was working i am recently  retired to that means i have a lot of time to watch the news on TV how do you gain your news
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i guess the i get the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> and that is  pretty big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX> and i think that's
 		almost exclusive my exclusively my <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of the news though i have the radio on when i go to work i don't think the news
 		usually hits  because i'm not going right on the hour
 	
 	
 		oh i see well that's that is one of the handicaps with both TV and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and radio if you're not available on <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the hour or half hour</TIMEX> then you lose out on an awful lot well what is your newspaper
 		that is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> is that correct i have read that when we were in that area and it it's a splendid newspaper
 	
 	
 		right
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so what more do we need to discuss <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">tonight</TIMEX> that seems like a very short one
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right i think that you know we've we've resolved the issue and that's what we were asked to do
 	
 	
 		
  
 		well i can discuss a lot of the news that we have but um i feel that that's not part of our responsibility
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 	
 	
 		so thank you for calling
