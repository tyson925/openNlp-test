 		um-hum how was that
 	
 	
 		that was that was pretty good that was enjoyable
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i i didn't think it was quite as good as the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> one
 	
 	
 		yeah my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> my teenage <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> liked it so i wasn't quite sure how to take that whether i would whether i would like it our not
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		it was it was pretty clever
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and then we saw
 		the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> that was the kind of the spoof of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Top Gun</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		there was they were kind of along the same lines but i i didn't enjoy that one near as much i didn't it wasn't as well done i don't think
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but uh and i'm trying to remember we've seen some other goods ones but uh and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">and then Silence</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lambs</ENAMEX> that one kept me thinking for a month
 	
 	
 		yeah that was uh almost to uh
 		to spine tingling for me i  i liked it but it was uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah it was
 	
 	
 		it was interesting because the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> i thought that that really you know stole the show was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anthony Hopkins</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and he was so good in that
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah he definitely he definitely did i saw him in uh did you see him when he played uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adolf Hitler</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		no i didn't
 	
 	
 		oh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> that was uh
 		he also i mean he he was outstanding act too
 	
 	
 		yeah it's it's amazing how because i mean realistically he wasn't in that movie but you know <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty minutes</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and yet you know he just captivated
 	
 	
 		yeap
 	
 	
 		it it was amazing it really was
 	
 	
 		yeah you're right uh you don't think uh he was so dominating dominating you don't think about it but he was on screen not any where near as long as
 	
 	
 		right i it know but he is the one that kept you thinking throughout the whole movie
 	
 	
 		yep yep
 	
 	
 		and uh that that was that was really a good movie i really enjoyed that one
 	
 	
 		yep how did you like <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Dances With Wolves</ENAMEX> did you like that one
 	
 	
 		uh we haven't seen that one yet yeah i i haven't mustered up enough strength to go sit through <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a three hour</TIMEX> movie
 	
 	
 		oh you haven't
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so i i
 		i run out of patience on a movie like that i start checking my watch <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about an hour and half</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		is that right yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah  hm
 	
 	
 		well it kept me uh i it kept me uh interested the whole time yeah
 	
 	
 		really i've heard i've heard it's really good i haven't gone to see it probably be out on tape before long too
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah it's out
 		yeah yeah we didn't see it at the theater we waited till it came out too
 	
 	
 		is it
 		oh
 		oh i see
 	
 	
 		how about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robin Hood</ENAMEX> have you seen that one me neither
 	
 	
 		no
 		me neither
 	
 	
 		um i really want to see that one it's and it about to come out in on uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kevin Costner</ENAMEX> yeah the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kevin Costner</ENAMEX> movie is that what you are talking about yeah um uh i really like him i have somehow that movie never grabbed me you know as one that i would like to see but uh
 	
 	
 		on
 		huh
 		yeah yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		it did it uh well really interested me until the reviews started coming out and they were sort of um
 	
 	
 		did they pan it pretty bad or
 	
 	
 		no they it it um they said uh that he was
 		um he's he's performance was only average
 		and um
 		and and i read i read some interviews with him that he was the production was rushed so much that he didn't he evidently he studies his uh his parts real in depth
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh at least that's what the article said and it was rushing the production he and he he was in intention to master a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> accent for it and didn't have time to do that
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		and then they said there were some wholes in the story line too
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		something i saw on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Showtime</ENAMEX> or something <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the other night</TIMEX> the i hadn't hadn't seen in a while was uh was The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hunt</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Red</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX> did you see that
 	
 	
 		yeah i like that one i've seen i've seen that i saw it about i saw it once and i've seen it <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about four</NUMEX> times on cable
 	
 	
 		yeah me too i'm the same way and that that's really an intriguing movie too
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah that's a good one
 	
 	
 		there there are several like that uh another one i saw that me and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> really talked about after it was over was uh Sex Lies and Videotape
 	
 	
 		oh yeah no i've only seen uh like uh
 	
 	
 		did you see that
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bits</ENAMEX> and pieces of it
 	
 	
 		yeah i was traveling and and you know it was in the hotel and i and i saw little bits and pieces of it was that was that was that any good or was it just exploit
 	
 	
 		it wasn't bad the thing was you know it was interesting the way the their lives intertwined and and and then at the end they kind of all fell apart and you know there are a lot of things to talk about after that you know because it was real interesting
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		the interpersonal relationship and stuff
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so it it was a movie that we you know we end up when when you first leave there it's like you know i don't know if i like that movie but then as we get to talk about it its like all these different things that deal with these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> or whatever
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		so it wasn't an exploitation film uh
 	
 	
 		no not not at all  if that's what is sounds like
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but it's not that at all uh it just it talks about
 		it it's basically only got <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in the whole movie and uh you know the whole the whole thing just revolves around them and you know uh really i mean
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
