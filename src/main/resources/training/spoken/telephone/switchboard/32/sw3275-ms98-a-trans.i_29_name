 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		so do you have an opinion on credit cards
 	
 	
 		um i do
 	
 	
 		you do
 	
 	
 		what do what do you think about them
 	
 	
 		i think they get a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in trouble
 	
 	
 		yeah definitely i have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> right now and
 		um i just got it <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about eight six months ago</TIMEX> and i find that it it makes it a lot easier to get things that you generally wouldn't get
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah and then you don't stop to realize that you know you charge this for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty</TIMEX> charge that for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty</TIMEX> charge this for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty</TIMEX> and pretty soon you owe a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">hundred dollars</NUMEX> and you don't stop to think about it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i got in trouble when i was in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">service</ENAMEX> quite <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few years ago</TIMEX> like <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">fifteen thousand dollars</NUMEX> in trouble
 	
 	
 		oh my goodness
 	
 	
 		and then you know so i eventually got it all paid now i carry one i have a gas card and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Visa</ENAMEX> card and i never use them unless i need to
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		that's good yeah yeah i'd i made a rule with myself when i got <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> that if i couldn't pay it in full <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every month</TIMEX> that i'd have to rip it up so
 	
 	
 		but they
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		that's a good idea
 	
 	
 		that's
 	
 	
 		stops all them interest rates and interest rates aren't
 		none too shallow <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these days</TIMEX> anyway
 	
 	
 		yeah that
 	
 	
 		but i know a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that get in trouble with them especially you know we have i'm in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lubbock</ENAMEX> and we have a bunch of college <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> around here going to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tech</ENAMEX>
 		and they seem to get in trouble with them a lot
 	
 	
 		um-hum i have i have a couple <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> too that have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about three</NUMEX> of them maxed out  and they they can't do anything but work to try to pay them off and and and like one of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		she has hers is up to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">nine hundred dollars</NUMEX> and she does she only earns like <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">two hundred dollars</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a month</TIMEX> because she's going to school
 	
 	
 		jeez
 	
 	
 		and and so i mean that's just enough to pay rent and buy like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">five dollars</NUMEX> worth of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> a month so and and pay for her like
 		like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</TIMEX> fee like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty</TIMEX> yeah you have i guess you have to pay like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty</TIMEX> dollars <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each month</TIMEX> is the so all she's paying is interest on hers every month
 	
 	
 		yeah something like that
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it just seems crazy to
 		to me but
 	
 	
 		well my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> got in trouble one time with hers and
 		she was making like
 		i don't know what she was making <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">forty five dollars</NUMEX> a month i think
 		and fifteen dollars of it was because she was over the limit and fifteen dollars of it was interest so she was only paying in it fifteen <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">dollars</NUMEX> a month
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so and that was before we got married so
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but it's you know we sat down and talked about it and discussed it and it's
 		it's come out pretty good now we have a
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eighteen year old</TIMEX> that's fixing to get out of high school and go to college and
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		that's the first thing he wanted
 	
 	
 		was it <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Visa</ENAMEX> card
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		oh my goodness
 	
 	
 		so we kind of discussed that a little bit and shot that idea down right quick
 	
 	
 		i bet
 	
 	
 		you know so
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm i don't know i'm about <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sick</ENAMEX> of mine right now
 		i don't
 	
 	
 		but i think they're too readily accessible and there's too many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> out there that are willing to give them to you and get you draft get you trapped i mean you can always file bankruptcy to get out of it but that's a lot of pain and hassle when
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the olden days</TIMEX> when my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> were growing up and uh
 		we couldn't afford everything we didn't have such things as credit cards we just waited till time come around that we could afford it and you know we had all the necessities so
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and i very seldom use a credit card on necessities i always use it for something i want not something i need
 	
 	
 		exactly yeah my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> are really good about
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		not using credit cards they are against it  i don't think they like the fact that i have one either
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i think if credit cards were as as stringent as say a a home mortgage loan or something like that where you have to you know be able to prove that you can afford this and the rest of your bills we probably wouldn't have the problems we have
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		course we wouldn't have the retail market we have either so i guess they'd trade one for the other
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i disagree with it but they still trade one for the other
 	
 	
 		
 
 		hm
 	
 	
 		well that's good i'm it sounds like you kind of got your head together in the credit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> for you sound pretty young so
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm nineteen i'm <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty right now</TIMEX> so just going to school and
 	
 	
 		are you yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and working so
 	
 	
 		all right
 	
 	
 		it does kind of get in when you want something that like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last weekend</TIMEX> was homecoming and i needed a pair of shoes so i just went out and bought them and  on my credit card i didn't didn't have the money to do it
