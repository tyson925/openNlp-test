 
     		
 	
 		all right <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amy</ENAMEX> how are you doing today
 	
 	
 		fine fine
 	
 	
 		oh all righty i think we know what we're going to speak about um tell you what i'll start off how's that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		okay you go ahead
 	
 	
 		um i personally think to set a mark with the judicial system and we're talking about <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">criminals</ENAMEX> criminal cases that they should bring back
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 		hangings on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekends</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		in public places
 	
 	
 		in public <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">places</ENAMEX> there is one state that does that by the way
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		really what is that
 	
 	
 		i want to say <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oklahoma</ENAMEX> i saw report something <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the other night</TIMEX> about it
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		they don't do them real often which is obviously the death penalty
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um but i think if we quit uh building these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Taj Mahals</ENAMEX> with the color TVs
 		and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixty</TIMEX> dollars <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixty thousand a year</TIMEX> to keep an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inmate</ENAMEX> in there on a on a on a life sentence we should start hanging them and get it over with and let's just screwing up the system uh
 	
 	
 		yeah well the sentences are so unbelievable i just saw on the news last night that they said the average time a sentenced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">murderer</ENAMEX> you know is in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">jail</ENAMEX> is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</TIMEX> before he's paroled and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rapists</ENAMEX> is like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six months</TIMEX> and a burglar is like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two months</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		that's pathetic
 		that's pathetic it's
 	
 	
 		because they just say there's either no <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> in the system you know in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">jails</ENAMEX> for them or
 		you know it's just that it seems like the automatic sentences if if a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> has leeway on what he's going to you know sentence someone for between you know <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two months</TIMEX> and uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fifty years</TIMEX> and you know what's his whim to decide it should be <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two months</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		this is true and <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">and and and</ENAMEX> and the way the law reads uh if they sentence you to
 	
 	
 		you know it's crazy
 	
 	
 		life in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prison</ENAMEX> then he's available for parole if it's if it's life and a day then he's not eligible for parole so what you know let's quit BSing with the system
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well even if it's life like you say we end up spending <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixty</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">thousand dollars</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> to keep some you know joker in there for life we could spend that money you know for starving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> that are starving or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twelve million</NUMEX> other things would be more useful than that
 	
 	
 		exactly
 	
 	
 		so to me if somebody has life you know beyond a reasonable doubt they should that should be it you know particularly for some of these really
 	
 	
 		a life for a life
 	
 	
 		i mean there are so many just major major serial murders and it's not just like one instance or something it's just uh horrifying some of the murders that go on
 	
 	
 		the old <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Manson</ENAMEX> case i mean the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> is really
 	
 	
 		yeah and the yeah there's just everyday you hear on the news of another one like that um
 	
 	
 		
 
 		just shouldn't be allowed to to even even live uh about the issue about sentencing by the judge
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		the the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> presently has an opportunity to intervene
 		uh when there's uh my understanding when there's uh a verdict and it for example there's a hung <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jury</ENAMEX> here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fort Worth</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two day</TIMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight to four</NUMEX> and bam bam the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> got off
 		uh he was uh he he was a veterinarian and killed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> okay
 	
 	
 		right yeah i heard about that on the news yeah
 	
 	
 		um kind of gets back to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> request we've been asked to look at is most criminal cases requiring an ananimous verdict the a situation like that i'd say no let's just go like a regular vote <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight to four</NUMEX> tells me that there were eight
 		there's a percentage certain percentage of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> there with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">sixty percent</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> uh seventy percent of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> said hey
 	
 	
 		right rather than have to retrial the whole whole thing and spend all the money for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to you know go back to court and all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> and i mean it just winds up costing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">taxpayers</ENAMEX> a fortune you know a fortune to keep doing that
 	
 	
 		the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX>'s guilty
 		exactly
 	
 	
 		and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> you know the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that have been murdered they just have to have it dragged on for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> before they ever get any resolution
 	
 	
 		exactly because it's not <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next day</TIMEX> they have the start the trial which is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">X</NUMEX> number of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> and just prolongs the situation that much more
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		i think that that if it's if it's not a split decision uh go with the highest number and let's just get on with the program
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		uh but as far as the sentencing by the judge i would have to vote against that since there's a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jury</ENAMEX> because that's what the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">juries</ENAMEX> are for is to make the decision um what are your feelings
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		well if i i saw on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the talk shows this woman <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> i believe from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> and she just has just really stiff penalties and i saw that in in the hands of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> that really was conscientious and really
 		you know took the pains to give a sentence for what was deserved it could you could have a a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> that would really make a good impact but likewise you could have the flip side
 		and have some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> that was paid off or you know had good a good old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> network or for whatever reasons you know politics just let all kinds of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> through so he he would have a heck or she would have a heck of a lot of power
 		you know if used wrongly so at least the jury system does something to prevent that you know or help it with it anyway i don't know if it prevents it but  seems like the jury system does have it's advantages
 		but i also i've also heard on trials that sometimes they go through like <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three hundred</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">jurors</ENAMEX> before they hand pick these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">jurors</ENAMEX> that they think are going to be the ones that are going to be the most lenient you know
 		and i don't know how much they're getting just a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jury</ENAMEX> of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peers</ENAMEX> at that point they're really getting a select group it's not just random people
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		it almost should be the first twelve <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that they you know that have on a list are the ones that are on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jury</ENAMEX> and that's it
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i get back to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Price</ENAMEX>'s comment when he uh was found guilty he said well he didn't have any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> uh you know from his neck of the woods well give me a break you know
 	
 	
 		you know
 		
 
 		he'd have to have his whole family up there for him to feel like he's got his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peers</ENAMEX> or something yeah
 	
 	
 		exactly
 		yeah yeah i mean you're you're in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> so everybody i can't believe they can uh like in a murder situations they look for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">juries</ENAMEX> who don't know anything about the system well or know anything about the the occurrence you'd have to be pretty dense
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you'd be in have to be in a cave not to know what's going on or moving it to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lubbock</ENAMEX> or somewhere possibly is not the answer
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh they'd have to move it to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> not to know about it practically
 	
 	
 		this is true so true well this has been an interesting conversation
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		well really this is breaks up my <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> from changing diapers and mopping floors i mean what can i say no i'm at home with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> preschoolers  my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> works for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX>
