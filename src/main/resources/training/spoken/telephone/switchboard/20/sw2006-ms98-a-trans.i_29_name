 
     		
 	
 		
 
 		alrighty uh i guess our topic today is air pollution and we are to just discuss what substances do you think contribute most to air pollution
 		as well as what society can do to improve the air quality of the atmosphere around us
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		um
 		
 
 		does your work entitle uh anything in environmental along these lines
 	
 	
 		me i'm in the legal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> and um we do have uh a group of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> who handle our environmental issues
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i don't know too much about the air pollution thing i do know for other types of uh pollution like the toxic waste and such that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> has to dispose of the we normally put in the ground you know we're coming up with a
 		a new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solution</ENAMEX> we have been finding a lot of toxic places to dump and we just transport to these places but after while it always seems that the um oh the site starts to leak and then you have to clean it up and such
 		but the new idea is to take everything up to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sherman</ENAMEX> and we're gonna have that you know incineration place up there and dump everything there and supposedly that <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> will not generate air pollutants
 	
 	
 		very
 	
 	
 		from what i've heard that everything would be in in you know a confined kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">incinerator</ENAMEX> and just burn it all up and that we won't be polluting the air i'm sure we have to have
 		uh permits you know for that place and that there's you know limits as to what we can uh let you know go into the air
 	
 	
 		yeah it's uh having uh uh well well i work in too i work in environmentals uh projects right now and so the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sherman</ENAMEX> deal is uh uh uh
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		lost a lot of hair over that project uh what we run into um is we have the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texas Air Control Board</ENAMEX> TACB that send out uh jurisdictions under which we have to uh uh reply to
 	
 	
 		oh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and a lot of their rules and regulations aren't real clear so we have our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> of environmental who assist the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TACB</ENAMEX> which is located in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Austin</ENAMEX> in writing and hey look what we've done here at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TI</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh we are presently uh in receipt of a site permit which will allow us to um
 		uh this is air side allow allow to have certain emissions up to a certain tonnage it's in in in <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">tons</NUMEX> per year um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		okay
 	
 	
 		and so what what you know what we do to make contributions so that basically we go and do things like put in uh high-tech scrubber systems
 		uh that uh scrub out the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOX</ENAMEX> and uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VOCs</ENAMEX> and and the ammonia compounds uh like all the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>
 		uh to a certain level we are very um uh aware of the opacity which is the thickness of a stack emissions so if you don't see anything coming out of a stack the opacity is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty</TIMEX> or there abouts
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and so what we go through is uh if you see it smoking there's a problem and having worked with some of the legal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX> very closely uh it becomes a real issue especially when it's smoking and you have to get it fixed el pronto
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		as you know the they're allowed to come on site the federaldes anytime they want drive through and see and inspect so it's a full time uh everybody has your home phone number type of job uh
 	
 	
 		hm
 		now is that <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">place</ENAMEX> built or you're still in the makings of it
 	
 	
 		the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sherman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> we are still in the
 		closer to but still have a little bit of um finalization to do right it's been pitched to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sherman</ENAMEX> uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">City Council</ENAMEX> with uh open arms as well as the public we had open <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">forum</ENAMEX> and and uh
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">uh Tom Jones</ENAMEX> our environmental corporate environmental <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX>'s handling the project
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh it's real uh going real well i think it's matter just a matter of fund the funds <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">right now</TIMEX> as i understand it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh but it's uh it's something else yeah that they're in the same issue we were uh hoping on burning a lot of the effluent up there uh
 		because the the system is setup where it won't have any emissions uh you're correct it will have something coming out of the stack obviously just because human nature but it won't have uh any uh
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		any bad stuff so uh i think <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> we spend of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">of</NUMEX> of all the major semiconductor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX> we probably put safety and environmental on the utmost foremost uh
 		uh first thing we always look at and we probably put more money into the systems and engineering behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">systems</ENAMEX> than any other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX> i know of we eat and sleep the stuff everything we do over here and uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it's an interesting job but um
 	
 	
 		well i know from some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> that we've had done quite a list of sites that have gone bad and you have to clean up and
 		you know the law now is a super <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">fund</ENAMEX> and anybody who's contributed toxic waste no matter if you were somebody that eventually you know uh damaged the ground or not
 		uh everybody has to contribute and it's been a lot of big bucks when we've uh gotten pulled into these uh super <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">fund</ENAMEX> deals to clean it up that's you know mega bucks to uh
 		you know take everything out and redo it and you know fill in some other area and um
 		certainly it would seem to have a better solution like the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sherman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> than um just letting it go in the ground because eventually you know it it seems that no matter what they do if they put it in oil drums and then seal it in some kind of cement lined uh dump area
 		it still only in time starts to leak out
 	
 	
 		possibly
 	
 	
 		yeah there there was one site that they cleaned up and then the new place leaked again
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		jeez
 	
 	
 		uh i'm familiar with that one
 		we uh we have stuff that's very interesting yeah
 		we have hoods we have ductwork and all those type of uh interesting pieces of equipment where they have uh that we sample and it may have uh over uh a certain emission levels this is on the solid side and so we take it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh we can't deep well inject something like that because it's a solid and we mix it with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">concrete</ENAMEX> and actually um potash per se and and concrete and then actually put it in the ground
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but not so not in a hazardous waste location because it's basically a concrete slab
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		which is totally legal but the cost of doing this is astronomical they actually shave up ductwork and things and so we're uh very very uh cognizitive and aware of all these type of uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		expenditures because it can get very expensive but i think we you know we do all kinds of things to make the the the world a better place to live and i think some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX> that aren't aware of it will be surprised at how much effort and energy is put into doing that i really would
 		um
 		
 
 		i've enjoyed speaking with you
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		this has been an interesting topic uh i was one of the i was responsible for all the planning and engineering of the corporate area in the north building  yeah
 	
 	
 		oh you were oh okay
 	
 	
 		so uh i hope you like your office
 	
 	
 		yes
 		yes it's a heck of a lot different i mean we we used to be really embarrassed about the gray metal desk we were about the only place in you know <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> that had the gray metal desk <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> used to come and laugh and go gee i hadn't seen one of those in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten fifteen years</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah glad to see y'all taken care of well the i think what changed everything and uh is uh y'all were y'all the only ones that make any money for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> here in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last two years</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		we finally got a little respect nobody thought of us as a profit <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> before
 	
 	
 		
 
 		so
 		exactly and that's um when you start making when you start paying your wages you know <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerry</ENAMEX> takes a different outlook towards you guys
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right right not just overhead
 	
 	
 		i've enjoyed exactly i've enjoyed speaking with you see you later bye-bye
 	
 	
 		you too bye
