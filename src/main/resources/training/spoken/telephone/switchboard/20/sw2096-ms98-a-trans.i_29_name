 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		do you feel that uh drug testing is necessary at the workplace
 	
 	
 		um i have mixed feelings about it um i don't particularly care for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who take <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> and uh it's a possibility of having accidents in the workplace but um i also feel like it's an invasion of privacy
 	
 	
 		yeah i have some basic concerns about it as well uh not just the invasion of privacy but the the chance of uh false positive being being reported
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right right
 	
 	
 		uh i have been drug tested in the past and it's not really a pleasant experience at work
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh it gives you the uh impression  the uh impression that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> really doesn't trust the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that work for them
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and you're pretty much uh assumed to be guilty until proven innocent by the test results
 	
 	
 		right yeah yeah i have a lot of problems with it um i um i have been tested also several times and uh in fact it has always come up negative i mean but that's no problem with it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		coming up negative but i do take prescription drugs and i'm always been afraid that those were going to come up and show something on any of the tests
 	
 	
 		yeah well they make uh allowances for that if you report that at the time that you take the test
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but there's always a chance that you forget and have to justify it later
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right
 	
 	
 		or if the prescription say ran out or if you're using something that's uh older than older than the date uh on the package or whatever
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		right right yeah but i agree with you though they uh they're trying to uh you know they're they're saying that you are guilty until proven innocent and uh and i don't really appreciate that at all
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah if they do come up with a positive regardless of what uh what it was they detected
 		uh we're required to go attend a uh a counseling session
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh that gets put in your permanent uh files on your record
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		it's just not not a real good uh thing to have on your uh employment uh records
 	
 	
 		no no because this can follow you um at other places too
 		i was reading uh <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this morning</TIMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX> where it was talking about um  they have <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> or or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> out now who will go and do background searches on uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> before they ever hire them
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		and if you get one of those false negative reportings and and you're fired from your job that's going to carryover into other jobs um no matter um you know if it's truth or not so yeah it can stick with you for a long time
 	
 	
 		yeah uh according to uh to the way that that our test is set up apparently everyone is supposed to be tested <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">within a five year</TIMEX> period
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and uh they they do it on a random basis i'm not sure how they can guarantee that everybody is going to be tested within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five years</TIMEX> if it really is random
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so i'm not sure exactly what they base that on
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well uh cause you work for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> also right yeah because uh i think what they say what they would uh take your name out of the hopper
 	
 	
 		yeah um-hum sure
 	
 	
 		so that whatever is left in the hopper you know it's it's um uh that's when you'd be tested and then when you were tested then it'd be taken out of there so that's that's how they said they would uh do it over a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five year</TIMEX> period
 	
 	
 		okay
 		well i'm not sure exactly if that's true though because i know <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that have been tested <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> time
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and many have not been tested yet
 	
 	
 		um well it's only been what <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year two years</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">couple of years</TIMEX> yeah
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum yeah it hadn't been i know i was called up right away  it didn't no i was called up let's see yeah we started testing in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January</TIMEX> and i was called up right away in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		okay  it took them awhile to find me
 		oh no well they they did all the all the top level managers
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh at first
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh everybody else uh gets to take their turn
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		so they called me in uh just <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few months</TIMEX> ago
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah but yeah you're right that wasn't a very pleasant experience
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		especially i felt like there was a camera watching
 	
 	
 		oh no  i never thought about that i i had some questions for the for the the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurse</ENAMEX> who was uh conducting the test in the health center though
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		asked her if she enjoyed her job
 	
 	
 		what'd she say
 	
 	
 		
 
 		she thought it was different you get to meet a lot of people
 	
 	
 		yeah on a continuing basis too
 	
 	
 		so i try i try to introduce some levity there
 	
 	
 		you know that was uh that was a really interesting because it was a great big <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bathroom</ENAMEX> it was it was a great big <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> and uh and i remember the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the vents</TIMEX> you know just right over the top of the toilet
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and and i just just knew i was being photographed you know i just  i'm glad i don't have to go through that experience again
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		yeah well there are a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who express uh much stronger feelings about it than i have
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and in fact i know some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that uh probably will quit before being tested even though there's nothing to uh to worry about as far as i know from the test results just a matter of principle
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		well um i guess growing up in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the sixties</TIMEX> and uh i don't know that particular era and generation i think about it though whether i have some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> who are occasional uh marijuana <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">smokers</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		you know it's just a hangover i guess from uh from that particular generation
 		and uh but yeah they're they're just adamant that they're not going to be you know tested and they're going to fight it and um you know try and um see what they can do that it's an invasion of privacy
 		but i don't particularly care to uh you know to uh to get into <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> or anything else so it's not a problem for me but i uh i can kind of understand from the other point of view
 	
 	
 		yeah well i know some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that i <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">suspect</ENAMEX> are casual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> of uh marijuana as well and i expect that they probably uh mended their ways uh in uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		in response to this uh drug testing that they no longer uh even use anything like that on a casual basis
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		because it is a matter of of losing your job if you get caught say a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> time
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and even the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time uh for these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are uh oh well on their way in on on the technical ladder or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> and they're jeopardizing their positions
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 		oh yeah yeah i i could really see t hat uh so yeah they'll just have to find other means of uh relaxing and
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		but the one thing too that that i have a problem with is that well if marijuana and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocaine</ENAMEX> and the other those so-called uh illegal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> you know what about alcohol
 	
 	
 		well some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> have gone that far <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh TI</ENAMEX> has not
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but others have and they're setting themselves up for uh more lawsuits i think than uh
 	
 	
 		i think so yeah yeah but you know  alcohol destroys you know so many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> so now
 	
 	
 		than we are
 	
 	
 		so that's that's what i thought was interesting that uh there are still <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> out there and then there are those socially acceptable drugs
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right i don't mind so much the fact that they test <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> but uh not questioning the validity of the results is is a problem because uh
 	
 	
 		you know
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh
 		i i i fully expect that that any test results that comeback for me would be negative that in in the event that one would be positive there's no recourse other than get yourself a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> or go to this counseling session and admit guilt uh they won't accept anything else
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		oh yeah yeah yeah because you'd be strongly into denial  it's just like well we know you take it we've got the positive test results and you're going i don't i don't
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah well if if you turn down the counseling they they will fire you
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		that's uh condition of employment
 	
 	
 		right
 		right yeah i think there's some flaws in it i i think their main objective is is good you know to make sure they have a drug free workplace but i do think that there are a lot of flaws in there
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		and i understand that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> will not use that particular drug testing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> that that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> is using
 	
 	
 		is that right
 	
 	
 		um  yeah because they're not as reliable as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> wants them to be
 	
 	
 		i thought that's the only one that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> does use so
 	
 	
 		oh well i heard just the opposite
 	
 	
 		i'm not sure
 	
 	
 		so i don't know it could just be rumors that spread around you know when they
 	
 	
 		okay yeah there aren't just too many places uh that do testing like that where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> uh uh gives well
 		gives them full reign uh trust the results because they have to prove on a continual basis that uh that they are meeting um their standards for false positives and whatnot
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 		right
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		they claim uh zero false positives ever and i find that very hard to believe
 	
 	
 		oh
 		yeah that that to me yeah it'd be very hard to believe too
 	
 	
 		okay well uh hum
 	
 	
 		is <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">our five minutes</TIMEX> up  okay well it was nice talking to you okay bye
 	
 	
 		i think yeah i'm sure it is i think that about covers what we want to talk about
 		i enjoyed it okay sure bye
