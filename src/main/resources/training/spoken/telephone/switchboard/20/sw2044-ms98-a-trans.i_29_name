 
     		
 	
 		i guess we're um uh we're we're experiencing uh what to me i guess is a surprisingly mild uh winter
 		uh  we've had a lot more warm weather than usual and we haven't had any ice storms uh usually we have at least one
 		um course i've only lived here <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three years</TIMEX> but uh but that in still in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that three years</TIMEX> you could always count on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">ice</ENAMEX> storm
 	
 	
 		my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>'s been in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> during an ice storm he said that he pulled up to a stop at a stop sign and completely stopped just slid to the side of the curb that they're that bad <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lubbock</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		we get ice storms but not not quite to that extent it's not the thin sheet you know all across the road ours if it ices over it's thick it's with snow it's something that you can drive on you can get a little traction with
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh i think we've been fortunate that we've missed
 		any of the real bad weather <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> because we went to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> instead  but right now
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		um we're having unusually warm weather it's it's almost like they're trying it's trying to skip <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">spring</TIMEX> and go straight to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> it's either
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh thirty degrees you know <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ninety</NUMEX> the next and and we're missing the fifties and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixties</TIMEX> in there somewhere
 	
 	
 		right that's right it's it's the same way here how long have you lived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lubbock</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		well i have been here permanently or full time since <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nineteen eighty</ENAMEX> and uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		pretty much off and on since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seventy four so</TIMEX> really quite a while and i've watched the weather shift you know i can remember being here back in the seventies in college and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the spring</TIMEX> dust storms were
 	
 	
 		wow yeah
 	
 	
 		uh they were massive i mean you could stand on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> and not see <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> across the street
 	
 	
 		dust storms whoa  yeah
 	
 	
 		that dust yeah  not fun to be in but i haven't seen any like that in probably <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five or ten years</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		so it's it's changing and the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summers</TIMEX> are getting hot and the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winters</TIMEX> are cold but
 		i guess i can live with it
 	
 	
 		well i know when we first moved here it was uh it was at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the very beginning of the year</TIMEX> nineteen <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eighty seven</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh we when we left we moved from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Hampshire</ENAMEX> where it was snowing
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and we got here and we just couldn't believe how warm it was i mean it was in the fifties and we were taking off our <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> coats and we were all dressed like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eskimos</ENAMEX> and uh and then soon after we had this big <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> storm
 		uh where everything was just covered with like <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">an inch</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> and everybody uh and it was obvious that nobody knew how to drive in this weather
 	
 	
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		and uh we were feeling very cocky because course we always in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Hampshire</ENAMEX> you always have that kind of weather but um
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> and i just i just assumed that was the way it was you know you didn't get snow which was nice because you didn't have to shovel it
 		and but you always you could expect to have this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> storm and i think there was in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the three years</TIMEX> we've been here there's been <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> other <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">ice</ENAMEX> storm
 		um you <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the second year</TIMEX> we had an ice storm and i was really surprised that uh that we didn't have anything like that this year
 	
 	
 		well now does <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> get <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">snow</ENAMEX> or is it usually just the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">ice</ENAMEX> storm
 	
 	
 		it it uh well it if you get any snow it's barely enough to hide the brown grass
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		you know and uh certainly nothing that you have to do anything about um
 	
 	
 		well that was one reason why i figured that i could stand <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lubbock Texas</ENAMEX> that was about as much <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> as i could get because i grew up <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">west</ENAMEX> coast sunshine green leaves on trees
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		came back here and could not realize why i'd been so depressed through the winter
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and realized that that was the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time in my life i had seen <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> lose their <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">leaves</ENAMEX> and uh and course when <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">spring</TIMEX> and everything came out again
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		uh it was beautiful but that's about as much <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> as i can take i mean it gets <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cold</ENAMEX> here and with wind chill it sometimes gets you know <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">fifteen twenty degrees</NUMEX> below because of the wind
 	
 	
 		sure
 		
 
 		right yeah
 	
 	
 		but it's not <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">six feet</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">snow</ENAMEX> and it doesn't stay on the ground <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six months</TIMEX> out of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> and i know the sun is coming
 	
 	
 		right
 		well that's the thing uh with us too it's uh just we just
 		you know in up in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New England</ENAMEX> you had more <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> than you had a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer summer</TIMEX> and uh you could expect <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a long winter</TIMEX> period uh for instance um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		we could you could uh in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New England</ENAMEX> it would still be cold i mean ice cold snow kind of weather uh now in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX> it just in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX> is is just when things
 		start uh approaching the fifty degree mark and course we've already had eighty degree weather here and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day day</TIMEX> before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> it got <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to eighty eight</NUMEX> i think
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">now</TIMEX> when did <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> start there you said you had more <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> than <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">summer</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> would start oh yeah <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> would start uh in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September</TIMEX> it would start getting cold in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		now was there actually snow on the ground all that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that time</TIMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September</TIMEX> through what <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">March</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		there could be yeah there could be and and it came i mean i used to i used to work in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX> which was <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an hour and a half</TIMEX> away
 	
 	
 		oh goodness
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i would get up at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five o'clock in the morning</TIMEX> just to shovel out driveway
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and that's so i could leave by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and uh so i would sometimes take me you know <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an hour</TIMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> to shovel the driveway in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX> and then i'd sitting in that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an hour an a half</TIMEX>
 		and and well it was actually if the if the weather was bad enough to shovel snow it would take me <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three hours</TIMEX> to get to work
 	
 	
 		oh my goodness
 	
 	
 		so and so now it takes me <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> minutes
 	
 	
 		well <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">now</TIMEX> was that expected though i mean <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employers</ENAMEX> expected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to not necessarily be there on time due to the delays or
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		
 
 		uh well they not they didn't expect you to be on time but they did expect you to be there and you the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> well you know they also did a very good job of of shoveling the the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		they had the snow plows and the salt <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trucks</ENAMEX> and and uh they just you know they were equipped for it whereas here
 		if you have a bad snow nobody's prepared to do anything about it you know the
 	
 	
 		everything stops yeah
 	
 	
 		right right you know you you you'd you get the first you know the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first first</NUMEX> ice
 		uh storm and the place closes up
 	
 	
 		well now do you work at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TI</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yes uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i was gonna say there've been several times when i know they had ice storms down in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> uh that we would be up here trying to call and it we'd figure out after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about the first hour</TIMEX> that there ain't nobody at work
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		there's nobody there yeah yeah i that happens a lot i i just live <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">ten minutes</TIMEX> away and i don't work i don't work in the at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> site i work at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spring Creek</ENAMEX> site which is which is in Plano
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		and uh and so i usually i can usually make it i n it's just a hop jump and a
 		uh whatever the expression is i'm i'm real close  right  um but uh yeah i'd i'd hate to have to get it go to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> drive into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> when the weather's like that
 	
 	
 		hop skip and a jump there you go
 		well that's good
 		well are you uh do you prefer the kind of weather that you're getting in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> over your <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Hampshire</ENAMEX> or do you miss the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winters</TIMEX> or
 	
 	
 		oh yeah oh yeah well it's like i keep telling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> you don't have to shovel sunshine you know it's uh it's uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it's just great i mean we're really spoiled i mean there's a lot of things we miss about <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New England</ENAMEX> you know uh uh where there's no trees to speak of and the big
 		you know thick <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> we used to have in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New England</ENAMEX> and we used to enjoy it we had a we had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">acres</NUMEX> of land attached to our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house course</ENAMEX> we only had a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">thousand sq uare foot</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> but we had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">acres</NUMEX> of land and um
 	
 	
 		oh my goodness
 	
 	
 		and so we that now we have this we have a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> that's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times as big but we have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than a quarter</NUMEX> acre lot you know and uh and uh
 	
 	
 		sure once you're out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> you're in the street
 	
 	
 		that's right and uh so we kind of it's it's we've gone from one extreme to the other and that's that's been hard to adjust to but uh the weather we can't oh the weather's been wonderful
 	
 	
 		that's good i did go up to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New England</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one time</TIMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">their fall season</TIMEX> when the weather was just
 	
 	
 		oh yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		you know it was kind of a a brisk feeling outside but it wasn't freezing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">leaves</ENAMEX> were turning and now that part of a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> up there i could truly love but uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah oh i can remember uh walking around you know taking a lunch break uh you know when the air's real brisk and the
 		the colors on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> are just so vivid um oh it was just that that's something i miss i i keep i'm  i get homesick thinking about it you know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">uh-oh</ENAMEX> well what about your <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summers</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> now is that similar was it humid up in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New England</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> like it is down there
 	
 	
 		oh yeah humid very humid in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New England</ENAMEX> i mean you got <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundred</NUMEX> degree weather i mean in in in like in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX> area i <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX>'s right on the water
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh you'd have these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundred</NUMEX> degree <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> where the humidity was just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one hundred</NUMEX> percent and it was stifling
 		uh here you in in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> area the humidity you get some <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">humid days</TIMEX> but it's not nearly as bad you get you get a lot of dry days too
 	
 	
 		well so that's really no big tell i tell you what that's funny to hear you talk about that because for me to come to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> in the summer
 		is stifling humidity to me because <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lubbock</ENAMEX> is so dry uh you know it may be a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundred and a hundred and five</NUMEX> or whatever up here but there is no humidity and it's
 	
 	
 		is it  is it okay
 		yeah
 		okay
 	
 	
 		you know if there's a breeze blowing it's a nice comfortable day and you don't feel like you have to take <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> showers <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a day</TIMEX> because you you take a shower and walk outside and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">humidity</ENAMEX>'s so great you know you're sweating to death again
 	
 	
 		oh
 		
 
 		yeah
 		yeah everything's relative i guess yeah because i grew up on the east coast
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and uh i'm originally from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX> and uh and my memories of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> have always been that stifling humidity
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and compared to the humidity here
 		you know in fact uh whenever i think about moving you know whenever we talk maybe about moving back to the east coast the thing that comes back to me is that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sensation</ENAMEX> of those stifling <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summers</TIMEX> which which i don't experience here
