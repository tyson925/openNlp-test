 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yes um i was wondering whether you were in favor of statehood independence or the status quo for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i was a
 		resident although very young of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of what is now the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alaska</ENAMEX> in nineteen fifty <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alaska</ENAMEX> stopped being a territory became a state
 		uh so i guess i have a left over
 		positive feeling about the question even though i don't know very much about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX>
 		um i know that all the things that happened relative to that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">territory</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alaska</ENAMEX> have been very positive uh and i kind have a suspicion that that i
 		believe that a that statehood is a good idea whenever you have a territory the size of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX> one ought either to make it a full-fledged state or or let it go one or the other
 		what is your situation
 	
 	
 		well i'm i guess
 		i don't have such such close experience with with um an area becoming a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> as you do
 		um my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> is the economy because as i understand it <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX> has a very low standard uh standard of living or at least um annual average income
 		um part of this i suppose is justified in in in that the climate they don't need perhaps the heating and the housing that some of the the more northern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">territories</ENAMEX> need
 		however in that case i guess i would favor status quo
 		i have been to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX> and and found it very very interesting i did <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peace Corps</ENAMEX> training there
 	
 	
 		oh that's very interesting
 	
 	
 		and so um you know i saw it also as a young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> and and it was very foreign in a certain sense although i had grown up in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> and so the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> was no problem
 		um it was
 		it was you know very lovely and and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> seemed very friendly and and nice i have actually i work with uh
 		a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX> and i guess i have never thought to ask her which she favors
 		uh
 	
 	
 		your <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> on the economies was one in terms of if it became a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> would that put even more pressures on on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX> or pressures on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US</ENAMEX> in terms of aid or
 	
 	
 		well probably more on in terms of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US</ENAMEX>
 		um
 		you know i'm i'm not quite sure how the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> copes
 		with this sort of thing i've lived abrode abroad most of my life so
 		i guess i i've been very cut off uh i lived actually in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lebanon</ENAMEX> so i was very cut off from the
 		the press as i was you know
 		and uh becoming was becoming an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult</ENAMEX> so i don't know how the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> would cope with it a
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		new <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> that is so very very poor
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um i guess you know we'd have a lot of aid if if you consider the inner <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> of
 		like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> and and how much aid it needs i suppose the whole <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> or the whole um new <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> would require such aid
 	
 	
 		i guess
 		um
 		we're assuming that that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX> would be per capita significantly more poor perhaps than than say <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mississippi</ENAMEX> or
 	
 	
 		i think so
 	
 	
 		okay
 		that's something that that i guess i have not much of an image of other than
 		than <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX> as a tropical <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> and consequently large numbers of barefoot <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">natives</ENAMEX> or something uh not in a
 		pejorative sense but in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a in a carefree</TIMEX> sense i guess although i'm aware of the political problems and unrest and and and also difficulties they have
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um
 		i don't know whether state would statehood would improve their economy i don't i don't know that the very the act of being a state
 		would would have any impact on on them uh i guess they would have the ability to do some taxing that they don't have now but of course if their economy is weak that there is not much of a base on which to tax
 		i don't know if they suffer
 		in a sense of
 		income loss as being since they aren't a state whether there are monies that escape them so to speak because they aren't able to tax like a typical <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> would be
 		how do you feel though about
 		well i guess it's to their advantage to be a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">territory</ENAMEX> but uh i wonder how having having been in a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">territory</ENAMEX> but only as a young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> were in the military at the time so they didn't have ready negative feelings about being in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> in the
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alaska</ENAMEX> at the time since they they voted absentee
 		i i would imagine that it must be a little bit of a second feeling of <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> class citizenry
 		uh to be in a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">territory</ENAMEX> that large and not being able to vote the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">District of Columbia</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> for instance are quite frustrated i think at times
 		in their not having a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> representative
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah those those are good points um which obviously i'd never thought about
 		um
 		i don't know what uh i suppose
 		they also not being a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> are
 		probably freer to determine their own
 		um ways of life than they would if if
 		i i'm trying to think exactly what is imposed if they would become a state versus a territory
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		perhaps compulsory education
 	
 	
 		uh i see what you mean so that
 	
 	
 		um
 		and taxes
 	
 	
 		yeah taxes would undoubtedly be occurring uh there i don't know i i don't even understand exactly how taxes are handled in a territorial situation
 		um
 		frequently the laws in a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">territory</ENAMEX> are are in some ways as stringent as they are in other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> i uh and i'm thinking in terms of education but then again each <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> sets its own and i don't know how a territorial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX> takes care of something like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX>
 		um it's interesting because i hadn't thought of them in terms of the problems relative to uh economy
 		uh
 		i had thought of it more in terms of political uh
 		realization and i guess i had automatically made the assumption that gee anyone would rather be a state of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> than an independent country
 	
 	
 		um-hum well well actually i think <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one one</NUMEX> thing that i remember hearing in the news <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past couple weeks</TIMEX> that might be significant is that
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		they've recently voted that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> is the official language which i always assumed it was anyway
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so if they've just taken such action
 		it would seem to indicate to me either they're doing it because they're afraid they might become a state and want
 		to declare this before they become a state
 		or maybe because they don't want to become a state for fear of losing the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanic</ENAMEX> heritage
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		that's interesting
 		well it sounds as though you are in favor of uh status quo
 	
 	
 		i i believe i would probably tend towards that
 	
 	
 		and i think uh having listened to you relative to the economy thing i think if i were being forced to make a decision i would plead ignorance and wait to do more research before picking one of these so i'm ultimately i guess i'm ultimately in favor of status quo also
 	
 	
 		well that's interesting
 	
 	
 		at this point
 		leaning towards uh statehood
 	
 	
 		right what about if if um they demanded to have <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> as the official language
 		as a condition for statehood
 	
 	
 		i think i would be troubled i suspect i believe that any of our <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> and i i constitutionally i don't think there are any prescriptions about against that decision even if uh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Louisiana</ENAMEX> chose to go with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Creole</ENAMEX> or something
 		um
 		i don't think there is any prohibitions i would be bothered by that i'm i'm bothered by any tendency to resist what i think was one of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>'s strengths and that's the the the melting pot uh i i
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		am particularly fond of a number of ethnic cuisines but i'm troubled by too close a clinging to to the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past</TIMEX> and i'm also realizing that that a common language i think is the ultimate bond of a country
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> i guess comes to my mind as they're going through the throes up there relative to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Quebec</ENAMEX> and whatever uh that i i think that would be
 		a a negative step to make and i think that that they would need to reassess that
 		um
 		i'm troubled even in by bilingualism uh in so far as t hat it intrudes it gets in the way of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">of</NUMEX> of the melting pot aspect
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		that's interesting because
 		although i tend to be bilingual <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> based on experience
 		uh
 		i was in bilingual education in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> and
 		i didn't have any problem with my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> but i noticed my
 		my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> who who was uh quite a bit younger
 		was learning <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Spanish</ENAMEX> in elementar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">y school</ENAMEX> and he can't speak a word
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		and so obviously it didn't work in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		but i'm rather in favor of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> being bilingual and i'd be quite happy to see a national law in which every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> was required to learn <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> and a second language
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 	
 	
 		but i'm  i'm disturbed by a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> that attempts to be functionally bilingual at the official level
 	
 	
 		oh i see
 	
 	
 		um
 		i'm i'm concerned about whether or not that causes fractiousness i guess
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		well i think we have gone to time and i appreciate your having called
 	
 	
 		okay okay well thank you very much
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">good-bye</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		bye-bye
