 
     		
 	
 		all right
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		uh we've got a lot of them  too many of them
 	
 	
 		oh yes  and i believe we all do and it's it's just too easy to use
 	
 	
 		yeah well my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>'s real good at using them
 	
 	
 		oh i believe that uh <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mine</ENAMEX> would say the same uh but uh i seem too rely on them too much
 	
 	
 		i don't have any of them i don't carry them he carries them i try to take them away from him
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um it uh you know i seem to uh use those more than i do cash in fact i'd rather carry the cards than i would the uh cash
 	
 	
 		yeah well we got in a spot of trouble with uh using uh the credit cards on gas
 	
 	
 		uh yes
 	
 	
 		and uh that's got us in trouble
 	
 	
 		yes that's real easy to do i have to watch it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		in fact yeah uh we i can understand that predicament
 		um
 		they they've um you know they've they've made them too easy and too accessible at everything to to buy
 	
 	
 		the ATM machines
 	
 	
 		oh yes
 	
 	
 		those things there that's what gets us
 	
 	
 		and then plus then you for end up forgetting to write it down
 	
 	
 		well no he doesn't have that trouble he uh has this little slip that comes out with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh ATM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">machine</ENAMEX> and he just keeps that he keeps fairly decent records
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 		oh that's good
 	
 	
 		but uh he knows when he's overspends and when he doesn't and he knows that anytime he pops out that credit card  you know i've used the credit card <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a couple</NUMEX> times to pay bills
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh yeah yes uh and then then that gets into a vicious circle
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		as far as you know paying off the the the loan that you just got from the credit card to pay off the other loan
 	
 	
 		yeah that's what he's talking about doing now
 	
 	
 		oh no
 		um yeah the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATM</ENAMEX>'s they're but they're nice though to have in case you need to get some quick cash and everything is closed
 	
 	
 		yeah well yeah i like them i i have to admit i do like my credit cards uh i love it when he decides to go in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX> and buy something for me
 	
 	
 		oh that's the best way it's used that's the best way yes now i think that sort of
 		evens it out as far as uh letting them carry it so as long as they do buy us something
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i don't know i like that he walks in you know and he's got this little gift and how'd you pay for it credit  he you know said whipped out my little card
 	
 	
 		
 
 		and see there's no secrecy to that because the bill always comes in and we know how much they pay for it
 	
 	
 		yeah i'd never thought about that way i don't really look  i guess i ought to sometimes
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh i have to open it you know they mine always charges the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> so i can always end up saying oh you spent too much you know and so yeah
 	
 	
 		well i think the best thing he bought for me off of them is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nintendo</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh
 		those are fun
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you get started on them and can't quit
 	
 	
 		like credit cards  oh no never thought of it that way either he's you know he's addicted to it at times
 	
 	
 		just exactly
 		
 
 		oh it's it's real easy to get addicted to them you know you get out on a shopping spree frenzy and uh just charge it all and then you don't have to write a check or anything
 	
 	
 		and see the thing is you know he go out and he'll spend it when he wants you know and uh uh i'm afraid to i'm afraid to use that credit card
 	
 	
 		yeah is there is a a fear to it as far as what happens if
 	
 	
 		yeah you know uh is he going to yell at me for buying this with this you know and
 		he's not a yeller though but
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		he calmly you know you shouldn't have spent it all on that
 	
 	
 		yeah they
 	
 	
 		he likes to buy the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> toys  with the uh credit card too you you know he'll go to by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wal-Mart</ENAMEX> or something and
 	
 	
 		oh yeah that's it
 		oh yeah there's that's a weakness there that's just
 		you know you you always want to get your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> everything and uh you don't care how much it costs or what it takes
 	
 	
 		yeah well uh
 		i don't know the uh
 		uh the uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wal-Mart</ENAMEX> that's where all of our bills are for the credit card
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah that's uh i always end up going into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wal-Mart</ENAMEX> and  coming out with everything that uh i didn't have on the list
 		we're just getting more than what we went in for
 	
 	
 		but we went in for uh
 		uh something for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day last week</TIMEX> and he went we went and bought a potty chair uh uh one of those <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ninja Turtles</ENAMEX> for my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> uh you know the potty chair for my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> and he bought the
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		a pair of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shoes</ENAMEX> for me and uh let's see what else did he he bought <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a couple</NUMEX> pairs of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">shoes</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> you know i got <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> and he bought them shoes with it and uh
 	
 	
 		oh yeah it's dangerous
 	
 	
 		you know we went in for a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> dollar piece of thing for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> and ended up <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixty seventy</TIMEX> dollars for uh at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wal-Mart</ENAMEX> and then we went to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Payless</ENAMEX> and bought the shoes for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um-hum oh yeah it's just too easy to do you go in for just one thing we're we're infamous about that
 		and so
 	
 	
 		yeah i'll second that
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh well yeah i well i'm i'm glad we have credit cards that's uh
 		because in sometimes when there's an emergency it it comes in handy
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's nice to have
 	
 	
 		i know we had the car break down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time and the uh credit card saved us
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		we've yeah we've had uh
 		a sick <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> and uh
 		the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vet</ENAMEX> you know the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vet</ENAMEX>'s are so expensive that uh we uh the credit card helped us a lot there too so we wouldn't do without them
 	
 	
 		i don't think we'd live
 	
 	
 		huh-uh no no i think it's become too much of an everyday life here they're part of it
 	
 	
 		yeah well i've been asking my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> for the credit cards i've got all of them but one
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i just hide them from him and when i feel that it's necessary to pull it out i'll pull it out but he keeps <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of them
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		he keeps the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> with the least amount of the uh uh what you call it yeah no the uh
 	
 	
 		the balance
 	
 	
 		credit line you know uh the credit limit i let him have the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> with the least amount
 	
 	
 		oh yes uh-huh
 		so you know he can't spend too much
 	
 	
 		yeah you know uh i don't really exactly remember how much it is i think it's <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about five hundred</NUMEX> limit uh you know it's just uh just one for him to fiddle with
 	
 	
 		yes um-hum
 	
 	
 		i have to think of something else i'm i'm blank
 	
 	
 		i was i was just uh
 		oh well let's see i guess we've talked what almost <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five minutes</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		well <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">six minutes</TIMEX> i've got a timer on my uh
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		clock on my phone
 	
 	
 		oh i wish i had one of those
 	
 	
 		well we bought this with credit too  well we found it with a clearance uh down in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Memphis</ENAMEX> i guess and uh

 		huh
 	
 	
 		so well uh
 	
 	
 		you know we got to get back to credit cards
 	
 	
 		yeah well i was just trying to think uh i think we've pretty much said it all
 	
 	
 		it
 	
 	
 		um but
 		so uh but yeah uh i think we couldn't make it without them
 	
 	
 		i know i couldn't uh we went and we maxed out quite a few of them before uh i started taking the uh
 		cards away we maxed out a lot of well we had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about six or seven</NUMEX> and we maxed them out
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		that's got us in a little bit of trouble now that's why we and we was using one of them to pay off the bills on the others and that got that in trouble there
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah yeah
 		but uh we uh we try to keep a uh
 		uh tight controls over over them but it it gets hard like especially around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas time</TIMEX> and birthdays
 	
 	
 		uh uh my hubby does not have uh
 		too much control when it comes to using that card uh  i know uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh for quite a while we was using them to uh
 		i think even <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time we used it to pay our rent
 	
 	
 		oh goodness
 	
 	
 		you know it uh
 		we first moved here we just had a little bit of trouble and we got in to too expensive of a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> rather and uh you know he was only down here for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and we just everything just piled up wrecked the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> and you know in order to do that we had to you know we was  paying
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		the rent plus trying plus trying to get the money for another car another car and
 	
 	
 		it gets rough
 	
 	
 		it got it got real rough
 	
 	
 		that's hard
 	
 	
 		he just popped out that uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Master Card</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		get that cash advance uh-huh
 	
 	
 		yeah we got big cash advance and really that's what's uh holding us back now that's
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah it uh it but see it does come in handy those they do they're worth it
 		oh well i i think we've pretty much come to an end here
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm trying to find out how long we're supposed talk
 	
 	
 		i think it was <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">at least five minutes</TIMEX> wasn't it
 	
 	
 		that's what i'm looking for now that's why i was just trying to talk without having to think about what i was saying and uh trying to look over this thing
