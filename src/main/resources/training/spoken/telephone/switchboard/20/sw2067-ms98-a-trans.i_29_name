 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well um with credit cards is me i uh i try to get maybe <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">just one or two</TIMEX> i don't i don't like having credit cards for every store i i uh i just don't like them
 	
 	
 		what are you afraid of with them
 	
 	
 		what am i afraid of um i don't know if i'm really afraid of spending too much i just uh don't think that i need them you know i uh
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		they are tempting at times but i i just you know
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		sometimes i just don't like everybody knowing everything about me you know so
 	
 	
 		well that's very can be very very true
 	
 	
 		so and the you know everybody just gives you a credit card just so you'll spend money so
 	
 	
 		well that's the idea they figure that if they give you a card at no charge for a whole year that you will use it and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		that's right see they make money off of it whether you use it or not
 	
 	
 		absolutely well the other thing of course is the fact that they hope you will not pay your bill at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the month</TIMEX> so that you will be paying interest
 	
 	
 		that's right uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i use <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mine</ENAMEX> a great deal um for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">groceries</ENAMEX> for everything that i can and then just write one check at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the month</TIMEX> for the entire thing right
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		that's what i do
 		that's what i do just a second  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whitney</ENAMEX>
 		i will i'm on the phone honey
 		sorry
 	
 	
 		that's all right sounds like you have a little one there oh you have great how old are they
 	
 	
 		i have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> little ones yeah yeah so that always want some um <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four and two</NUMEX> and half
 	
 	
 		oh boy those are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> very active age
 	
 	
 		yes so yeah um i'm i'm like you i i use my only use my credit card for um
 		you know when i you know i just use it whenever i feel like i don't want to write a check and then but i don't charge anything that i can't payoff at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the month</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well uh do you uh do you ever use the ATM machines
 	
 	
 		so
 		no i never do my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> does at work just to get cash out but uh i take the checkbook so i you know i just if i need cash i just tell him and he gets it out and i don't even think i know my number
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well i find it a great use from the standpoint that you don't have to continue to write checks in order to get cash
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh</ENAMEX> that's right see we he couldn't do without it he but you know since he can just do it right there at work for nothing
 	
 	
 		oh that helps right well the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">the other</NUMEX> thing some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are not aware of is they will use their a their credit card like their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Visa</ENAMEX> or their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MasterCard</ENAMEX> for cash
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and when they do that they begin paying interest right from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that very day</TIMEX> on
 	
 	
 		you're right and that's kind of silly
 	
 	
 		yeah right absolutely because they figure that  that's correct  the idea is to use their money
 	
 	
 		yeah your defeating the purpose
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 		and uh during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that whole month</TIMEX> and then pay it at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the month</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i mean i get i get <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one or two</NUMEX> a week <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to you know sending me a credit card or calling me on the phone and i just say i don't want it because i
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		right well i think that's the only thing you can do is just say no and mean no and not be tempted
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah it's like
 		i'd like to know where they determine that i'm such a good credit risk that they can go and say you get this much credit line you know you've already been preapproved
 	
 	
 		well it
 		and oh absolutely preapproved that's their favorite word
 	
 	
 		yes everybody in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> is preapproved i think
 	
 	
 		i think so you're right well it's interesting uh that uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have the generally the same view of credit cards no matter where you go
 	
 	
 		
 
 		so
 		yeah
 		uh-huh yeah and then some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> they get so wrapped up in them that they find you know <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX> they find
 		wow i didn't realize i had this much you know i'd spent this much money and then they can't meet <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the minimum monthly</TIMEX> payments on it
 	
 	
 		that much spent right
 		well and some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> use one credit card to pay for another credit card they own and i mean that does nothing but exacerbate the entire problem
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah it does because you're you know you you're you know you're just costing costing yourself more money because you if you can't make the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</TIMEX> the minimum payment you're paying interest again so yeah
 	
 	
 		that's right that's right well it's been enjoyable talking with you
 	
 	
 		yes it's enjoyable talking with seeing that somebody feels the same way so well you you too good luck bye-bye
 	
 	
 		
  
 		right well take good care take care of your little ones uh-huh bye-bye
