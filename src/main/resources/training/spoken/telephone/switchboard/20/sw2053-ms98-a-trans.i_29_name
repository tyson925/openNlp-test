 		um i do a lot of cross-stitching and painting when i do have spare time oh i love it
 	
 	
 		really i like cross-stitch too
 		
 
 		i just have a hard time finding any spare time lately
 	
 	
 		i'm that's my case also i've got a new born and and there's just no time
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		have have you been cross-stitching long
 	
 	
 		oh several years my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> is even interested in it now he likes to help me design um you know projects that are a little more customized
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		mine sort of he looks at the pattern and he says how do you get that from there to the to the material
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		not that hard i really i really enjoy it
 	
 	
 		but oh its not
 		and once uh once you get started on it it's just oh i just i love it i do a lot of my own patterns also
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		in fact i did one uh Bill the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cat</ENAMEX> you know from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glenn County</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		that uh was a real good one to do
 		it was it was tough but uh
 		yeah do you have any others or is it just mainly cross-stitch
 	
 	
 		um i do mostly that um not very artistic really for like painting and stuff
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 		um
 	
 	
 		but now i don't know
 	
 	
 		yeah uh but i well i'm still trying to get all the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMC</ENAMEX> colors
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		yeah i've got the kits to to put them all in i don't have them all yet
 	
 	
 		uh right yeah uh got to counting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the other day</TIMEX> and uh i think i have what was it <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two hundred</NUMEX> and i got to thinking the money that i've got invested in this
 	
 	
 		certainly
 	
 	
 		is uh it uh yeah it can add up quick
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		i just i just keep an inventory of what i currently have and then when i start a a new project i go through and see if i if i you know just buy the colors that i need of what i'm low on
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		right i see well now can i
 		improvise with adding using another color color instead you know what comes close
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		because a lot of them are are similar
 	
 	
 		yeah a lot of times you can do that
 		think the i think the pinks there's like <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">forty two</NUMEX> different shades of pink
 	
 	
 		good grief yeah there's there's lots of pinks and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">greens</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pinks</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">greens</ENAMEX> yeah
 	
 	
 		there's lots of shades of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">greens</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but the colors are i just love all the different colors
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		they had they had quite a few new ones come out <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX>
 		that they added to
 		but but you don't have much spare time either
 	
 	
 		well not lately
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i even started a new job and trying to get
 		acclimated there
 	
 	
 		oh yes and that does take sometime yes we're trying to get acclimated with the uh with having a baby and there's just he's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven months</TIMEX> old
 	
 	
 		yeah how old
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and just into everything so there's not a spare moment
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		oh but i wouldn't trade it for the world i've been trying to do some bibs for him
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh and and work on his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> stocking
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		we missed it the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last year</TIMEX> so hopefully <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> he'll have one
 	
 	
 		yeah well <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> he was a little bit young for having one
 	
 	
 		uh right right
 	
 	
 		probably wouldn't have enjoyed it anyway
 	
 	
 		he oh he liked right if it tasted good yeah  uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		you would have but
 	
 	
 		uh yeah all he liked was the lights <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> so
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh well that's neat that uh you like cross-stitch also

 		yeah uh uh
 	
 	
 		it to which oh
 	
 	
 		oh i'm sorry go ahead
 	
 	
 		no that's okay

 		oh wow no i just started about
 		well <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five years ago</TIMEX> i think
