 
     		
 	
 		
 
 		well the first thing for me is i wonder i see a couple of different ways of talking about what privacy is um
 		if privacy is something that disturbs your private state i mean an invasion of privacy is something that disturbs your private <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> that's
 		one thing and if privacy is something that comes into your private <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> and extracts information from it in other words finds something out about you that's another and the first kind of
 		invasion of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> type of privacy seems invaded to me in very much everyday in this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> but in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> type at least overtly uh where someone comes in and uh
 		finds out information about you that should be private uh does not seem uh
 		um obviously everyday
 	
 	
 		i i think i agree with that i think in a good example on the
 		typical thing that happens uh when the phone rang and it's <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> calling my immediate reaction is that it's some sort of strange phone message and then i realize oh no this is something i solicited
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		so my immediate reaction was one of that sense of invasion but after that i realized no i i really wanted this and it was sort of exciting and so that was almost an example of a situation an invasion that turns out to be not invasive
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		right it turned out to be uh uh an invitation
 	
 	
 		exactly uh and at the same time i think that i receive on on the order of
 		uh probably <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">eight</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a week</TIMEX> calls of the nature where <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> wishes that there were a convenient way to just hang up on it
 	
 	
 		from from personal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> or from these uh phone answering phone uh commercial things
 	
 	
 		commercial solicitations solicitations primarily
 	
 	
 		oh that that's a remarkable number i get them rarely and i'm still astounded that that uh one they let anyone do them and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> that they have any effectiveness whatsoever  um
 		because i'm usually so insulted by them i just hang up as soon as i recognize what they are
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i think they prey on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>'s um
 		inherent politeness on the phone even with a machine i find <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> being kind of polite and waiting for it to finish what it has to say and then they feel an obligation to respond even though there's not even a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> there
 	
 	
 		and i think that's what makes one feel invaded is the fact that there seems to be little control and you one's feeling obligated because uh some sense of of the way the ritual is played out
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and and uh that that then ends up being the the most common example for me
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um i guess i'm not
 		typically feeling invaded in my privacy relative to this second
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		this one that you raised and i don't think i would have thought about that i think that's a good idea on your part i don't typically feel intruded on on the things oh in the sense of finding out information
 	
 	
 		well presumably those who find out such information if they are doing it i would prefer to not to be known and i mean you know the classic
 		oh i don't know <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> conspiracy theories or whatever would have uh such <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> trying to do it without your knowledge so there's
 		things that invade that <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> type of privacy
 		where you do know about them and possibly things that invade that <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> type of privacy without you knowing about it and
 		i can't talk about the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> other than to to to generate <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">paranoia  yeah</ENAMEX> to surmise and i'd like to think that's it's quite low at least in this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> i don't feel like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KGB</ENAMEX> is monitoring my phone or anything like that
 	
 	
 		to surmise to surmise it is there
 		
 
 		well i guess although
 		i well that's a good point where you said that how does one define what invasion of privacy is because uh if that's the case of a tree falling in the forest and i'm not feeling invaded then maybe my privacy hasn't been because i have no sense of my privacy state having been invaded
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um if your defining it in terms of information gone even if it's something you don't know about it well then i guess one could assume one was invaded but i don't feel invaded by it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i don't have a sense of threat in general from those sorts of things i'm not sure why uh i guess it comes from a sense of facts or facts and if someone finds out something about me that is true i i don't have a sense of loss from that
 	
 	
 		um-hum well you must have a relatively clean conscience then
 	
 	
 		uh the the other side of that might be uh if if someone there's someone found out something or surmised something that weren't true then i would feel probably more invaded in the gossipy sort of sense
 	
 	
 		yes yes you'd be more harmed or something yeah
 	
 	
 		because right because you don't have anyway to turn it off there did you hear about this Lotus database that was being put together
 	
 	
 		yes i did i was just about to write a letter when i heard they canceled it
 	
 	
 		that would be an example where my sense of threat would be high because i would find that there'd be could good possibility that their facts were were fantasy
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and then i would feel not only invaded in the sense that someone had obtained information from me that i would rather they didn't and that might be the sense of a spending pattern for instance that that i would have thought to be private but then if it turns out to generate
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		incorrect things that's even worse uh or if my call rate of of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight to or so</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a week</TIMEX> went up even higher because  uh someone had had
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		they had you pegged
 	
 	
 		right as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> who had takes unsolicited phones calls and pays money and then all of a sudden you get your <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty a week</TIMEX> because now their advertising you right exactly
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		
 
 		yeah
 		yeah and i one of the problems with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lotus</ENAMEX> database was uh that it was uncontrolled access to who would have that information i mean they said they would give it out to only select <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> but
 		uh you know just like software is only given out to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> i mean you can't believe that  it would it would be pirated and they wouldn't bother to check that carefully anyway to someone who's offering
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		you know full cash price for it i mean you know you can't tell what what a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> really has to do with it and there's something rather ominous about having
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		virtually anyone any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hacker</ENAMEX> being able to know what your income is what your spending habits are and you know and
 		and that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hacker</ENAMEX> just has to get into in touch with a sneak <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">thief</ENAMEX> and suddenly and then what started as an invasion of privacy can be you know an invasion of your actual home
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		and i guess that turns out to be the basic problem with any invasion of privacy is whether or not you're feeling threatened as a result of of it so so maybe that is a a little bit of what privacy is
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yes exactly
 		um-hum i also hm thought about it because i was uh waiting to talk to you that another thing
 		that occurred to me is there's not so much invasion of my privacy because i know how to behave such that there isn't
 		but i realized i have to behave in a certain way in order to not have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> invade my privacy if i deviate from social norms of behavior if i run up and down the street yelling or something someone's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">gonna</ENAMEX> invade my privacy very quickly and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i realize that that i mean
 		i can take that for granted but i used to i used to live in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> and
 		things are quite different there in terms of that there's less of a sense of privacy in fact it's said that no <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> language has a word for privacy certainly a language i know doesn't but just has a word for loneliness loneliness is the closest you can come which is really quite different
 	
 	
 		oh that's interesting
 		but but no concept for wanting to be private
 	
 	
 		yeah it's it's generally being alone is not a very desirable state at least officially
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		um so there's not i mean doors don't have latches on them <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> don't tend to knock you just if there's a door closed you open it because it's in your way you <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> walk in and out and
 		as a as a westerner in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> i was often surprised and felt my sense of privacy there was quite invaded
 	
 	
 		oh that that would be
 		that'd be culturally shocking
 	
 	
 		you know it it very much is but on the other hand i realized i could go out on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> and act like a complete lunatic
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> would leave me alone
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		whereas in this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> where everyone respects the closed doors very much if you go out and act like the lunatic you you violate the uh the norms of social of um public behavior um
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> start paying attention to you very much and they start asking <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">q uestions</ENAMEX> and in a sense are invite invade invading your privacy although if you know what the social norms are you know quote unquote you asked for it
 		but it does mean that you have yet another reason to follow a set of social norms
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		and which isn't alway always the case in all cultures and it wasn't until i was thinking about it just now that i realized that's actually something that's culturally relative
 	
 	
 		that that is true i hadn't thought about that and and that is fascinating to to think about someone who doesn't know how to say private
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		and they've really um well i mean i i wonder how <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have sex and things like that i mean they obviously  you go to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> and it's obvious you know the results of sex are quite obvious as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> goes up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an extra hundred million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every few years</TIMEX> um but i i just don't quite
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		um
 		there's hope i actually for all for the time i've spent there i still don't quite understand how certain things that i assume and require privacy and require not just that you be alone but actually that you have a sense of privacy
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		because anyone can be alone for oh some period of time but for me a lot of what i do requires a sense that
 		there's this invisible barrier around me which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> will respect will respect and if that's gone um i i really really don't know how to live very well and i wonder i really do wonder how <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> do that
 	
 	
 		yes
 		that's interesting are there are there any other specific things that that you feel like where where you feel your privacy to be invaded on a day-to-day basis or either growing on a growing frequency
 	
 	
 		well the classic the other classic examples the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Jehovah's Witness or or Mormons</ENAMEX> or someone knocking at the front door um
 		which is more intrusive because i have to feel really tell someone to go away and there's that sense of i have now opened my door they now see
 		what i look like what i live like and normally and they're doing something that normally i really only invite <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to because i
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> anyone any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> anyone i give my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">number</ENAMEX> to is welcome to call me but no one is just welcome to come by my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> so that is more of a sense of invasion
 	
 	
 		so that's another example of the invasion because of a nonsolicited
