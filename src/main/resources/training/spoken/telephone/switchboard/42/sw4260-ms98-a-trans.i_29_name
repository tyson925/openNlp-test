 
     		
 	
 		in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the evening</TIMEX> back there now isn't it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		pardon
 	
 	
 		what time is it back there right now
 	
 	
 		it's uh about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven thirty</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so have you been golfing yet this year
 	
 	
 		uh no actually i'm uh quite a beginner i'm very green i just got my <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> set of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clubs</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> but i have uh gone out to the driving range once or twice
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		to uh see if i can work on my swing a little bit
 	
 	
 		oh good yeah i'm not that much i've gone about i guess <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about twenty twenty</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> times
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		no i'm not a beginner but i'm not a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">novice</ENAMEX> either
 	
 	
 		little bit more experience though
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah it takes quite a bit i used to go just about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this one summer</TIMEX> and i did really good and then the more i practiced the worse i got
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		so i got frustrated but i heard that happens to everyone
 	
 	
 		now how how much out of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> or how long out of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> can you play where you live
 	
 	
 		um we couldn't start playing right now
 		there's a few <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX> open
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um pretty much until end of probably <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX> and if it snows or not
 	
 	
 		oh that's not bad uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so it is a quite a long season
 	
 	
 		i would have thought that uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this time of the year</TIMEX> here i might be able to get out a little bit but uh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Winter</ENAMEX> seems to be dragging on up here and we have snow right now
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		but uh i noticed a lot of the driving ranges outdoor driving ranges do um if if you want to play outside in the cold
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you can you can sweep the snow off the uh tees and and play from there but we also have a lot of indoor driving ranges and and that's a little bit strange getting used to swinging the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">club</ENAMEX> inside and
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		and uh hitting the ball into a net instead of letting it fly
 	
 	
 		yeah because you don't know for sure can you tell if you're slice much on those
 	
 	
 		um i can tell i can because i slice so terribly bad  i'm still trying to work on that
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but uh i don't know i've noticed that it's mostly the real beginners like myself that that will do that it seems like the real experienced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>'ll wait um until they can play outside and really hit the ball
 	
 	
 		uh-huh do you use your own balls on those
 		on the net
 	
 	
 		i i'm sorry using own balls my own balls
 	
 	
 		yeah when you hit against a net and indoor
 	
 	
 		you can get a bucket of balls like you would on an outdoor  we're going to try something new we haven't done this yet a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a few</NUMEX> of us are going to go to a place where they have big uh video screens
 	
 	
 		oh they okay provide
 	
 	
 		and they advertise courses like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pebble Beach</ENAMEX> and a few others
 	
 	
 		yeah i played that once  <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pebble Beach</ENAMEX> i played
 	
 	
 		did you do that once
 		oh really the real <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pebble Beach</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um no no i wish  the the screen one
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh okay you did that so that must be fairly common
 	
 	
 		yeah well they were trying it out here is i did it about gee <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six or seven years ago</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and so i don't how much more advanced they got when i tried it it was all right
 	
 	
 		was it is it like fairly realistic or
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		maybe they improved on that because when i did it it was all right but it wasn't that impressive
 	
 	
 		no well we haven't done it yet but uh it it sounds like fun and it looked like fun so we figure we'd just go do it once to see what it's like
 	
 	
 		yeah i kind of experienced it once
 	
 	
 		but i'm getting kind of antsy to to really polish my stroke up a little bit more my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father-in-law</ENAMEX>'s a real avid <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">golfer</ENAMEX> he plays <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six days a week three hundred</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixty five days</TIMEX> out of the year
 	
 	
 		oh really retired
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah he's retired and living out on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">west coast</ENAMEX> where it's warm enough that he can play outside <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all year</TIMEX> round
 	
 	
 		
 
 		you imagine doing that
 	
 	
 		no i don't think i can it's funny because he uh his his knees are shot from uh he was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">surgeon</ENAMEX> and his knees are shot from being on his <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">feet</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all day</TIMEX> everyday
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		and uh he has artificial knees he doesn't get around to well but he still plays eighteen holes of golf everyday
 	
 	
 		wow i didn't know that would hurt hurt hurt you standing all the time
 	
 	
 		evidently yeah so he uh i don't know he's got his own little <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">golf cart</ENAMEX> that he putts over to the country <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">club</ENAMEX> in and
 	
 	
 		
  
 		huh
 	
 	
 		and he gets around okay in fact i did go out with him when we were out there for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> and went right after i got my clubs i did go out with him once and
 		we uh knocked the ball right it was pretty dull for him seeing how i had to hit it <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about twenty</TIMEX> times before i got onto the green
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that's why i've never chored so much in my life until i went golfing
 	
 	
 		
  
 		yeah uh do you you belong to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">club</ENAMEX> or anything
 	
 	
 		no it's just
 		just once in but i'll probably go <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about three or four</NUMEX> times during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX> i don't even have my own clubs
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i usually get a hold of someone that lets me use them i really enjoy the game
 	
 	
 		well i'm left handed and i found that i couldn't always get a hold of good left handed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clubs</ENAMEX> or any left handed clubs whatsoever really
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and i did try it once i'm hopeless i'm not even i can't do anything with my right hand but i did try using right handed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clubs</ENAMEX> once and it it was so awkward for me
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so i i figured it it might be a good investment i i better be sure and serious about getting into it or else the uh the investment isn't very good
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		has your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> golfed
 	
 	
 		um a little bit here and there not a whole lot she's uh she used to play more but um her shoulders started bothering her
