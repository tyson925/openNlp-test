 
		
 			
 				i've got some pretty firm feelings on this one and that is that we are definitely not getting our money's worth
 			
 			
 				
 			
 			
 				um primarily uh i think the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> big thing that stands out among all this is uh the amount of money that our taxes go to to pay for interest on the federal deficit which is just an absolute inexcusable waste
 			
 			
 				<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 				it's about uh <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">twenty percent</NUMEX> of the federal budget isn't it at this moment
 			
 			
 				
 				it's terrible you know it's huge i have no idea what the actual number is but it
 			
 			
 				but you can't unfortunately you can't do anything about that except get rid of the budget deficit and
 				not at this point in the business cycle you can't
 			
 			
 				yeah i think that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that um orchestrated this and engineered our having the deficit should have appreciated you know what it was ultimately going to cost it was a very bad decision to start letting that grow
 			
 			
 				yeah
 				yeah i would agree with that it was we were actually in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty years ago</TIMEX> we were not in bad shape we had we had been in pretty bad shape after <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War Two</ENAMEX> and then we paid off some of the debt of or at least we inflated it away which is probably more what happened and uh
 			
 			
 				
 			
 			
 				then at the end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Johnson Administration</ENAMEX> the budget <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> year that was that was uh set up by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX> was balanced and that was the last balanced budget we've got well of course part of the problem is that that um
 			
 			
 				hum
 			
 			
 				the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> just grows and it seems like that the only way to restrain it
 				is to restrain the increase in taxes if taxes are increased uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> finds a way to spend it even you know given even that despite the fact that we have a budget deficit
 			
 			
 				yeah absolutely
 			
 			
 				i think what we really need to do is concentrate more on reducing waste on assuring that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> be efficient you know we need more programs where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> get rewarded for money saving suggestions we
 			
 			
 				yeah absolutely
 				and that's that's a terrible problem as well
 			
 			
 				
 				we need more programs to well i mean for example a tax reform law okay a so called tax reform of nineteen <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eighty six</NUMEX> began as a tax simplification law
 				which would've made it easier to enforce and would've saved us i mean another way that they in effect increase your taxes is by increasing the amount that you have to pay to get them prepared or the amount of time you need to take to get your records in order
 			
 			
 				<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 			
 			
 				and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eighty six</NUMEX> tax reform well just made it more complicated even though it started as a simplification bill if i were <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald Reagan</ENAMEX> i would've said unless that reduces the size of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> code by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> percent i'm going to veto it
 			
 			
 				well as much as that's a bad thing i think that uh there's some other really major major things that need straightened out and you'd mentioned waste a little while ago
 			
 			
 				<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 			
 			
 				and uh i've seen with my own eyes a tremendous amount of government waste i was in the marine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">corps</ENAMEX> and we had uh <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">several hundred thousand dollars</NUMEX> worth of transformers sitting on the wall that had been contracted out
 				to be built as replacement parts for an old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Westinghouse Radar Westinghouse</ENAMEX> wasn't going to support it anymore and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spencer</ENAMEX> you know <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Spencer Gifts</ENAMEX>
 				that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> said they'd go ahead and build these things and they didn't build them to specifications so they were unusable they were too physically large to go back in and we spent um <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">four thousand dollars</NUMEX> apiece on those things and there they just sat there taking up valuable space in
 			
 			
 				
 			
 			
 				front of everybody and they were there the whole time i was down there
 			
 			
 				another thing that that that that reminds me of is um I was talking to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who work at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T Gilford Center</ENAMEX>
 			
 			
 				<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 			
 			
 				and they have a government contract to do work on some computer for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> i'm not sure what it's called called but it's some uh military standard architecture with a with a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixteen</TIMEX> bit address space i mean they're still working with a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixteen</TIMEX> bit address space
 			
 			
 				uh no
 			
 			
 				and they're writing all their software to overlay programs into this sixteen bit address space rather than going to something that was you know modern fifteen <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX>
 				i don't know how much it costs them to maintain that outdated software but you'd think at some stage they'd get the get the idea that it it it pays to get to be more current
 			
 			
 				yeah i really wish there was some solution to this bureaucratic obesity that just seems to be prevalent in every sort of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> or administrative thing that gets so big
 			
 			
 				well the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> solution is to cut taxes
 				and i uh that may prevent it from getting worse but it doesn't solve it we haven't gotten our budget back into any better balance if it had not been for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">savings and loan</ENAMEX> debacle at least it would have remained the same as a result it's gotten worse but uh
 			
 			
 				um
 				not limiting taxes didn't hasn't stopped uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> from spending they just went ahead and spent it and now we've got this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">giant</ENAMEX> deficit on top of things
 			
 			
 				that's right that's right
 				um so i i i don't know i mean there there there's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only three</NUMEX> things you can do you you can you can cut programs you can raise taxes or you can cut waste and at the moment <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> don't want programs cut although
 			
 			
 				
 			
 			
 				uh i'm not sure that some of them shouldn't be looked at more carefully programs uh uh and i think of of programs you know when you when uh uh like the the um aid to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> with dependent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> that appears to create an incentive for unmarried <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> to have more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>
 				uh i'm a little concerned about that i'm a little concerned about cutting it out too because they might just end up aborting all of them
 			
 			
 				<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 			
 			
 				but uh there there there you know <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Governor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thompson</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wisconsin</ENAMEX> has an idea which is pay the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fathers</ENAMEX> of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> to marry the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> and at least that way you get you get the mother you know the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fathers</ENAMEX> to take up some of the some of
