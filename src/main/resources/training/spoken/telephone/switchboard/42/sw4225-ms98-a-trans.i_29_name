 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay well are you still there
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm here
 	
 	
 		yeah uh we got real good benefits where i'm at although they're becoming uh less and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">less every year</TIMEX> so that they're taking a little bit more away uh especially when it comes to health care benefits
 		do you <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> uh have full coverage where you're at
 	
 	
 		yeah well we do um it's
 		it's funny that uh that you mention that because health care benefits are really a big issue nowadays because of the skyrocketing costs
 		in general yeah our benefits uh
 		we we have a choice between an HMOs between various HMOs or just straight uh straight off major medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blue Cross Blue Shield</ENAMEX>
 		and um
 		seems like the main idea of insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> is to try as hard as possible to deny benefits and collect uh premiums as much as possible
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah yeah i i i agree uh you you pay a lot of money into them and then when you finally do have a claim they uh they really stick it to you they say that it doesn't meet their uh
 	
 	
 		they're
 	
 	
 		you know their their minimum amounts or something like that they've always got these uh these plans set up where they they've got a certain amount benchmarked for like a certain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX> or something but when you go to that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> it's always like <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">fifteen dollars</NUMEX> more than what they'll pay for
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh that's one thing that really bothers me down here they say that uh
 		the the primary or the the customary fee should be fifty dollars but then the most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> around here charge seventy <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> so it doesn't really keep up with what they
 		actually have so it's kind of a
 		they they kind of take from you a little bit there and uh the uh
 	
 	
 		yeah absolutely
 	
 	
 		other thing about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pratt</ENAMEX>'s benefits uh when i <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> came here <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five years ago</TIMEX> they really had like the best i thought that i'd ever had
 		and since then you know they've the staggering skyrocketing uh medical costs like you've said uh they've really had to cut back on what they give <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> because it was just taking too much money out of the company
 	
 	
 		yeah it's expensive uh it's very expensive for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> to uh to pay all the benefits out uh
 		if you want to talk for a second about non health benefits uh at my office we have free <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drinks</ENAMEX> free beverages
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		and uh that's really popular that's very uh a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> like that where we have uh all kinds of uh
 		uh well
 		here we call it pop i guess on the east coast you'd call it <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">soda</ENAMEX> and uh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">juices</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		oh you have soda
 	
 	
 		oh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> and uh uh spring <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> hot and cold and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">soups</ENAMEX> and that's
 	
 	
 		well that's pretty good benefit then
 	
 	
 		yeah it's very nice uh often if you're
 		just having trouble thinking and doing your work you can just get up and walk to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen</ENAMEX> and uh make yourself a cup of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> a fresh cup of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> herbal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> or whatever and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well i didn't i guess i never really thought about that as a benefit we we can get up and go to our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cafeteria</ENAMEX> and you know and pay to get something to drink but i guess i guess that is kind of a benefit just to have a place to go do that
 	
 	
 		yeah oh definitely it gives you a chance
 	
 	
 		yeah we we have a real nice <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cafeteria</ENAMEX> we can go to that anytime during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> and it's always it is always nice to go down there and get a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX> or a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> or a juice
 	
 	
 		sure absolutely and get your and give your mind a rest
 	
 	
 		yeah that that's that's always good
 		uh do you <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> have like a savings plan
 	
 	
 		uh well the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> offers a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">401K</TIMEX> but they don't contribute at all
 	
 	
 		uh our uh we we're really lucky in that respect our for every dollar we put in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pratt Whitney</ENAMEX>'ll match us sixty cents
 	
 	
 		so
 		so that is great
 	
 	
 		that that that that's real good and that's that's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> reason why i why i really like that
 	
 	
 		yeah that that that is a very nice benefit
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the things that we have lacking is the number of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">vacation days</TIMEX> we have uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">only two weeks</TIMEX> vacation a year
 	
 	
 		does it depend on how many <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> you've been there
 	
 	
 		no it's just across the board
 	
 	
 		wow that's really something uh at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pratt</ENAMEX> it's uh if you're there <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eight years</TIMEX> or less it's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks</TIMEX> and as soon as you get your <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eight year</TIMEX> in you get <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three weeks</TIMEX> and then when you get uh fifteen <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> you get another week so
 		you know a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> who's been out been out there for like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty five thirty years</TIMEX> get about uh you know <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five weeks</TIMEX> vacation paid a year
 	
 	
 		yeah well in the technology industry it's such a young industry that there aren't very many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that have been in it for a very long time so they don't have the same uh
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		scale although at other jobs i've had i've i've had <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three weeks vacation</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		ah
 	
 	
 		so uh so stripping down to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> was uh
 	
 	
 		how are your how how how important is that you know your benefits when you sound like you've uh done some job hopping you've had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> job then
 	
 	
 		uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> i've had three
 	
 	
 		oh okay with that how many how much time did you spend with each one
 	
 	
 		very short
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first the first</NUMEX> job with the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> were <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a half</NUMEX> each
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		and uh and after that i worked for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> i'm at where i plan to stay for a while
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">okay</ENAMEX> and and that's up in in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX> you said
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		that's right but you know in the the computer the computer industry is a little bit more liberal with benefits in general
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		i think than other industries um
 		in terms of uh flex <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> and just the you know the whole attitude of the work place
 	
 	
 		ah that's another that's another benefit i forgot to mention we have flex time
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you also have that
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		that's one of my favorite benefits uh
 		ever since i've been ever since i graduated from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eighty six</NUMEX>
 		every job i've had has always
