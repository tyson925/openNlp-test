 		well  he has my <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> doesn't like bows
 	
 	
 		for some reason
 		
  
 		well i don't blame him  i have a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		she's a a stray and um or was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> and she's i think a mixture between a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fox terrier</ENAMEX> and something else she's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about eight</NUMEX> pounds she's real little
 	
 	
 		oh she's uh yeah she's even smaller than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lacey Lacey</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about twelve pounds</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh okay yeah well she's really cute and sweet um  but speaking of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pets um</ENAMEX> my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> just got a little <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Labrador puppy</ENAMEX> that
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and i'm living with my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> and
 		and uh that's been interesting
 	
 	
 		i'll bet having having having your <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">puppy</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i'll bet that's cute
 	
 	
 		it is uh they've there's
 		learning how to play finely and and my <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX>'s establishing her <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">territory</ENAMEX> because she was there first you know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		oh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but he's so big even as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">puppy</ENAMEX> that um he gets pretty rough when playing and then she lets him know
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		that's not good no
 	
 	
 		that's not good well my my little <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> has a playmate from uh down the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> and we have play appointments and play <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> where
 	
 	
 		yeah uh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		oh huh
 		that's cute
 	
 	
 		where the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> trade <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> and play and romp just to keep each other company
 	
 	
 		well that's neat
 	
 	
 		yeah this one the her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">playmate</ENAMEX>'s a little um
 		uh poodle a little miniature poodle they're about the same size and they're both white but the little miniature <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">poodle</ENAMEX> is is skinny where my <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> is fat and fluffy  yeah
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		that's good yeah
 		more more roly-poly
 		well that's neat that you do that
 	
 	
 		yeah we think it's kind of fun it's better than watching TV to watch the little <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> play
 	
 	
 		huh
 		
  
 		oh definitely and it's better for them too emotionally
 	
 	
 		oh yeah yeah well i had that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		aquarium <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> and i got to where i wanted uh
 		take my <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> out and hold them and pet them  that wasn't going to work so i had to get something that i could hold and pet
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right
 		yeah that's a good idea  i have a bird too
 	
 	
 		yeah so
 		oh you do
 	
 	
 		yeah but i don't take her out she's kind of ornery
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		but i like to hear the you know noises she makes i have a parakeet
 	
 	
 		oh a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">parakeet</ENAMEX> does she talk to you
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		she doesn't uh talk verbally um
 		she doesn't
 		she doesn't know how to use words but i really like the sounds she makes the chirping and all that she sings and all that stuff
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh yeah
 		does she imitate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mocking birds</ENAMEX> yet
 	
 	
 		no i don't think she's heard a mocking bird
 	
 	
 		oh
 		that's the most fun when they hear the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mocking birds</ENAMEX> and then then begin to try to imitate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mocking birds</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mocking bird</ENAMEX> is imitating something else
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh well i don't i don't even know if she's heard one i know i put her outside when the days are nice
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um but i don't think we've i've heard of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mocking bird</ENAMEX> around my house
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		or i leave the radio on for her sometimes when i'm i go i go to school <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all day</TIMEX> so sometimes i just leave it on so she can have some kind of stimulation
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		you know i used to do that for my <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> too to give her some stimulation but she didn't seem to appreciate it she kind of likes the quiet
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 		yeah i i don't know if if and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> are real sensitive with their ears
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and yeah that
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		that would make sense that it might be comforting but
 	
 	
 		well i thought it would i thought it would be and i thought i was being a very good dog <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> to uh to do that for her but she didn't seem to appreciate it she likes the the quiet
 	
 	
 		i don't know
 		oh
 		yeah
 		the quiet
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		she also likes being able to hear everything that's going on in the neighborhood and i think the radio masked that
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh yeah
 		that's true that my <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> too she has to be near the window and look out
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right and look out
 	
 	
 		so she can know what's going on
 	
 	
 		and i had all these delusions about how my <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> was not going to go in certain <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> of the house
 	
 	
 		oh yeah that's a delusion
 	
 	
 		that's right it's just like you know i surely did  i surely did well what did you name your dog
 	
 	
 		so you learn quick
 		
 
 		yeah
 		Kitty
 	
 	
 		Kitty
 	
 	
 		yes because she acts like a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh how so
 	
 	
 		yeah well she's a real lap dog she likes to curl up in your lap
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and she'll um
 		she she just you know
 		when she she's real dainty
 		and she likes to jump
 	
 	
 		oh
