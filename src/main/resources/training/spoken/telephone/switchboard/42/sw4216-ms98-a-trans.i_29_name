 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay i guess we can just go ahead and start
 	
 	
 		sure enough
 	
 	
 		so what i did while they were uh a matter they i made some notes while they were calling around and they called quite a few different number before anybody answered
 	
 	
 		ooh
 	
 	
 		is uh some notes that i wrote down about our budget and that is uh the biggest problem that we have is that
 		uh my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> and i both work and i get a fixed amount and i'm paid once every <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks</TIMEX> and my pay check always the same
 	
 	
 		okay
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		she also get paid once every <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks</TIMEX> but her pay checks don't come at the same time mine do
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		and she doesn't get a fixed amount every everytime she gets paid
 	
 	
 		oh geez
 	
 	
 		and so trying to put together a budget from pay dates that are different and change all the time and where her amount change uh has been probably been one of the biggest budget problems that that we have
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		and uh so what we've done is kind of taken everything that we have had to pay out over a an extended period of time and then tried to average it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so that we could approximate how much each bill would be and then budget our pay checks accordingly base on the minimum amount that we would expect to receive
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		and that's that's been fairly effective
 	
 	
 		what happens if you get hit with some extraordinary expense
 	
 	
 		hum you mean like recently  right
 	
 	
 		well i mean you know  you know before you have a chance to say well geez we have <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of months</TIMEX> where we been low and put some off uh in the bank
 	
 	
 		exactly and that's uh that recently happen we had to have break jobs on both of our <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> and uh so then we end up doing a couple of things uh dipping into saving is one
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh</ENAMEX> ooh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh scrimping on other thing to uh get the extra money and then uh also we've got uh a an investment plan with a mutual fund
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and that's kind of like a savings account so between all of those varies <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> and uh that is obviously not a very good way of doing thing
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		so uh
 	
 	
 		well i mean you don't want to do it that way you rather just keep it all in the in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX> but uh  my gosh no i you know it's it's funny because when they came on they talked about
 	
 	
 		no
 		right
 	
 	
 		a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> budget and what not i stopped and thought to myself
 		geez we don't have a  or turns out that you know
 	
 	
 		don't even have one
 	
 	
 		uh my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> and i also work
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh she work for the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> and i work almost for the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> and but it's you know fixed income basically you know from pay check to pay check how much you're going to get
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and
 		uh i'm the only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> that pays any bills
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i mean she carries the check book but when it comes time  everybody who mails a bill like gas <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> and the telephone and all of that kind of stuff comes to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and one of them gets plopped in to my mailbox and then once a week or once every <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks</TIMEX> i'll sit down and and write checks
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		hum
 	
 	
 		well just recently we've we've found out that um
 		we've had her money direct deposited to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> account and my money direct deposited to another account
 	
 	
 		a different account huh um-hum
 	
 	
 		correct and we've been trying to live off my money which is not working out
 	
 	
 		right so you can the her money and then save it or right
 	
 	
 		exactly we've been trying to well basically we wanted to use her money just to pay the mortgage on the house
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know that was that way we wouldn't have to worry about the mortgage it would be covered and then we would have our living expenses on mine
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-hum
 	
 	
 		and it just hasn't work out you know and it i i've read these budget book and they say well you know you sit down and you figure out how much it's costing you to live and all that kind of stuff but
 	
 	
 		right
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh what i've notice is that it's extremely difficult for us to come up with a
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh it usually it it well cost it cost us you know uh <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">five hundred dollars</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a month</TIMEX> to live it doesn't work that  <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one month</TIMEX> it's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five hundred the next month</TIMEX> it's
 	
 	
 		a valuable uh budget yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		right um-hum
 	
 	
 		it's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a thousand</TIMEX> because you get the car insurance bill and then and then it goes down to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two hundred</NUMEX> because uh you're off on vacation or something or you know you you went traveling and and you didn't spend as much but then you come back and it goes up again and i mean it's uh that's been my problem
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		hum
 		we've got bill for example like the uh car insurance you mentioned that come and and this is the other problem when it comes to budgeting is that we have bills that don't come on a
 		uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</TIMEX> or or once every <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two week</TIMEX> bases like we get paid the the car insurance comes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every three months</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		so that means that uh uh everytime because we haven't uh disciplined ourselves where we can have a uh
 		certain amount set aside <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each month</TIMEX> for when that bill comes we end up
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		paying that whole bill <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every every three or four month</TIMEX> and then that cuts into everything else on it
 	
 	
 		um yeah
 		well i do have to say that uh when you know when we were real serious about budgeting the money and doing all of this my uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> sent me a book
 		and it was the book <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">uh Wealth Without Risk by Charles Given</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i do have to admit he had one suggestion in there that really
