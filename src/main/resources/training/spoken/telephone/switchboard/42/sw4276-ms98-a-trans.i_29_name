 
     		
 	
 		uh it was interesting i just read in the paper <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the other day</TIMEX> that they finally sent up the the uh former <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviets</ENAMEX> whatever you call them now
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		recently set up some relief for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> that's been up orbiting the mirror space <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX> for the last <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten months</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh right
 		
 
 		right i guess he had some culture shock and all the changes that took place while he was in space
 	
 	
 		boy i would think so that's incredible but could you imagine being in a in such an enclosed area for such a long period of time and totally isolated
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah i don't think
 		yeah it's it's pretty difficult to imagine i think that they don't have the same considerations for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">human being</ENAMEX> as we do in this country
 	
 	
 		no no i don't think so either i i was also kind of surprised that uh i don't maybe maybe there were technical uh limitations on what could be done but it it seemed like a perfect opportunity for the uh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> space program to
 		uh at least offer to get involved with them in in send up some sort of a relief or supplies or something and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		get some sort of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">union</ENAMEX> going
 	
 	
 		well i think uh maybe something like that may be in the works in the future trying to get some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">joint ventures</ENAMEX> between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> in terms of space exploration
 	
 	
 		yeah i hope so i'd like to see something like that
 	
 	
 		yeah i think uh you know the they have a lot of resources over there
 		and probably some cheaper labor and things where we could benefit by purchasing booster <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">rockets</ENAMEX> or maybe something on  that we can probably get from them cheaper than we can produce ourselves
 	
 	
 		right how do you feel as far as spending uh the tremendous amounts of money that need to be spent to keep the program going how do you feel about
 	
 	
 		well i don't know i think it's kind of hard to determine
 		uh the truth i mean you listen to some <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">sides</ENAMEX> of the story and they they don't they want to cut funding because they feel that the rewards of exploring space are very limited and then there's others who say we can learn a great deal
 		it's kind of hard to figure out what's true and what's not true
 	
 	
 		right yeah it really is it's uh
 		i'd certainly hate to see anything come to a grinding halt
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		although i guess uh certain logic could be applied to figure out how much spending it can do in any given <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year or period of years</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but i'd like to see you hear talk about this uh future space <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX> that may be built may serve as a a uh intermediate point between like a trip to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mars</ENAMEX> or something like that and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		seems like the next next big step that needs to be taken is interplanetary travel but that also seems so
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		um i don't know like the thing that some the figment of somebody's imagination
 	
 	
 		yeah definitely at this point it is i have a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> who works for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McDonald Douglas</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> and there's a prime contractor on the on that space station
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and um i know recently i their funding was at least guaranteed for another year
 	
 	
 		oh is that right
 	
 	
 		so they're going to continue
 		but i've also read a lot of bad things about it how they're talking about the value of the space <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX> is very limited in the amount of information that can be gathered is is minimal but
 		now now that's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> side of the story you know i'm sure if you ask someone from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McDonald Douglas</ENAMEX> they would tell you there's a lot more to be learned from it
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		i would think so i'd certainly think so and then you have the unfortunate mix between military politics and scientific exploration that
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		they're uh starting up star wars again evidently and that gets i don't know i think a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people lump</ENAMEX> that into the category of space travel even though it really has nothing to do with
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh scientific quest for knowledge it's
 		more uh paranoid
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		preventative thing for the military
 	
 	
 		well
 		i guess i some of the i mean i see a good
 		unmanned type space exploration sending uh satellites and or uh unmanned <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicles</ENAMEX> into orbit
 		or to other planets like <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Voyager</ENAMEX> and that sort of thing that seems to be pretty valuable and maybe more cost effective than trying to put human beings into space
 	
 	
 		definitely definitely in fact it seems uh that a a lot of those benefits were unexpected as far as
 		they had plans for these things and they sent them up <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX> and they never expected them to be still transmitting data back
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		that's incredible some of the pictures that have come back
 	
 	
 		yeah and and in a lot of ways it's improving the technology in terms of um
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> processing and and data transmission and trying to determine uh a picture from the information the very weak information they're getting back from these signals
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i agree i think that's definitely been worth while and like you said it's very cost effective and
 	
 	
 		and that's
 	
 	
 		probably yields as much information as as having somebody actually up there
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		although i sure wouldn't mind being the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> that's actually up there
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i think so
 	
 	
 		i don't know i don't know if it's quite as glamorous as it it seems like it would be
 	
 	
 		i i don't think it's glamorous i probably wouldn't enjoy it
 		all the time while it was happening but boy could you imagine looking back
