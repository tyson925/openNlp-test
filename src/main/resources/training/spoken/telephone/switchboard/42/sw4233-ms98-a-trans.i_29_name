 
     		
 	
 		okay well um let's see
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i understand you have more aggressive laws both in uh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> and in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oregon</ENAMEX> than than we down here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		well um yeah possibly um i'm not familiar with the laws in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> but we've got a citywide recycling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">program</ENAMEX> here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Seattle</ENAMEX> that's um
 		uh well well it's it's it's really amazing how many what's that
 	
 	
 		is it mandatory
 		is it mandatory
 	
 	
 		um  well they give you really good incentives  uh they pick up the recycled goods they give you they drop off containers at your house
 		so it's like it's like garbage collection um and you don't pay for it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh you same
 		uh basically at the same time they jack the garbage rates way up and and made it so you had to have city provided garbage cans that were of uniform size
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so we were amazed when we you know recycling's one of these things that we did kind of once and awhile but it was
 		uh you know something that i always put off because you had to haul the stuff and
 		and so i you know we didn't do it much but i was amazed at how much we reduced
 		the uh
 	
 	
 		the volume
 	
 	
 		the uh the volume of our trash
 	
 	
 		well <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ted</ENAMEX> down here we've had the uh containers available in you know various public places now since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid</TIMEX> seventies
 		but just in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last few days</TIMEX> there's been a proposal now to have uh
 		i believe it's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about six</NUMEX> times <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four to six</NUMEX> times a month they'll have a curb pick-up they'll give you containers
 		that are color coded so you can put cans and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glass</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		yeah it's like what we have yeah
 	
 	
 		but the difference is we have to pay for that
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about three</NUMEX> dollars and um <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty cents or so</TIMEX> or something like that i i was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about half</NUMEX> asleep when they were talking about it on the news but um
 		it is not going to go over too well as long as you have to pay a premium to participate i don't believe
 	
 	
 		yeah unless they structure the garbage rates so that uh you know it like works out to be cheaper
 	
 	
 		well the garbage rates here are high however as long as you bag it in plastic bags you can put out <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to ten</NUMEX> or twelve bags of of trash
 	
 	
 		oh my yeah they stopped that here they used to have it so that like you could get <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> can service and you could have huge cans you know that you furnished yourself
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and then you could put a bag out with each can and in fact if you put out more than that they'd pick it up anyway and now they've really tightened up <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">course</ENAMEX> there's some down sides to this too um
 		there's i don't i i don't know i hear that there's more of a problem with illegal dumping
 		after this when it you know after the rates went up
 	
 	
 		i suspect we're having some of that here too
 	
 	
 		and
 		yeah and then uh the other thing is what do they do with all the stuff they're just they're going to recycle they now have this huge glut of paper
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">um</ENAMEX> and it's difficult to find markets for it so the as a result the um price of
 		recycled paper has gone way down because you know there isn't there isn't enough demand for it all
 	
 	
 		yes
 		well we've had some what the same problem here i think newsprint's down something like um
 		under a dollar now per <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundred</NUMEX> weight
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh my
 	
 	
 		and it used to be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> and i think it even got above <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> point
 	
 	
 		yeah remember when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy scouts</ENAMEX> used to do paper drives and make money
 	
 	
 		yes yes
 		there used to be a recycling <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> where you'd take things in and you know they'd weigh it and pay you and they had paper and of course aluminum cans which are still very viable here
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and they had uh clear glass and colored glass
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		but i noticed recently that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">place</ENAMEX> has closed up
 		now my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX>'s really active active in some of this and she there's a place
 		oh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about eight</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> miles well i guess it's <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about six miles</NUMEX> from here where you can go and
 		uh few things they pay you for most things they just take
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but um
 		the movement here has not really progressed there's
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> is always slow on a lot of these things
 	
 	
 		yeah i understand until recently you could actually have an open container in your in your pick-up as you go down the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> there
 	
 	
 		um yeah that was kind of disastrous
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		of course we've had um major problems with them
 		driving while intoxicated and all that i think they're finally starting to get things a little a little more squared away
 		but they're a long way from that yet uh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> has always had a tradition of uh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> staying away from i mean laws the laws really leaving you alone unless you were clearly doing something
 	
 	
 		right uh it's it's out of the old west you know like you know
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		just recently there there now uh
 		well up until recently you could have a a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">rifle</ENAMEX> behind the seat of your pickup and all that kind of stuff and now they're starting to discourage you from that um
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and in there's parts of town here <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">now</TIMEX> where
