 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i run uh usually a couple of times a week um because i i'm at i'm a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rice University</ENAMEX> and so i can just sort of run a loop around the campus which is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about three</NUMEX> miles
 	
 	
 		good
 	
 	
 		and um that's sort of i guess it's probably the most common thing i do for exercise the other thing i do is um i try and play racquetball a couple of times <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a week</TIMEX> with um a friend
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill</ENAMEX> do you feel safe running across the campus
 	
 	
 		uh yeah actually if i do it uh certainly at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> i feel i mean sorry not at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> i feel perfectly safe at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> i usually do it with someone else
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		well the area immediately north of you and immediately west of you is not a very good area
 	
 	
 		well let's see um north is sort of the meandrous area which is not uh it's not too bad as far as crime goes i think i mean it's not really great
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		um south is the area that's really crime ridden that's sort of the south main area um
 	
 	
 		okay the south main yes okay i know what you're talking about
 	
 	
 		yeah so that that's not too great but the um i usually feel pretty safe around the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">campus</ENAMEX> itself uh the uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rice</ENAMEX> has their own police <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> and they're pretty aggressive about
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		well you've got pretty good fencing around your parameter parameter
 	
 	
 		no actually we don't we don't have fences it's just uh a tall <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">hedge</ENAMEX> so
 	
 	
 		okay well
 	
 	
 		but uh yeah it does  yeah at least it's a psychological barrier so
 	
 	
 		i know you have some separation because
 		my uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> went to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saint Thomas</ENAMEX> for uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> and
 		and uh we drove over and looked at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rice</ENAMEX> with the reason we thought there might some possibilities of of changing but
 		anyway uh i was very impressed with the campus
 	
 	
 		yeah it's really it's a pretty a beautiful campus especially considering it's in the middle of the ugly <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Houston</ENAMEX> but uh
 	
 	
 		yeah uh my exercise program i used i did run
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		uh for several reasons i now do mostly walking
 		uh one was that i had a knee injury i stepped in a
 		in a crack or a whole twisted my knee and it was very painful
 	
 	
 		hm
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and the other is i'm getting older now so it makes more sense to walk than it does to run
 	
 	
 		yeah i can um
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the reasons i run uh probably the biggest reason either run or play racquetball i mean either of them is um because if i don't get exercise i don't i don't sleep well and i just don't feel as good i just feel kind of yucky
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		well the emotional the emotional benefits of running are almost as good as the physical benefits i use it as stress relief
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah that too i mean uh the um
 		but the reason why i noticed you were talking about walking i i don't if i walk i'd have to walk like <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> miles i think to you know for it to really sort of get the same benefit as running if i run uh really hard
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		
  
 		um-hum that's true
 	
 	
 		and that that may just be that may just be me or you know whatever i'm sure i'm sure when i get older i'll probably i'll be more of a workout but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
  
 		well i walk forty <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> i walk forty <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> to fifty minutes
 	
 	
 		that's pretty good yeah
 	
 	
 		which is uh between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">three miles</NUMEX> at a at a fairly comfortable  uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		the last time i was doing an aggressive running program i was in graduate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> about um
 		oh it's i guess it's been <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten years ago</TIMEX> now but uh anyway i was doing i was running <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> miles
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a day</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> times <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a week</TIMEX> and that
 	
 	
 		wow that that that's a fair amount that's more than i do by a considerable amount
 	
 	
 		well that was that was because i was in graduate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> and i was doing about a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixty</TIMEX> hour week
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i had to do all this to play it you know to get things under control
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah no i understand that i mean i i sometimes you know feel like uh well one reason another another reason why i run rather than do something like walk is uh it takes a long time
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		because it's sort of the same work out but but yeah i can  i sort of you know am able to you know sleep better and and be more uh more alert um when i'm you know when i am awake if i if i exercise regularly so it really
 		it's kind of like an investment that pays off
 	
 	
 		i've never tried the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">handball</ENAMEX> do you find that helps you a lot
 	
 	
 		well i mean it's kind of it's it's you know it's good exercise especially when you get good at it because you the idea is to make the other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">player</ENAMEX> run to where he's not i mean you hit the ball it's kind of like tennis in that sense but you're not chasing always chasing after the ball um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yes i
 		yes
 	
 	
 		but uh the reason why i do like that a little bit better than running if i can find uh you know <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to play with because it's more it's more interesting i mean there's you know like a game aspect to it as well as just sort of the exercise
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		right
 		and as long as you keep moving you have the aerobic effect and i i'm sure if you have a  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> way good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">player</ENAMEX> you do keep running
 	
 	
 		
  
 		
  
 		yeah oh yeah
 		yeah yeah and it took a little it took a little while to to get good i mean the first you know i don't know <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two or three weeks</TIMEX> of playing uh you know to i didn't really get that great of work out but but it now i it's pretty good
 	
 	
 		um-hum i used to uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX> play <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">tennis</ENAMEX> but again uh as you get older <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">tennis</ENAMEX> is pretty rough on the knees i'm sure <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">handball</ENAMEX> would be also
 	
 	
 		
  
 		yeah i can i can understand knee problems because i've found i haven't had trouble with it <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> but in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">past years</TIMEX> when i've you know done only running and not racquetball um my
