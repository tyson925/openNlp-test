 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i'll start
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		um my feeling is that
 		you become a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politician</ENAMEX>
 		perhaps because um you think you're doing something noble perhaps because you're on a power trip but
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		what it all comes down to is you are doing this because you think
 		that your approach is better than what another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>'s approach is and you're looking to impose their will upon them your will upon them
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and um
 		so there's a fundamental problem
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">okay</ENAMEX> is that you you get into this to impose your will upon others
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		if you um
 		could do it you know if you didn't need to impose your will
 		then you could just do it by suggesting or writing articles in newspaper or what have you
 	
 	
 		right
 		right but it it does seem like a problem that the only people
 		who become <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who want to be president
 		and i don't really know if i want anybody who really wants to be president
 	
 	
 		well i think that the uh what do you call it uh you know those those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> who took pen to parchment <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple hundred years ago</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		had some good ideas and um one of the things that i think has gotten out of hand
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		is what the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> does
 		what kind of things they get involved it
 	
 	
 		that's possible
 	
 	
 		um there was a time when
 		the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> wouldn't wouldn't think of telling you what you could eat or smoke
 		um there was a time when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> wouldn't think of um
 		imposing heavy taxes on transportations on on your means of transportation to uh build <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">uh roads</ENAMEX> where they wanted them
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		and i think those those are the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of things that come to mind i think that um
 		if what the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> sets out to do
 		is fairly limited
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		then the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who decide they want to be <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> can't get into a whole lot of trouble
 	
 	
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		um it's only when you try to run every aspect of life from cradle to grave that when a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politician</ENAMEX> runs amok they can do serious damage
 	
 	
 		that's an interesting point so you're you're taking sort of a libertarian view here
 	
 	
 		oh absolutely um
 		you know i think that uh we've gotten ourself into a lot of trouble um i think that well
 		i think that getting ourselves out of it is going to be painful
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um i hope it happens peacefully
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		because it will happen
 	
 	
 		now what sort of uh what sort of which part which sort of trouble are you speaking of
 	
 	
 		well we're in a situation right now where um uh the comment  even in a situation right now where um
 		large portions of your life are controlled by forces that aren't particularly interested in your welfare and um
 	
 	
 		what sort of control
 	
 	
 		the quality of life is deteriorating uh
 	
 	
 		what control what sort of controls are you thinking of
 	
 	
 		well take well taking half your income is uh a pretty good one uh not being permitted to defend yourself is another one um
 	
 	
 		or what sort of areas you know life
 		
 
 		um
 	
 	
 		i don't know what the laws are like in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> in in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> but in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> um if you wake up <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one night</TIMEX> and go down stairs and see a fellow about to climb out the window with your TV set
 		you cannot use deadly force against them
 	
 	
 		well then the question is so he's climbing out the window
 	
 	
 		with your TV set yeah
 	
 	
 		with your TV set and you feel that a fitting punishment for television theft is death
 	
 	
 		um
 		um well there's an interesting issue there uh
 		let's suppose someone breaks the window of your <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> and steals your radio
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		all right um
 		we look at this and we say okay fine it's
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">hundred dollars</NUMEX> damage just picking a number off the top of my head
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		let's suppose you make <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five bucks an hour uh thirty bucks an hour</TIMEX> to make the math easy
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		theoretically <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">ten working hours</TIMEX> of your life have just vanished
 	
 	
 		oh sure
 	
 	
 		and and and don't quote on the uh example of insurance because that  means those <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">ten working hours</TIMEX> of someone else's life got vanished
 	
 	
 		right and you're pay for it eventually
 	
 	
 		yeah one way or another um so when material objects are destroyed
 		you know it's it's it's it's you you you it's it's a um
 		how can i better say it you know when a material object is destroyed it is a portion of one's life that's consumed if you look at it that way
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know it's not as cut and dry and radical as uh
 		you know as um
 		when someone is killed in cold <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> but uh there is a very very subtle effect there and i think one of the problems we have with law today is that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		when somebody runs out and passes a law
 		be it increase in taxes be it what have you generally speaking
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um you're not creating anything
 		you're just moving stuff from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> place to another
 		okay you're moving
 		some kind of uh you know if if you um very strongly reinforce the particular enforce enforce enforce a particular um
 		civil right um one of the example that comes to mind is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miranda</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		okay um which i think is a good thing
 		um but
