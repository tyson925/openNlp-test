 
     		
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		like i say i'm a i'm a uh a sort of an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">addict</ENAMEX> for
 		uh current events and news so i read the paper almost everyday and
 		um
 		i also
 		generally watch one of the national news casts
 	
 	
 		yeah i keep up with most of my stuff either by the news i don't get to read the paper everyday because i just don't have enough time but i read it on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sundays</TIMEX> and then i always listen to the like <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">six o'clock or ten o'clock</TIMEX> news and then listen to the radio
 	
 	
 		uh my main problem is that um i i like to follow the national news
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so i'm i'm really not very happy with local news <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cast</ENAMEX> and i'm uh i don't like the local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> paper very much either
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		
 
 		especially since we don't have a choice anymore since <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> lost its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> paper that i
 	
 	
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		um um i usually read the front page and then the editorial page and uh i'm finding that i spend less and less time on the editorial page because the selection is so bad
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		what about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA Today</ENAMEX> do you read that one
 	
 	
 		no uh i used to
 	
 	
 		nope
 	
 	
 		uh uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> is my favorite <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX> that's what i grew up with but uh i don't spend the money on it because i know i only get to spend <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five or ten minutes</TIMEX> on it and have to
 	
 	
 		it's not worth it
 	
 	
 		uh let it pile up
 	
 	
 		i like um <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA Today</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		because i mean it's not real thick but it gets most of the stuff in there that's current and going on
 	
 	
 		does it have editorial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">writers</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um yeah
 	
 	
 		who are some of them
 	
 	
 		now that got got me i mean i don't read it everyday like whenever we're on vacation or whenever i go on vacation or whatever i i get to keep up with it but that's like what once or twice a year
 	
 	
 		can you
 		i wonder if they use their uh the same ones all the time or if they just grab uh the
 		best of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Post</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> and they probably have a few syndicated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">columnists</ENAMEX> that they rotate
 	
 	
 		i think well i mean i don't know you know i really have never paid that much attention to that
 	
 	
 		that's that's what the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dallas Morning News</ENAMEX> does and they they
 		they seem to select
 		select them kind of irregularly and i um
 		i don't think they do a very good job myself
 	
 	
 		yeah do you read the paper everyday
 	
 	
 		pretty much i guess i like i said i read the headlines and then i read the editorial page and then i check the uh local news that's the only thing i really rely on the paper for is the local news
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but um i i'm finding that
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McNeal Lehrer</ENAMEX>
 		uh news hour is the TV program that i
 		i like to watch the most they because they they don't give you these <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">seconds</TIMEX> short shots of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty</TIMEX> different stories they usually spend <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about fifteen minutes or ten minutes</TIMEX> on the story
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		now um when does that come on
 	
 	
 		<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">ten o'clock</TIMEX> well it's actually it's on a couple of times it's on channel <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> at
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> i think and it's on channel thirteen at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">uh ten o'clock</TIMEX> usually
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so i try to watch that from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eleven</NUMEX> unless
 		unless something else is going on
 	
 	
 		the radio station that i listen to <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">in the morning</TIMEX> i mean they're they're real good about going over like what's going and i mean they talk about it like some of this like the major events that are going on
 	
 	
 		you ever listen to the public radio station
 	
 	
 		um no no well i mean i may've just flipped through it why
 	
 	
 		KERA
 		they're quite yeah
 		they're quite good uh yeah i like them very much
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		that's that's what i tune to regularly um
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KRLD</ENAMEX> if i need to know what the traffic's like
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		no the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eagle</ENAMEX> usually i mean they'll can tell you pretty much they go over the stuff they have a newscaster on there and they go i mean it's short and sweet but i mean they keep you up to date on stuff
 	
 	
 		you spend a lot of time driving
 	
 	
 		yeah well yeah well i mean i always listen to the radio or the TV whenever i'm getting ready in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i'm always listening to the news um when i drive but i don't drive i mean i my commute is <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">only about five minutes</TIMEX> so i
 		i don't have to uh spend a lot of time in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> if i did i guess i would rely more on the radio more than i do on the TV
 	
 	
 		see you have a shorter commute so that's why you get to stay home and read the paper in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		me i just have to rely on the TV or the um the newspaper i mean the or the
 	
 	
 		right
 		right yeah
 	
 	
 		radio station
 	
 	
 		yeah i
 		i find that
 		most of the TV coverage is too short and superficial so that's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one one</NUMEX> reason you have to have a newspaper so you can read something in depth
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well i used to work i worked for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six and a half years</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		they did where
 	
 	
 		uh in well in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nacogdoches Texas</ENAMEX> which is real small town
 	
 	
 		oh
 		uh-huh i know where it is yeah uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and oh really well um it was family owned and everything so we didn't like the the way a lot of the stuff was run there
 	
 	
 		was it a weekly
 	
 	
 		daily um-hum
 	
 	
 		daily oh i wouldn't think a size <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> that size would have a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> newspaper
 	
 	
 		yep
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		but they got bought out by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cox</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so now a lot of things have changed or whatever
 	
 	
 		is it still a daily
 	
 	
 		yep
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		is that where you grew up
 	
 	
 		yes actually
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		well that's
 		
 
 		surprising surprising there was a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a daily</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX> at a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> that small
 	
 	
 		yeah like i said it was family owned and they pretty much i mean they were in the  i mean well they put in there what they published what they wanted to publish and stuff they didn't want to publish
 	
 	
 		yeah
