 
     		
 	
 		talk about home repairing i understand
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		did have you had any recent experience
 	
 	
 		well i'm not a home <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owner</ENAMEX> but i consider myself to be pretty handy uh
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 		well i'm sure you are mean usually are
 	
 	
 		but i don't
 		i don't uh i don't uh
 		it's kind of uh it's kind of a hard thing to to talk about having a limited experience base i mean i fix things around here rather than uh rather than bother a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">landlord</ENAMEX> with it i'll you know repair a sink or um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		actually i fixed our <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> bed that was pretty handy but  but how about you
 	
 	
 		that's right
 		well i had an experience uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this summer</TIMEX> as a matter <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this past summer</TIMEX> hm not this and what happened  was that my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">closet</ENAMEX> rod fell down
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i went into the closet
 		and this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">closet</ENAMEX> is probably <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">fifteen feet</NUMEX> long
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and all my clothes were on the floor and i said oh my word  oh yes they're very heavy
 	
 	
 		oh boy
 		and they're heavy too you don't think about how heavy it is
 	
 	
 		and um
 		so i i thought now because i'm alone and i said now who am i going to get to do this because i sure don't i wouldn't
 		i know one end of the hammer from the other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> but that's about it i wouldn't know how to address a nail properly at all
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so i scoured the little paper that we get in the neighborhood and i found uh
 		uh a handyman and he said that he was an ex-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> and i thought well he sounds like the kind of caliber that i would not be too leery of and i called him and
 		he did a marvelous job and i and i got to know him pretty well and i said uh he said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Catherine</ENAMEX> he says if you
 		this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> will fall down but these closet these close rods will not fall down  he says that's how good they're in there he says i guarantee this for life
 	
 	
 		hm yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so that really pleased me and he did a marvelous he did a fantastic job and he also uh replaced my door in my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garage</ENAMEX> uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i had been robbed uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year before</TIMEX> and um
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		they wanted to charge me <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">six hundred dollars</NUMEX> to replace the side door and i thought no you're not i'm not paying <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">six hundred dollars</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six hundred</NUMEX> dollars
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> money
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> money
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ken</ENAMEX> did it for me for like <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two hundred</NUMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> dollars
 		and he gave and he gave me a solid core door and
 		you know i just said i knew that i would find somebody that would do this at a price that was realistic
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six hundred</NUMEX> dollars for one single side door that's well he said well that's including labor and i thought okay <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charlie</ENAMEX> i said that sounds silly
 	
 	
 		hm boy
 	
 	
 		very extreme
 	
 	
 		yeah that was a that was a good deal you got
 	
 	
 		yeah so
 	
 	
 		actually it was a really bad deal that they they tried to give you i guess
 	
 	
 		yes it was well see they thought that they could prey on my uh recent loss that i would be in a panic to have this door fixed because that was the door that the intruders
 		broke through but but the insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> had made it so that nobody could get in because they put <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> by fours over it and nailed it shut
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		yeah that's kind of yeah that would
 	
 	
 		and uh so i mean
 		if they wanted to get in they would have had to use a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mac truck</ENAMEX> to get through the bars
 	
 	
 		and hey i'm sure someone probably if they if they were interested they would have you know that
 	
 	
 		yeah well they you know the insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adjuster</ENAMEX> said if if they are bent on getting your <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> they'll they'll they'll plow through your brick
 	
 	
 		yep they won't stop it
 	
 	
 		uh he said there's not anything that's going to stop them if they're determined
 	
 	
 		the
 		they'll stop at nothing but i'm glad you got your home fixed that's that's important i i put up uh closet <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">organizers</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one year</TIMEX> and uh
 		uh i don't know if you're familiar with them up here they call them the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> closets they're wire uh uh basically they subdivide your closets into all sorts of little nooks and crannies
 	
 	
 		oh i see they organize them oh okay
 	
 	
 		yeah and shelves and so instead of having just a little one rod you have racks and shelves and stuff and you have uh rods but those are bi-level rods there's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sets upper and lower then sort of doubles the hanging space then
 	
 	
 		sure how how do you like that
 	
 	
 		oh they're great
 	
 	
 		oh wonderful
 	
 	
 		they're great and um you know they're
 	
 	
 		wonderful
 		so you can utilize all of your <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">closet space</ENAMEX> by having those
 	
 	
 		oh yeah oh yeah and instead of having shoes or whatever on the floor and and things like that in your <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">closet</ENAMEX> they have little shelves on the side that you can
 	
 	
 		that's wonderful
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you can still stack things on they have they have all sorts and uh you know they sell them in our the local home <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> here and uh i'm sure that you can pick them up down there but it's a really uh the way they put them together it's really not hard at all to put them
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		put them in it takes <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about an afternoon</TIMEX> it was a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> you know and uh you lay it out and they give you little things that you mark uh on your wall tells you how to
