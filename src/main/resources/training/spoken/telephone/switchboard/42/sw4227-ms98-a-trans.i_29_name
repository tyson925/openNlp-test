 		yeah they get along
 	
 	
 		yeah oh yeah they get along real good oh the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> was brought up with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> so he doesn't really bother the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		well that's good
 	
 	
 		well now the little kitten picks on him all the time
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yep
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well how old is the dog
 	
 	
 		uh let's see uh about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven eight years old</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		goodness <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mine</ENAMEX>'s only i guess three
 	
 	
 		and
 		and our <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">only about two years old</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		well um what made you get a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		well uh we both we've had <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> before you know before we even got married so
 		i kind of like <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> and she likes dogs so  yep
 	
 	
 		so you compromised
 	
 	
 		so we've had them oh at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time we had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		goodness
 	
 	
 		but
 	
 	
 		well i got my <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog little dog</ENAMEX> to keep me <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> and now i'm hardly ever at home
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		so now it's like whenever you come in he's all over you
 	
 	
 		oh yeah well ours does that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> when we get it
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yep
 	
 	
 		yeah it's like a new face
 	
 	
 		yep
 		uh
 	
 	
 		something i guess like just something new and different
 	
 	
 		oh yeah he he's pretty he's real friendly
 	
 	
 		well that's good
 	
 	
 		but but when somebody knocks at the door he's his barks
 		is real uh you know like he's a real bad dog
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		when you come in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and he
 		he'd probably show the burglars where everything was at
 	
 	
 		thinks i think that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brian</ENAMEX> would probably do the same thing
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		oh
 	
 	
 		well i've heard that <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">um pets</ENAMEX> are like to to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that are sick or to older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that they're have like calming effects on them
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i've heard that too
 	
 	
 		especially i guess if they have like high blood pressure or
 		um like heart conditions it just kind of helps to have a little or a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> or a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> or something around just to lavish the attention on it kind of calms them
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah i know i think it helps them too when they take them out for walks and stuff especially dogs you know plus they're uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX>'s a good
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		good uh way to protect your <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX> too when you're gone
 	
 	
 		uh that's true
 	
 	
 		you know like i said he barks a lot when somebody rings knocks on the door or rings the doorbell so it kind of keeps <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> away
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		they think twice about breaking in
 		
  
 	
 	
 		um
 		trying there's something i was going to tell you and i forgot just totally went out the window
 	
 	
 		uh
 		but our little our little <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">kitty</ENAMEX> he she uses uh
 		she's pretty cute little the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> got her when
 		she she was a stray and uh it bit her and so she had to bring it home with her to see if she got rabies or anything
 	
 	
 		and then y'all decided to keep it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">yep</ENAMEX> so
 	
 	
 		isn't that funny how there's always a story behind something
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well that's basically how she got the dog too
 	
 	
 		oh
 		well do you have names that are appropriate with more or less how you found them or how you got them or anything or
 	
 	
 		well well not really
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		
 
 		we uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX>'s name is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morgan</ENAMEX>
 		and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>'s name is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oscar Anne</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oscar Anne</ENAMEX> well that's a new one
 	
 	
 		yeah well well see at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> they thought that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> was a a boy
 		so they called her <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oscar</ENAMEX> until the found out she was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> so they just called her <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oscar Anne</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh i see
 	
 	
 		
 
 		so that's
 		uh that's the name there and uh how we got the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> was we were stationed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX> and
 		she went to some we had a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> and she took it to <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog obedience</ENAMEX> school
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmer</ENAMEX> was gonna kill these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">puppies</ENAMEX> they had and
 		she kind of said well i'll kind of i'll take one of them off your hands
 		
 
 		and that's how we got Morgan
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lord</ENAMEX> did you have a problem naming um coming up with names for them
 	
 	
 		i think uh well i didn't really come up with the name she did so
 	
 	
 		it took me like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three weeks</TIMEX> to name <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mine</ENAMEX> because i kept saying well i wan t to find a name that fits
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i actually had for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of days</TIMEX> had started calling
