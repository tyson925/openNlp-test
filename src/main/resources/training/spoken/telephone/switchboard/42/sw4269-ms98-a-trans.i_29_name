 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		so do you do you happen to work for some uh computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> up there in
 	
 	
 		no uh actually well yeah i do i i work for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lockheed</ENAMEX> and uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah that's why you have a computer at home
 	
 	
 		no actually i it's like i i have a computer i <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> when i went to grad school i uh i realized that having a computer would be
 		like that it was going to make my life a lot easier
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh</ENAMEX> does it make a lot easier
 	
 	
 		so
 		sure did uh i mean i you you i don't think i don't know anybody that can get through school without a computer at this point in time
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		especially like um
 		it well just for like producing for like for producing papers and things like that
 		um it it was you know it it was like indispensable nobody nobody on the typewriter anymore
 		yeah it's a sort of thing where with the kind of support you can get from software to for for writing things like that
 		uh i writing  using a using
 		using a typewriter was sort of like you know uh lighting a fire by like rubbing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sticks together you know instead of using your Bic lighter
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah why'd you choose uh have you always had a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mac</ENAMEX> or why'd you choose a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mac</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		well actually uh i just go with the times and and actually
 		and to human factors and i uh i you know i was into when i was in college i had a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commodore</ENAMEX> sixty <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> went to college
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh oh at at work they had <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> PCs and compatibles and i worked for them for with them for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year few years</TIMEX> but i didn't have a need to have have one at home
 		because of  as a poor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">graduate student</ENAMEX> i didn't have money and also because uh there're plenty of them around at work but then came the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macintosh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and it they came out with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mac</ENAMEX> 2 which is a whole lot more useful than any other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macintosh</ENAMEX> that that had come out and they also came out with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hypercard</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i needed to use that for my dissertation work
 	
 	
 		oh really you did your dissertation with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hypercard</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah so i didn't i had to uh use uh i didn't have access to computers at work very easily everyone was wanting to use it so i bought my own and that's where i started and i bought subsequently after that uh
 		well uh replacement ones
 	
 	
 		you're going to tell me you have a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Quadra</ENAMEX> right now right
 	
 	
 		yeah oh no no no no i've had this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SE</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> for for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">number of years now couple years</TIMEX> at least
 	
 	
 		
  
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three years</TIMEX> almost now
 		uh
 	
 	
 		i it you know it's like when when i when i decided to like buy a buy a computer
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		i one of the things that like that i i came down to is is that
 		i i chose my computer on basis of uh of i i don't know i guess at work we would call it like you know <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">MIPS</NUMEX> per dollar or something like that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and it turned
 		i i did a careful analysis i went for my MBA
 		
 
 		anyway i did a careful analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">of like of of the</ENAMEX> of what i could get for how much i was going to spend
 		and
 		it's like it turned out that that that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macs</ENAMEX> were almost twice as expensive like per feature than PCs were
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and that was like why that was why i chose i i ended up chose chose
 		even though it's like i evaluated <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Macs</ENAMEX> as being the superior
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> qualitatively better
 		in terms of like you know uh what what they could do and like ease of use and things like that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		when i started like uh investigating the cost of software that's when i decided that a PC was like really was more cost effective even though it was the inferior product
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		well as you know getting we're getting away from that but that's why you have one at home because it was cost effective and you got your work done basically um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it helped me get my work done because uh it's you know i'm i'm into human computer interaction and human and computer interfaces it was one of the better ones and so
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah no i i i i agree it it is it is it is is superior in that in that case
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but
 		i you know one of the things that i i i think about in terms of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">of</NUMEX> of like of computers is um
 		it it
 		i think that  i don't know it
