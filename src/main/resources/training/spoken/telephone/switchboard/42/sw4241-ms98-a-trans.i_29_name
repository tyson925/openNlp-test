 
     		
 	
 		okay um
 	
 	
 		
  
 		
  
 	
 	
 		i guess i'm not real familiar with recycling because i've been in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty years</TIMEX> so uh
 	
 	
 		oh you're an environmental <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineer</ENAMEX>'s dream
 	
 	
 		uh
 		right so uh actually the first my first encounter with it was at the the place we were originally renting uh which was a small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX> near here and they
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		they gave each household one of these plastic
 		uh bins or whatever to put our our stuff in
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh then when we moved into the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">townhouse</ENAMEX> where we are now
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		there there again there was no recycling program and now there is
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		and uh so we
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		we're recycling uh all the cans the glass bottles all the plastic and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX> which
 	
 	
 		that's great i really feel like uh community sponsorship is going to be one of the keys to uh recycling success
 	
 	
 		
  
 		
  
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		
  
 	
 	
 		um i know here we have in my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> now we're i'm in unincorporated i'm in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">county</ENAMEX> by i'm unincorporated
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh within a certain city limits there's there's more uh
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		uh more i i i just want to say better programs here we have uh trash pickup twice <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a week</TIMEX> and on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first day</TIMEX> they'll pickup aluminum cans and on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> they'll pick up newspapers
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		
  
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		
  
 		hm
 	
 	
 		and um i think those are you know the kind of the core
 	
 	
 		
  
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crops</ENAMEX> if you will just to because they're the most uh lucrative i think and the most uh technologically feasible to recycle
 	
 	
 		
  
 		uh
 		
  
 		right
 		ours our regular trash <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pickups</ENAMEX> are also twice <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a week</TIMEX> but then the recycling pick up is totally separate and that's on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		
  
 		oh are is is your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> recycling sponsored by your local government
 	
 	
 		so uh
 		
  
 		um-hum yeah it's just a small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> and it's uh it's locally sponsored
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		i don't know what they do with it uh that always
 		uh
 		uh interested me as to where it goes and what they do with it to to process it but uh
 	
 	
 		yeah there're a lot of different ways to recycle you can um especially with the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plastics</ENAMEX> you can melt them down and reform them or you can actually recycle them and it depends on whether they segregate the different types of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plastics</ENAMEX> there're <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> main types
 	
 	
 		
  
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		
  
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hm</ENAMEX> now i i kind of came up with an idea as well on my own in that
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		i think part of the recycling responsibility falls
 		uh not only with the local or county <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> but with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> as well
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		because uh the individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> is capable of recycling things that never have to be delivered to somebody else to to be recycled
 	
 	
 		
  
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		and so i've kind of looked for because i'm interested in gardening which is an ideal uh vehicle for recycling i've looked for those things that i can recycle
 	
 	
 		
  
 		oh
 		
  
 	
 	
 		that i can use with my uh organic gardening that uh i like to do yeah and so what for example  what i do is uh
 	
 	
 		oh you do organic gardening
 		
  
 	
 	
 		recycle the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">grass clippings</ENAMEX> and all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">leaves</ENAMEX> that uh not only that i rake but uh that all my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> rake up for me  it's uh
 	
 	
 		oh how wonderful you're doing so well
 	
 	
 		it's neat that they uh they will rake it up for me off of their own <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">yards</ENAMEX> bag it for me and put it on the curb for my easy collection  and uh
 	
 	
 		
  
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		
  
 		right
 		
  
 	
 	
 		so then i just uh get as much as i need
 		which sometimes embarrasses my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>  she says please don't pickup their grass clippings and i uh take it into the backyard or in this case wherever i can and compost it
 	
 	
 		
  
 		
  
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		see and then i can recycle that right into the garden and uh i
 	
 	
 		
  
 		yeah that's wonderful i'd love i'm i have
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		tried not too diligently to get involved with that organic gardening composting i have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> and they would eat every bit of compost i'd put out there and i fenced it off with chicken wire <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about two or three</NUMEX> feet high
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		
  
 		hm
 		
  
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and they'd jump over the wire just to eat the little <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">egg shells</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">potato peels</ENAMEX> and just whatever they could put their little jaws on it was awful
 	
 	
 		
  
 		really
 		so you you have <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> that are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vegetarians huh gee</ENAMEX> that's odd
 	
 	
 		
  
 		yeah <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people people</ENAMEX> say it's just part of my Karma i'm not a complete vegetarian as a matter of fact i've got some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">corn beef</ENAMEX> on the stove right now but i uh
 	
 	
 		
  
 		hm
 		
  
 		oh
 		
  
 	
 	
 		don't eat much <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meat</ENAMEX> or as much as i used to but my <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> since i've been eating more produce
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		
  
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		eat more produce anyway
 	
 	
 		
  
 		they they do to huh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		well that's odd i'd never heard of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> eating
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">uh</ENAMEX> vegetable leftovers or anything like that huh because one of the things that they say about compost uh if you make it from grass and leaves and
 	
 	
 		yeah they'll
 		yeah
 		
  
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruits</ENAMEX> and vegetable leftovers or scra pses that uh it does not attract animals
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		um because there's no <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meat</ENAMEX> in it or anything or <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> or anything like that
 	
 	
 		
  
 		well yeah
 	
 	
 		that's interesting that you have <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> that are attracted to compost well they guess they'll be healthy dogs
 	
 	
 		
  
 		yeah
 		yeah  well with my luck they'll live forever huh
 	
 	
 		right so i uh i do that and then the other thing that i try and do along the same lines is uh because i like to start my own seedlings
 	

 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		i look at what
 		i can do with the some of the plastic containers that we have
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		that i can use in the gardening
