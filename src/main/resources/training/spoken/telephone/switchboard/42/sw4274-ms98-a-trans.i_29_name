 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		think of drug testing
 	
 	
 		well i'm one of those grey haired old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> that doesn't think that there's anything wrong with it how about you
 	
 	
 		i don't know i i see it as as a bit of a privacy issues why do you need to tell the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> any information i can definitely see it
 		in the case where there's a problem that you know the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>'s performance is bad or where they have uh you know they suspect something wrong with the person
 		but in a case where there's no problem and nothing suspected what does the random testing do
 		especially since they're only testing for certain things they're not testing for other things uh that could be impairing your ability to perform the job
 	
 	
 		well that that's an interesting question
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		from from the stand point of
 		to me uh a general uh uh
 		you know a a general question is
 		all all <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substances</ENAMEX> the particular question in my mind is uh it's very easy
 		to go from
 		from uh how should i say it uh
 	
 	
 		recreational use
 	
 	
 		well let me put it this way from very minor use
 		to uh to very significant use in a short time
 	
 	
 		yes that's true of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lots</ENAMEX> and lots of things
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		yes <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> is uh one of the most and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		when i was growing up uh
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		i i was
 		lucky enough to belong to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> that was
 		where we didn't have to say well dad why how should i say this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> and and uh tobacco and all those <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substances</ENAMEX> were off limits and at the time i i kind of thought well this is a strict <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		then as i grew older uh in fact one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> told me said you were kind of lucky
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		the stuff that we're all trying to quit right now uh smoking and and uh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX> and things like that are things that you never had to that you don't have to quit
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
  
 	
 	
 		uh but i i'm i'm not talking about
 		you know about moral <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> here as much as i am just talking about
 	
 	
 		right
 		
  
 	
 	
 		um
 		most of the things that that parents
 		in how should i say it the big issue was
 		why can't i do this if you do that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> i mean you come home and have your martini right
 	
 	
 		um-hum yes it's definitely the do as i say not as i do question
 	
 	
 		yeah that was a definite opening for the for the you do your thing and i'll do mine
 		um in my particular case i think that all of those or like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> is a is a severe problem
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it's happens to be traditionally
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> and
 		uh how should i say it it has to be traditionally accepted that the drug testing in my mind is is really to spot the extreme user
 		and if they have to spot the occasional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> in the process and and when i say extreme i mean they can you can go from
 		from little or nothing to to extreme very quickly in this game i've been told
 	
 	
 		yeah now i think that's more related to other stresses outside
 		you know if you get into a period where you're very very stressed on your job or very very stressed in your life then you're going to be you know if you have the predisposition then you can turn and your habit goes up and that's very true of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">alcoholism</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh well yes and also the others too i mean i'm
 	
 	
 		
  
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i'm not uh
 		uh i guess
 		the way i'm approaching this is it's tough to defend <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of the playing field if you don't defend the whole playing field you know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh the playing field in in this case is uh some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are trying to say well it's just uh marijuana or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocaine</ENAMEX> or whatever
 	
 	
 		
  
 		right
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> and i think that's a tough a tough proposition it always has been and and it gave a lot of my
 		uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> fits
 	
 	
 		yeah but you know it it i i think there's a broader issue there is does a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> have a right to know something about a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> that doesn't effect their job performance
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> and i you know that doesn't effect your job performance i think as a as a real tough uh
 		issue and if i were if i were convinced i mean you know you and i are just talking here and
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		how how should i say it this is
 		talk for pay so i'm not trying to attack you personally but but uh
 		uh the problem is that i think it does effect performance and and
 		you can go from a from a
 		from no <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX> at all in your life to being significantly stressed uh in a day
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		right and when the
 	
 	
 		uh i i i think that's to a large extent most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> you know let let's take <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> since that seems to be the more public knowledge and more studied of these type of things
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um i think there's more of a predisposition to it that a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> when they get stressed out you and i
