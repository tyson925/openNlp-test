 
     		
 	
 		how do you fill about <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> testing
 	
 	
 		
 
 		will i'm sorry i have i had mixed fillings about it um
 		at originally i thought all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> i'm all for it totally then you know and then um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh after i got to thinking about it after it's been around a while now i think well it's there's
 		you know uh
 		maybe it not quite should not be quite as a as wide spread as i as i use to think it should be you know maybe in certain depends on the job really you know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i happen to work uh in a medical profession and uh i work at a hospital and i think that's a good one that that it should be required at you know i myself wouldn't mind taking it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but i do also believe there are times when um you you can come out on the bad end of the stick you know uh because of it
 	
 	
 		well yeah i'm i'm more of the uh
 		i'm kind of more against it than i am for it i i think that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> i think <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> should more be they should be <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> on you know their performance and i
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		sure
 	
 	
 		i guess it kind of seems to me that's it kind of a
 		you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		the positive you the test type thing that you know <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> should pay attention to how there <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> are you know the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supervisors</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		that's right that's right and then
 	
 	
 		should keep an eye on them i i think that should be the the deciding factor in um-hum
 	
 	
 		yeah well i agree with that to i mean if you can if there is a reason you might think you need to check them maybe so but um if there doing good performance if i had a good record yeah that's a good point you know why why should you
 	
 	
 		
  
 		and
 		it also kind of i mean
 	
 	
 		you know
 	
 	
 		i don't know it it kind of frighten me in in one way because it it seems like it's um
 		it's kind of a personal you know your
 	
 	
 		yeah sure
 	
 	
 		checking you know your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> and everything and if if they can if they can you know do a do a drug test you know they can
 	
 	
 		that's right that's right and um
 		really really where what's the next step you know yeah and uh cause myself i drink and uh you i'm i'm sure that you know when will they
 	
 	
 		you you know get get away with testing other things yeah exactly
 		yeah
 		i mean that's a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> as well it's just
 	
 	
 		that's true that's true and what's what's really the difference there alcohol is worst than a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> that they might uh consider illegal you know  and um but they um uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		that's true
 		
  
 	
 	
 		i mean i know in alcohol i mean if you if you drink <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the night</TIMEX> before and what if you have the test <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next day</TIMEX> maybe that will be the next step is alcohol testing you know breath <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">analyzers</ENAMEX> or something
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well right now with a with air line <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> and stuff i i now my stepfather works for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest Airlines</ENAMEX> and they had a
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		a thing a a while back and he knew one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> that got in trouble for i guess he had gone out <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the night</TIMEX> before
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and um
 		had had to much to drink and you are not suppose to drink within
 		i think i think it's like twelve <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty four</TIMEX> i know there's a certain
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh</ENAMEX> before they go a back on there jobs
 	
 	
 		yeah before before they get back on the job and and he had been been within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that time</TIMEX> period
 	
 	
 		yeah right
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and
 	
 	
 		yeah that's that's that's yeah i know it's
 	
 	
 		they got they came down on on him hard for that
 	
 	
 		i'm sure he did and he was probably perfectly capable you there was nothing at all that he couldn't have done you know as far as his job
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		yeah it just change it vary so much from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person person</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> is  it's a subjective type thing
 	
 	
 		you know
 		that's true that's true
 		yeah and uh i mean i never thought about it but you know you may drink and uh drink a hole lot <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one night</TIMEX> and you may be going out going somewhere <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next day</TIMEX> like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> and you you be perfectly fine all over again and uh if they did a test on you you might not pass
 	
 	
 		you never know
 	
 	
 		you know just just from <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the night</TIMEX> before and um you know that's that's sort like the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> testing you know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		and it it seems there there are a lot of profession now it seems like
 		um you know am sure the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> doesn't get drug tested but he's got a lot of responsibilities and
 	
 	
 		that's right yeah
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> as as seems like you know some things
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		if there are going to do it
 		you know like i know a lot of government
 		um jobs are
 	
 	
 		yeah that's that's true yeah that's true
 	
 	
 		require drug testing
 		you know
 		it seems like they should uh not
 	
 	
 		right i know what you are saying
 	
 	
 		be you know they should not be hypocritical about it
 	
 	
 		that's right if you know um if you know if they're going to do it just do it totally <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> wide every job there is you know or or else you know just don't do it
 	
 	
 		they having such a big problem with the
 	
 	
 		i mean it makes good sense
 	
 	
 		the drug war anyway its
 	
 	
 		yeah really i mean that's where the real problem is
 		i mean um but where i work uh i think they have talked about it you know and uh but nothing like that has come up at all you know
