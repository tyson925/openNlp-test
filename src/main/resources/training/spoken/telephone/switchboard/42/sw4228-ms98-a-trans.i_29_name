 
     		
 	
 		kind of dream <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> do you want to buy
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh gee do i want to buy i don't know that i really  want a whole lot more other other than what i got i just uh got a car about uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fourteen fifteen fifteen months ago</TIMEX> now
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh i bought a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Taurus</ENAMEX> um
 		the thing i want always wanted a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> with a big trunk so i can carry a lot of stuff that's one of the prime considerations
 		i want something that's reasonably reliable and something that's not likely to get expensively damaged in a small crash and you can't get <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> you got got to give up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or the other
 	
 	
 		hm that's interesting
 		yeah uh reliability and an economy you know if you drive a lot but
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah the the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">fuel</ENAMEX> economy is not a big factor uh especially with the way that gasoline prices now are below what they were in nineteen eighty of course they were pretty outrageous then but but
 	
 	
 		in real dollars yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah in in real dollars it's just not not much of a factor um you know the uh
 		what your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ma</ENAMEX> call its it does it's it's less than insurance i think  for example
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true but i think that's really artificial you know that's unfortunate it's unfortunate it's
 		it should probably uh taxed or something to
 	
 	
 		well i don't that's that would be that would be reasonable i think i'm i'm wondering about the economic justification for taxing gasoline some more you say well it's a a nonrenewable resource uh
 	
 	
 		limit that
 	
 	
 		but i don't know there's lots of nonrenewable nonrenewable resources that one could tax just because they're nonrenewable including everything you mine out of the ground um
 		i don't know if if there really is that justification but uh it certainly is is more more palatable to have them tax gasoline and use it to
 		build <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX> than it is to have them take take tolls which means you got to stop and means that
 	
 	
 		huh
 		but uh getting back to the topic i guess i guess kind of pushed i guess i kind of pushed us off to the side  supposed to be talking about <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> not
 	
 	
 		excuse me
 		yeah but there's nobody that checks you see we could actually talk about anything but um if you i mean bring us bring us back to the topic if you'd like
 	
 	
 		yeah well um i don't know
 		uh you know i guess the uh i was like interested in like the uh the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Honda</ENAMEX> VX
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		has the uh lean burn and all that stuff supposed to be very fuel efficient so it gives you about the same kind of horsepower
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh boosts your uh mileage by like uh <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">almost ten twenty miles per gallon</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hm</ENAMEX> so what would you get uh you know what what are the what are the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> fuel economy numbers
 	
 	
 		almost in the fifties
 	
 	
 		hm
 		yeah that's that's pretty good now i don't know how big the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> is i mean does it have a big trunk that's sort of the bottom line
 	
 	
 		well you can you know like a well <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Civic</ENAMEX> is is like a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Corolla</ENAMEX> or something it it's
 	
 	
 		yeah that's no good
 	
 	
 		it's it's not as well hey it's in some ways it's not quite as big as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Taurus</ENAMEX> but then it's not too much smaller either um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but
 	
 	
 		someday and and you know if you have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> then you're gonna want to have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> room for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> and and uh
 	
 	
 		no dreams for a sports <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> of any kind
 	
 	
 		no i just i'm i just um um
 		well you you can't drive it any faster than the other <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> anyway it's not allowed you know but
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		and and most sports <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> don't have room for anything in them that's not my kind of vehicle
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so you'd rather have  a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of those big vans
 	
 	
 		well i maybe i don't know about a van the thing i i hate when i hate it when i'm behind <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vans</ENAMEX> but being in one would be the opposite effect you could see over everything that would be helpful
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um so many times you get behind somebody and you wonder what's up ahead and if that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> stops then you might have a hard time stopping
 		so you or you or you just can't see around it like somebody could come in from an intersection you couldn't see it because the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">van</ENAMEX> blocks your field of view but uh
 	
 	
 		what do you have a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">station wagon</ENAMEX> or a regular
 	
 	
 		no i got a regular <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> but you know <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four four</NUMEX> door sedan
 	
 	
 		uh-huh do you have those uh split seats that fold down
 	
 	
 		yep um-hum
 	
 	
 		from the uh the trunk that's a good innovation
 	
 	
 		oh no no not the one for the trunk i didn't get that one that would have been good but uh
 	
 	
 		then you could put a lot more in
 	
 	
 		i could
 		oh yeah you could do that right uh i thought i thought it was that but it just doesn't work i mean there just is it would it would be it would be it would be nice if i could do that i agree
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		is that well well let's let's put it this way the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> manual doesn't say anything about it now i don't know it's maybe it's an undocumented
 	
 	
 		that's interesting
 		
 
 		are you one to read manuals before using something
 	
 	
 		this one is so much longer than any other one that i that i that i ever saw that that i didn't even think about writing it now reading now when i was a little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX> and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> got new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> then i would always read the manual
 		
 
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i guess so hey it's a it's a substitute for something  wanting to drive
 	
 	
 		but
 		yeah
 		yeah once i learned to drive
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		that story was different
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		oh i don't know i i i i don't know i like um
 		i i like those
