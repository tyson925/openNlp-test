 
     		
 	
 		uh in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX> we have just recently in about like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> uh in the fall they started uh a blue bag and and blue container uh sort of program where you know is that the same for you
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		um well we just have to have put it out in a separate container is is that a curbside pickup then
 	
 	
 		yeah it's curbside and also uh we have a dumpster in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment building</ENAMEX> where i live and there's a blue dumpster too
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		when you go to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">supermarket</ENAMEX> they give you uh plastic blue plastic bags
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		but i don't think it works out so well where i live uh i'm in in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">university</ENAMEX> area uh well because the blue dumpster gets full uh with other things as well so
 		i know that the they reject the uh recyclables when they're mixed with other trash so it probably doesn't work out too well
 	
 	
 		yeah as as as as a matter well it's a matter of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> starting to respect it and understanding what it's for and understanding that it actually does help everybody if they all recycle
 	
 	
 		yeah but it but also uh it this seems kind of it's kind of bad but i think it needs to be more convenient to recycle i mean that that almost seems like it's it's as recycle as convenient as it could be
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but the problem is that you have the garbage dump right there and then you have the recycling dumpster bin right next to it
 	
 	
 		yeah you just you just need to uh keep a separate container in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> or whatever and separate there
 	
 	
 		yeah but it is pretty nice though that the supermarket i'm not sure whether i mentioned this uh they give you the the the blue plastic bags uh along when you when you buy your <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">groceries</ENAMEX> and you just use those to recycle
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		so is is that mixed all recyclables do you or is it only uh cans and bottles and stuff
 	
 	
 		well <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">right now</TIMEX> and i was just going to go look for the little pamphlet i have about that uh but it's um
 		bottles and cans and they've just added paper to it but what i'm not sure is whether or not you can put them all in the same bag i usually separate them
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 		yeah <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New New Jersey</ENAMEX> has since <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Jersey</ENAMEX> has had a major waste problem for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of years</TIMEX> now
 		um right now at least in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> i'm in they collect all recyclables paper you know <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX> and junk mail in one bag
 		and then mix together cans bottles and that's both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aluminum</ENAMEX> and bimetal cans as well as uh plastics like your soda bottles laundry <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">detergent</ENAMEX> bottles that type of thing
 	
 	
 		right i'm not sure
 	
 	
 		and you just put it put it all together into one bin it's nice and convenient
 	
 	
 		yeah i think i think uh i think you can put them all in into the same bin i'm like i like i said i have been separating them just because i'm not sure
 		uh but i'm i know that the one restriction they have is that uh you're you're not supposed to you you well obviously you have to clean out anything that had <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> in it or you know whatever you're not supposed to put things that could have been contaminated
 	
 	
 		right
 		do do you have to soak off all the labels too
 	
 	
 		uh no i don't soak off the labels  because that that would be a pretty big pain i i i'm like i i'm not quite sure about the exact policy uh
 		because i thought i had uh something laying around uh that specified what the policy was but i could never find it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so i i mean i'm sure i'm sure that it doesn't take that much to to remove the the labels it's at least doing something um
 		but i know i mean if if i did there all the rest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment building</ENAMEX> that i that i i live in probably wouldn't because because there's just just a matter of education it's it's just not there
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well it it it's that and also in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment building</ENAMEX> you don't have the fear of being caught
 	
 	
 		oh that's true
 	
 	
 		yeah oh in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Jersey</ENAMEX> they will or they at least they can i i haven't really heard of anyone doing this if you put recyclables in with your regular trash they can refuse to pick up your trash
 	
 	
 		right well that's
 	
 	
 		but whereas if you're living in an apartment <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> there's no way of tracing back who put in what
 	
 	
 		right well what they do uh i i i don't know anyone that uh has has had had this happen to them because no one that i know has a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> in the recycling areas yet
 		but uh if you walk along after garbage pickup day uh some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> will have their bags still sitting out there with a little note on it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		which i've never read <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> but i'm assuming is probably telling them telling them why they couldn't pickup that particular uh bag but
 	
 	
 		yeah they they'll do they'll do that here too if uh you put out let's say your <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glass</ENAMEX> and cans in a paper bag they'll put a big orange sticker on it saying put it out in a plastic bag or a separate container
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		you know what though i bet if they they could certainly just stick the the rental <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> with with the uh with the bill or or whatever and they just give the rental have the rental <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> have more responsibility because they're really
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		in that respect they're the only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who could have any you know any control over over it over over educating their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tenants</ENAMEX> or you know
 	
 	
 		yeah the the the problem with that is it's such a long way it doesn't ever get back to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tenants</ENAMEX> that this is something you really need to do because even if they do a slight rent increase it's so small and over such a long period of time that no one notices
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah the the only other way to uh make it a little more um
 		useful for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to do is what they had down in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Atlanta</ENAMEX>
