 
     		
 	
 		a loaded question what do you think about gun control
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rick</ENAMEX>
 		well as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> living in one of the areas that's got both the uh one of the most restrictive set of laws and one of the uh highest murder rates in the uh country
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um i happen to be an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponent</ENAMEX> of gun control
 	
 	
 		well that's interesting
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i happen to be um
 		kind of funny of course i had a radical turn around in my attitude about that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about four or five years ago</TIMEX>
 		and um along with some other political uh what do you call it um
 		changes too i formerly was one of your typical <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> left wingers
 	
 	
 		that you know that's what i suspected
 	
 	
 		and um
 	
 	
 		
 
 		talking to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Yorker</ENAMEX> i thought that i'd hear someone who was totally for gun control
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well we're not all like that um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about a year ago</TIMEX> i engaged in the arduous <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six month</TIMEX> prices process of getting a fire arms license
 	
 	
 		oh my
 	
 	
 		and um
 		not long after that my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> engaged in a similar process and now when we get a chance which is entirely too infrequently we can go down to the range and shoot together
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i used to do a lot of that it it can be a lot of fun
 	
 	
 		all right where you are you can go to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sears</ENAMEX> right
 	
 	
 		uh yeah i think so
 	
 	
 		really yeah
 	
 	
 		i'm not i'm i'm not sure about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sears</ENAMEX> but i know the sporting goods <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> and i know <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sears</ENAMEX> used to sell <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX> i just i'm aggravated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sears</ENAMEX> right now
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah you know the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> are here but it's you know you walk in and i'd like to look at that okay fine let me see your paperwork
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh it's kind of funny because um we are going out to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> in a while and uh out there you can walk into apparently there are ranges where they rent which is something that to me is completely foreign
 	
 	
 		bet
 	
 	
 		but uh yeah i may get a chance to try out some things i've never tried out before
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah well i grew up in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX> and you know <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX> were a fact of life
 	
 	
 		ah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh my granddad hunted and what not you you mentioned uh
 		uh that you've gotten the fire arm permit is this for a hand <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">gun</ENAMEX> or does are there uh there are the laws as restrictive for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">rifles</ENAMEX> and shot guns
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">rifle</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">shotgun</ENAMEX> you've got to sign the federal form but that's about it
 	
 	
 		i see
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">um</ENAMEX> and i really don't know where they stand on semiautomatics these days
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh they've been getting a lot of bad press
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um
 		it's uh
 	
 	
 		well you know i guess i could summarize my feelings about it as that uh
 		i would like no restrictions on me and a total ban on most people
 	
 	
 		sounds fair
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um
 	
 	
 		my ex-husband would choke if he heard me say that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well you know it um you know it's kind of interesting you say that because we had a series about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year and a half</TIMEX> ago
 		of murders here <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> within the space of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about two months</TIMEX>
 		and the profile of all of them was
 		a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> got separated the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> had menacing the his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ex-wife</ENAMEX>
 		um they filed the court order to keep him away he got picked up once or twice and then the last time he didn't get picked up he just came in there and uh and killed the woman
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and there were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> of these within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of months</TIMEX> and nobody seems to connect with the idea that um
 		you know there are you know that maybe just maybe she could've uh had a better shot at it if um she'd been armed
 	
 	
 		literally yeah
 	
 	
 		you know at uh
 	
 	
 		and in all those cases were those murders by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX> probably
 	
 	
 		um i don't think so i think that there made a strangulation or stabbing in there you know i don't know the specifics but um
 		you know it uh  what was that
 		oh my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> is screaming shotgun
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		either go get it or uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		or what um
 		what do you call we had uh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> of mine who would
 		maybe this is fundamentally my attitude changing
 		uh when he pointed out that the purpose of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> was not to prevent crime
 		and uh you know that's something we all actually  except that is the purpose of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> and i said what do you mean by that
 		and his comment was
 		well in order to prevent a crime the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> have to be where the crime is taking place now they can't be everywhere they can be very good at deterring crime
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		they can be very good capturing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">criminals</ENAMEX> and enforcing the punishment of crime but they can't be good at preventing it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so if the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> aren't going to prevent it who is
 	
 	
 		i see
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and uh i thought it was you know um um a very nice elegant piece of logic there and it's absolutely true you know it
 		you know so and i imagine the more rural you get that the truer that is
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know um kind of funny i was just looking at a book <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> where some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fellow</ENAMEX> was screaming his his <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> had been stolen
 		and he was screaming at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> primarily because <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about two days</TIMEX> before you know they were telling him we're spread to thin to enforce car theft and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few days</TIMEX> before they'd given him a ticket for parking <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">fifteen minutes</TIMEX> late at a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">meter</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know  a matter of priorities i guess
 	
 	
 		yeah  yeah i can understand that
 	
 	
 		yeah but um
 		
 
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> are you a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the NRA
 	
 	
 		as a matter of fact
 	
 	
 		are you  recently
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">card</ENAMEX> carrying um it's about uh i think it was renewed for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> time
 	
 	
 		is that right
 	
 	
 		and um
 	
 	
 		my ex was a long term member of the NRA
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah it's interesting of course one of the things that um
 		yeah i i don't know
