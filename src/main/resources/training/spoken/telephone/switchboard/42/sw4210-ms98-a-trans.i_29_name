 
     		
 	
 		what kind of air pollution do you think is the worst
 	
 	
 		
 
 		in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philadelphia</ENAMEX> i think the worst is <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		because there isn't a lot of manufacturing right in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philadelphia</ENAMEX> any more at least not any heavy manufacturing
 	
 	
 		yeah but they couldn't there is a lot of different pollution you can get from <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> right
 	
 	
 		right a lot of pollution from <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> and also the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trucks</ENAMEX> that drive around through so i think transportation is the worst right here in the city
 	
 	
 		um-hum there is carbon <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">monoxide carbon dioxide</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh right uh-huh
 	
 	
 		nitric oxide
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		the all that kind of stuff
 	
 	
 		and plus we get the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chlorofluorocarbons</ENAMEX> i guess from the old refrigerator and old <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah and there's ozone
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		it's like uh from
 		also like when you fill-up your <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> with gas
 	
 	
 		well you know in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philadelphia</ENAMEX> they've got these gas vapor recovery nozzle on all the gas tank now
 	
 	
 		oh yeah that's right
 	
 	
 		if you go to the gas pump you it just sucks it back out
 	
 	
 		yeah um-hum yeah
 	
 	
 		it makes it really hard to tell when your <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tank</ENAMEX> is full though
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		because you can't really lessen very well
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		you have to just trust the automatic shut off
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so you can't really get it full if you are going on a long its really hard
 	
 	
 		huh
 		well let's see what else there's uh
 		more more sometimes they say it more pollution inside your house
 	
 	
 		yeah from all the gas stoves and everything yeah
 	
 	
 		well i got the dry cleaning
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		that stuff is pretty nasty nasty
 		um i know all the kind of fumes you can get from bathroom cleaners your aerosols
 	
 	
 		that's true though most help aid don't let me use
 		bathroom cleaner with bad uh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemicals</ENAMEX> in them any more
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chlorofluorocarbons chlorofluorocarbons chlorofluorocarbons</ENAMEX> or something like that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chlorofluorocarbons</ENAMEX> that's it
 	
 	
 		right they make me use <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simple Green</ENAMEX> or um they will let me use Comet or self <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cleanser</ENAMEX> but
 	
 	
 		what simple simple green is supposedly  it not toxic really
 	
 	
 		right it it suppose to be none toxics and its suppose to be good for the environment
 	
 	
 		oh yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		so they like that
 		i prefer uh
 		ammonia
 		and um
 		there's something my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mamma</ENAMEX> gave me
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last time</TIMEX> i was visiting her its a
 		it's called scrub free it really makes a bad odor though so my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">housemate</ENAMEX> don't like that
 	
 	
 		what is it
 	
 	
 		scrub free
 	
 	
 		scrub free huh
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		you know i knew that the air in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philadelphia</ENAMEX> was not the greatest when i <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> came here it i lived where i could on a clear day
 		see the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walt Whitman</ENAMEX> bridge but i couldn't see it for a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of months</TIMEX> until it got to be <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter time</TIMEX> and the pollution cleared up
 	
 	
 		oh really where are you originally from
 	
 	
 		from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Carolina</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh huh
 	
 	
 		but the amazing thing i was out at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few years ago</TIMEX> and the air there is so clean
 	
 	
 		well not always depends if you don't there if there's a brief stop then you get the uh smog
 	
 	
 		
  
 		right
 	
 	
 		doesn't move like you're out in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lake</ENAMEX> Tahoe its like that you can really smell the gas fumes from <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> the air is trap and it doesn't go anywhere
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		in fact the worst place is probably in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico Mexico City</ENAMEX> i heard is
 	
 	
 		right on the top of the mountain yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well they validated i think uh
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two hundred day</TIMEX> uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> out of a year over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three or four</NUMEX> times the
 		known you know the allowable limit
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		it crazy and uh some of the worst kind that our you can have also air pollution you can just have cigarette smoke
 		stuck in
 	
 	
 		oh cigarette smoke the worst place for air pollution of cigarette smoke is the laundry <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mat</ENAMEX> i hate that
 	
 	
 		in a laundry mate
 	
 	
 		right when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> come in and they're smoking while they're waiting for their clothes and you take yours out
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and they're all clean and you want to hang them up and
 	
 	
 		oh gosh
 	
 	
 		there all these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> smoking there
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		really wow
 	
 	
 		fortunately i've started going at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an hour</TIMEX> where not many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> smoke
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		but
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		i really hated that when that was a problem for me
 	
 	
 		i know which is worst cigar smoke or regular cigarette smoke
 	
 	
 		uh boy
 		um
 		boy i'll chose regular cigarette smoke
 	
 	
 		yeah hum
 	
 	
 		but if there was as many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> smoking cigars as there were cigarettes cigar smoke would definitely be worst
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh i don't know its a lot of smoke out uh out her you can see um
 		the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Jersey</ENAMEX> when you go by the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">refinery</ENAMEX> or even when you go across the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delaware River</ENAMEX>
 		down by uh
 		it passes away but down as you go down toward <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ninety five</NUMEX> you see all that
 		that stuff that comes out of the refineries
 	
 	
 		oh right
