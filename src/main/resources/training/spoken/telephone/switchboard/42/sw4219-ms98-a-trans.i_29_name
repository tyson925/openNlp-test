 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		i'm waiting to get  my cocker from her
 	
 	
 		that would be good now we got the peekaboo as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">puppy</ENAMEX> but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Airedale</ENAMEX> was was pretty much grown
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		she was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple years old</TIMEX>
 		and um she had been trained and everything before we got her
 	
 	
 		is she papered
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		does she have her papers
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		but she um she was from a really good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">of</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> you know if that you know whatever you want to call it but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um the only thing was one she was she was use to being on a ranch a big wide open and then i brought her to our our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">duplex</ENAMEX> and we had a fence in back yard
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and so the only problem with her was when you open the gate she was gone
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and this <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> if the said sit she'll sit you said lay she she'll lay you tell her go get in your pin she'll go get in her pin
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and she wouldn't come out but if you got her out behind the fence or behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> inside the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> she would not come when you call her
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it would just be she's gone she's gone and she's gone that's it she open up she open the gate by herself
 		you know she would take her nose and flip it open and get out
 	
 	
 		really
 		not very many  learned how to do that
 	
 	
 		
  
 		she was very smart
 	
 	
 		i know my shepherd did and it
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		it just really floored me when it it happen
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		because i went out there to feed here one mourning and she was just gone
 	
 	
 		
  
 		she was just gone
 	
 	
 		and i was like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reba Reba</ENAMEX> where in the heck are you
 	
 	
 		
  
 		i was about to die i thought my goodness we've only had this dog <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day two days</TIMEX> and she's already gone and i spent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all day</TIMEX> looking for her
 	
 	
 		i thought somebody stole <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reba</ENAMEX> at first because she was a black and silver shepherd and they are really hard to come by
 	
 	
 		
  
 		they are
 	
 	
 		and she was you know she had her papers and everything
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		and i thought somebody stole her at first
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and then i she came wondering back later that day with a rabbit in her mouth and just went right back into her pin
 	
 	
 		
  
 		oh my goodness
 		
  
 	
 	
 		and i went out there the next mourning to feed her and i put her <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> in there and i walked out the gate and pretty soon i heard the gate slick open and she comes walking out behind me i was like
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		well that isn't going to work
 	
 	
 		
  
 		no they used <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Molly</ENAMEX> um this is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> that um
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John</ENAMEX> my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband aunt</ENAMEX> had brought
 		and that's how i had got her i couldn't have afforded to buy her i mean they are expensive
