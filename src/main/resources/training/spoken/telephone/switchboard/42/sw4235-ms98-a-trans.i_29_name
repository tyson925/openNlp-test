 
     		
 	
 		so i get most of my news i i am sorry to say from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNN Headline News</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so i'm not sure how remarkably well informed i am by their like <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> second sound bytes about everything
 		but uh i'm a college <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> at this point and uh when i come in when i turn that on for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">half an hour</TIMEX> i see what's going on and then i turn it off and
 		so how do you get your news
 	
 	
 		uh to tell you the truth i get most of my stuff uh news from printed media um news <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazines</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX> uh newspapers
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		i'll watch television at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">in the evening</TIMEX> for local news but uh
 		you know for national things i i tend to go more for printed media uh media because they they don't give you the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> sound bytes the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three seconds</TIMEX> uh gee he looks good in a in a camera you know uh although i have to admit i'm dissatisfied with the
 	
 	
 		right
 		
 
 	
 	
 		quality that you get in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX> it's unfortunate but
 	
 	
 		which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX> in particular like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA Today</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		that's been
 		well uh well let's see uh no no actually we're <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LA Times</ENAMEX> we also get the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times</ENAMEX> out here um
 	
 	
 		oh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and then of course there are lots of specialized <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publications</ENAMEX> for you know i work in engineering so you get engineering uh stuff uh what i found is that uh
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh you know you are subjected to censorship uh even though that's a bad word uh what happens is an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">editor</ENAMEX> has to decide what will fit in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX> and what gets dropped on the floor and that's censorship
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		well that i think that comes about from the fact that that the the news gathering business is is just that a business
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		so they're going to tell you what sells and also although i don't believe this is really that rampant at now uh you know <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sponsors</ENAMEX> or or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">advertisers</ENAMEX> could have some influence as well over over what uh eventually gets printed
 	
 	
 		i uh
 		i i agree with that i've seen that in several uh computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazines</ENAMEX> where you know if the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> buys <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> pages of of color ads then he gets a pretty good review in when they review products
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and also i think you'll also notice if you ever do watch <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNN Headline News</ENAMEX> that anytime <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ted Turner</ENAMEX> does anything  he shows up on there
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">uh</ENAMEX>  gets a favorable light cast on it
 	
 	
 		yeah you you know what though uh i kind of wish that i would uh watch more local news because i end up uh sometimes missing things and hearing them secondhand just because i never do sit down to watch the real news
 	
 	
 		well you know there's a big problem with the the local news is something we've noticed i mean out here in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LA</ENAMEX> we get <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gang</ENAMEX> shootings you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and so what you can do is you turn on the local news and if it's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a bad weekend</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the first fifteen minutes</TIMEX> on a on a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> or a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> will be how many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> got shot and killed
 	
 	
 		i think that's the way it usually is they they work from the you know the headline stories you know those ones basically <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> being killed and murdered and and suffering then they go into like
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know sports and weather then they end up on the really nice stuff so that you're not depressed by the time you're done watching the broadcast
 	
 	
 		right
 		a lot of a lot of times though there there isn't the really nice stuff
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		oh yeah the uh in in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least the</TIMEX> the news <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stations</ENAMEX> that we watch here in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LA</ENAMEX> and i mean you know it's it's uh uh maybe it's just because they're stuck with  more bad news than good news
 	
 	
 		um it's a possiblity
 	
 	
 		uh but uh you know it's it's it's unfortunate but even even now i mean i used to live in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> and we still get uh we lived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> and so we still get some <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> language <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazines</ENAMEX> some
 	
 	
 		where in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		i get the
 	
 	
 		
  
 		okay we get
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh the thing is that you know that of course is slanted
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		from a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> point of view and uh you know what you notice are the glaring differences between how <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> perceives
 		some monumentous event in the world versus how the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Germans</ENAMEX> perceive that same event
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and i mean it's uh you know the the difficulty is that okay they're it's a business over there like it is here they're slanting it toward their uh public and we're slanting it toward our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> and you know the question is what's the real truth
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		well i think that's
 		uh it's kind of related to like who writes history because obviously the the news eventually does become history it's just always going to be someone's the prevailing opinion
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		well unless you have a particularly strong
 	
 	
 		the winners
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">disparity</ENAMEX> and there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> you know <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> competing views exist
 	
 	
 		well it's also again um you know the
 		the uh the the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who write the history it's their view and from wherever they happen to be i mean what we've noticed is that um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh the the way the uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> are handling <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Germans</ENAMEX> view that as a critical new market and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> are well you know the
 	
 	
 		right
 		apart from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McDonald's</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		well yeah yeah and the uh the thing is that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> are well we don't really don't want to get involved with that we don't want to help them they've got to learn to help themselves you know free market economy
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right
