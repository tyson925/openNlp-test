 
     		
 	
 		so uh how do you go about doing household finances
 	
 	
 		
  
 		
  
 		pretty loosely  i don't have a i've never have a
 	
 	
 		yeah me too
 	
 	
 		had a tremendously organized budget i've you know kind of know how much the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</TIMEX> bills are by
 		you know looking at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the previous month</TIMEX> and i know about what the minimum payments are so i just kind of put it down on paper and
 		and estimate but as far as actually having a real tight uh organized budget that you stay within i've i've just always kind of freelanced as far as that goes
 	
 	
 		boy me too it's uh fly by the seat of my pants
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		uh in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the old days</TIMEX> when my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> and i both worked we we probably a little bit more organized with it
 		because we would divide up the bills she had her own checking account and she would take responsibility for paying so many bills and i had my own and i would take responsibility for so many and
 		and generally entertainment expense so uh everything seemed to work out pretty smoothly
 		but uh that was for about the first uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eighteen years</TIMEX> of our marriage
 		then she dropped out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">work force</ENAMEX> and uh
 	
 	
 		
  
 		
  
 	
 	
 		we we have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> both under <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> so uh
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		i i've taken total responsibility but i guess i haven't taken
 	
 	
 		
  
 		you've got <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> now under <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		they'll be yeah they'll be uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four and two</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX> respectively
 	
 	
 		
  
 		i've got a senior in high school who's just just getting out in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		we're probably the same age
 	
 	
 		
  
 		yeah i'm <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">forty four</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">forty two</NUMEX> yeah most most of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> have uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> uh you who are having <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> it seems like
 	
 	
 		and
 		
  
 	
 	
 		but uh we
 	
 	
 		we actually ran one checkbook with i mean <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> account with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> checkbooks off the same account for a long for a long time
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but that's real dangerous when one is supposed to make a deposit and doesn't or or writes an extra couple of checks and either forgets to tell the other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> about it or something you know so we finally switched to
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> method too it seemed to work better
 	
 	
 		yeah i think when uh uh when we were both running separate checking accounts i think there was uh more of a sense of respectful responsibility
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		uh  it almost demanded coordination in splitting up bills and stuff
 	
 	
 		oh sure
 	
 	
 		now it's my paycheck i put it in and i pay the bills and uh uh it doesn't i'm not being critical but my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> kind of has
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		the sense that the checkbook is just a blank check
 		you know and it's unlimited funds not that she goes out and spends it unlimitedly but it's almost that attitude
 	
 	
 		you still got checks you still got money right
 	
 	
 		yeah right yeah that's yeah that's kind of how it comes out
 	
 	
 		well we been we each have our own business and so especially once that got established it was easier for her to run her deal and me to run <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mine</ENAMEX> and uh not really
 	
 	
 		uh
 		
  
 		um
 		
  
 	
 	
 		mix the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> and uh the you know bills that are
 		if we're both paying on a certain thing like the a school tuition then <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one or</NUMEX> of the other of us writes the other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> a check for their portion
 		and then <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> mails it all you know to the to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX> or whoever
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		if it's something we're doing that way if it's uh if it's something that one or the other of us is handling in its entirety then then we just pay it like you do
 	
 	
 		
  
 		yeah well how how do you manage control uh or limit your spending or or you know do you uh
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		in our in our case it's more of a a philosophy like you know for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next few months</TIMEX> we're really going to watch it and we'll try try to control the big things
 	
 	
 		well
 		
  
 		uh it's kind of the way it is it's it's never been uh like my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> is organized to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n-th</ENAMEX> degree he and i are exactly opposite he's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</TIMEX> younger than i am and
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		he budgets every penny he knows where every little thing is and he's a real tight wad with uh the money and i've always been a little looser
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		
  
 		well that's how we both are
 	
 	
 		and we just kind of like you say if we need to watch it we watch it and and not spend any you know big amounts of money uh
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		during a a certain period of time if we got a little excess and decide to splurge and buy something you know then that's kind of a joint
 	
 	
 		yeah we we
 		
  
 	
 	
 		thing too so
 	
 	
 		yeah we went through a period uh well we went through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six years</TIMEX> of infertility
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		and it uh it was expensive we were writing out checks for you know <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">eight hundred dollar</NUMEX> prescriptions and medical procedures and all of that
 	
 	
 		oh yeah those are
 		
  
 	
 	
 		and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> was working at the time so it it and most of it was you know reimbursable on insurance so we had you know big cash flow and it was a little bit of a management problem but it wasn't too difficult with the two incomes
 		and then we got to the point where we really decided we probably couldn't have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> so we sort of indulged and we
 		uh leased some expensive <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> and took a vacation yeah it
 	
 	
 		that'll do it everytime
 		you immediately get pregnant if you do that
 	
 	
 		well that's what exactly what happened yeah we
