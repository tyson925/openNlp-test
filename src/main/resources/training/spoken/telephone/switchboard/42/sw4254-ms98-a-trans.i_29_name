 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well uh
 	
 	
 		i guess that was it um
 		i guess the uh it's interesting that they asked the benefits question i think because uh
 		we just merged with another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">um division</ENAMEX> in our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> and actually have different slightly different benefits
 		so i guess the the things i'd look for um kind of things i call like safety net
 		features like health insurance and uh possibly
 		um retirement pension sorts of incentives
 		and then i guess there's the things for like personal growth like uh educational reimbursement tuition like tuition reimbursement or uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		um
 		maybe uh money used for some kind of wellness program like to join a fitness <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> or something like that would be
 	
 	
 		yeah but
 	
 	
 		be interested in seeing
 	
 	
 		i think it's important to have some place to go over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</TIMEX> in a within a company uh i work for uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		a university but we do defense contracts
 		and  with my job
 		there's not much place to go i mean there's not there's not
 		what you're hired in as is what you end up as
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		and the benefits are okay but i'd rather have more security
 	
 	
 		that's interesting yeah i i was actually at uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carnegie Mellon</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX> doing uh
 		um i guess on research <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> there and i i got a feeling that uh
 		you know there wasn't really it wasn't really designed to provide real opportunities for advancement unless you happen to you know like
 		a doctorate in something and then you could
 		you know look at the you'd be eligible for the uh
 		you know the uh
 	
 	
 		are are uh you with with a university <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> now
 	
 	
 		more important position than
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you are well
 	
 	
 		well no i'm not i'm sorry i'm at uh i'm actually doing um consulting in the commercial
 	
 	
 		um what
 	
 	
 		in in industry
 	
 	
 		when i say it was a i like security but
 		
 
 		what we did was a uh mostly radar some
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		counter stuff for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russians</ENAMEX> and things so i don't really exactly have a whole lot of security right now
 	
 	
 		well that's interesting
 	
 	
 		since uh
 		they're not doing so good they're not a threat anymore so
 	
 	
 		yeah but it seems like other uh
 		the other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that are on the verge or already have <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missiles</ENAMEX> that those kinds of systems would be good at uh you know early detection
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm i'm  most all those systems are the same they came were originated <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> so
 	
 	
 		or
 		oh okay so it's not viewed as
 		that's interesting
 	
 	
 		it's not real good you have good good benefits like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">vacation days</TIMEX> does that mean much to you
 	
 	
 		um actually i never thought of that i i i i guess i assumed that's part of the uh
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		package but um
 		i guess if the salary was you know enough then i might just make my own you know take the unpaid time off but uh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">um</ENAMEX> as long as you know it's not uh
 		i guess what's more important than vacation is actually having the time to use it because a lot of times we're in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">projects</ENAMEX> where you know where the dates are critical and it's it's a little harder to plan a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">vacation</TIMEX>
 		when you're in that kind of environment
 	
 	
 		
  
 		we have it pretty good because i we we take our vacation anytime we want by the hour by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the day</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		um
 		it's good
 	
 	
 		i really like that if it's a pretty day uh if the work's not pressing i go fishing
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that means a lot to me it it it takes a lot of the stress of the job out too
 	
 	
 		so so like a consistent work load would that be kind of a  is that  i don't know if that's considered a benefit it's just in kind of part of the environment you're in
 	
 	
 		
  
 		well we're spaced in timing too uh when we get toward the end of a contract then it's uh you can't leave
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and we're always behind time behind schedule out of money you have to donate your time and
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		
 
 		we charge you know about <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> accounting purposes to the projects so there's no way that
 		that you can take off vacation and charge it back to the project
 	
 	
 		yeah huh
 	
 	
 		so they're out of money
 		so i don't know my next job i think i'm going to look at health insurance closer than i did this one
 	
 	
 		interesting
 		yeah it it's only been a problem i guess in our  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> seems like um about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> after i joined was when they started
 		passing on a lot higher percentage of the increases they were getting from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carriers</ENAMEX> but i've got an HMO
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		um with <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mine</ENAMEX> because i've got
 	
 	
 		what what sort of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</TIMEX> uh uh charges are uh are you uh married do you have family
 	
 	
 		yeah uh one we're growing another um a little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> on the way it looks like
 	
 	
 		
 
 		all right well what's your <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</TIMEX> for your uh the health insurance
 	
 	
 		so uh
 		uh let's see it's um like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> dollars a pay period so it's every <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks</TIMEX> so it's about
