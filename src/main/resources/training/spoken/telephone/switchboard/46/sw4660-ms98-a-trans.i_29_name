 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay how do you get your news mostly
 	
 	
 		generally i get most of my news from uh the radio and then sometimes um if i've got time i'll be reading the front page of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX> and just fall off on the articles that i like
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">um</ENAMEX> also since my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> likes to watch TV sometimes uh  just having being just being there i get uh you know i have to watch the news <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">late at night</TIMEX> with TV
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum  well i can hardly wait for my <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> to come
 	
 	
 		how about you
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so that's the first thing i want is the headlines
 		it's really funny because um uh my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> grabs the sports and i grab the headlines
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 		but uh and then when <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five o'clock</TIMEX> comes around i just wanna get in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and turn the TV on to watch the news
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		it's really weird uh i don't stay up late to watch late news because my eyes won't stay up that long
 		but um  i love to watch the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five o'clock</TIMEX> news and i makes me angry when my paper <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX>'s not there on time so i can read my paper
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		uh i do have my radio going most of the day though so <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about every hour</TIMEX> it breaks in and gives me news too you know but
 	
 	
 		okay do you get what like one of the talk stations the news stations
 	
 	
 		no huh-uh just i just have a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> that has music except for like <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">every hour</TIMEX> you know say <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">eight o'clock nine o'clock</TIMEX> they come on for just a little bit of the news
 	
 	
 		sure
 		right
 	
 	
 		but as far as the actual news i get that from
 		from the can you hold on just for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a second</TIMEX> just a minute
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">hello</ENAMEX> sir  yes i'm sorry to keep you waiting  um i was calling from work so and that was a call waiting
 	
 	
 		yes
 		okay
 		right sounds it sounds like you uh you like the news a lot more than i do me i figure if it's something really important somebody will tell me about it
 		but uh you know i thing is if if i catch the news all the time it just makes me depressed because they tend to produce a lot of bad news or that's what comes on first
 	
 	
 		yeah i get
 		um that's true too
 	
 	
 		and uh you know it also late at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> you know i don't want like watching the news <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">late at night</TIMEX> but my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>'s usually up then and so you know i can't go to sleep with the TV on
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i uh
 		but you know i i wish i had uh more news on things like that i consider long range things like science and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX> um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i'm more i guess i'm more into science and science fiction and uh there's you know not that the news is science fiction but uh
 		uh i'm more interested in that things like uh is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX> ready for another space shot uh you know how hot are they on the trail of a cure for such and such <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> and uh um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know a lot of the news isn't that interesting to me
 	
 	
 		yeah well you're right there is a lot of it that's that's just garbage as far as i'm concerned you know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but i just like the more or less the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the daily</TIMEX> news you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		just uh especially the weather i like that  although they're usually wrong
 	
 	
 		me too
 		yeah <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Georgia</ENAMEX> here they're usually wrong too we have weird weather systems
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		but uh  like i say as far as that's actually listening to the news it's mostly TV <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five o'clock to six thirty</TIMEX>
 		oh that seems like a long time for news but that's how long it is
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh seems like they have the local news and they have the world news
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and then uh my <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> i can hardly wait for it to come
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm you know i i just uh i would i i i'm not a morning <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> so i would begrudge the time it takes me in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX> to catch my <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> news
 	
 	
 		and um
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i get up just barely in time to get up get ready and get off to work and then at work i have no time to read the news
 	
 	
 		oh
 		yeah right once you get to work i wouldn't either huh-uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but i've always been a morning <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> to get up you know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and but i can't stay up <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">late at night</TIMEX> to watch the late news so  i guess that's why i watch it at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five o'clock</TIMEX>  but anyhow  well listen i guess that's about it then
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		okay
 	
 	
 		it's been nice talking to you <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tony</ENAMEX>
