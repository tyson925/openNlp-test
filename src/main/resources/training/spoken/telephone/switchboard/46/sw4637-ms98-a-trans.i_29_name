 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		uh do you have any particular um ideas about our funding of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> research
 	
 	
 		yes
 		yes i think it's important that we uh
 		either make a special tax for it or implement the money toward that away from other areas
 		it's going to be such an amazing
 		insurmountable insurmountable you can't even imagine the cost it's going to cost to take care of these people
 		and and if they can find a resource of course they can cut the pain and suffering but if anything the cost
 		they're going to save a well fortune just implementing that money toward that
 	
 	
 		do you think it's more important than <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> or something else simply because the the numbers are so large
 	
 	
 		yes i do
 		oh well cancer the numbers are larger
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		um however <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> has the opportunity to become to become larger than cancer within a very quick time
 	
 	
 		because my thought leads to you know i have uh school age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh i think a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a</NUMEX> a good amount of money ought to go to the education which they they doing seem to be doing
 	
 	
 		um-hum i i agree
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> because i think you want to stop it before it gets to you know it's not the kind of thing you can reverse if you've got to stop it before it starts
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		something inside inside me upsets me to think that there're there're lots of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> in in my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> there's a genetic disease
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		why aren't <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> making a stink about that and you know and curing you know making this gung ho rally to cure that
 	
 	
 		i think it's because the sheer numbers i really think it's that
 	
 	
 		it's a scare also
 	
 	
 		it is
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">uh AIDS</ENAMEX> is a major topic right now it's trendy
 		in the news it's in everybody's point of view
 		but until you've really worked with it and seen it
 		that's that's the difference it is it is
 	
 	
 		oh i'm sure it's devastating
 		and and there there is a real scare scare a real fear you don't know
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know how dangerous it could be i had answered a uh job ad for we have a local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> down here
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and they said they needed a lab <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assistant</ENAMEX> and i'm working part-time now i'm a substitute teacher
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh but you know i get called sporadically and they needed this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lab</ENAMEX> assistance in the neighborhood and said you didn't have to have experience i'm really an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX> but i figured oh you know i'll find out what it is
 		and she she very casually said well think about whether you want to this because there are <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">lab animals</ENAMEX> and blah blah blah and the
 		um you might be exposed to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> but you know you'd have gloves and this and that and it did make me flinch it did make me not want to do that
 	
 	
 		well i remember the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time i worked with an <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> i was terrified i have to admit it
 		and i know educationally wise everything i'm supposed to know
 	
 	
 		imagine how they feel
 		right
 	
 	
 		and it still scared me
 	
 	
 		sure but i get you know these these were lab <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> i'm not crazy about <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> to begin with i mean but here's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> and you can feel compassion for them
 	
 	
 		that's true but you'd be surprised how many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurses</ENAMEX> don't
 	
 	
 		oh i don't know
 	
 	
 		it
 		i'm not kidding i
 	
 	
 		yeah i guess it <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> will do anything you know just because it's a job and they have to make a salary but
 	
 	
 		i i work in a public a county <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> and uh well first of all most of those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurses</ENAMEX> there are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LVNs</ENAMEX> because the pay is bad for them
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and they don't they don't have many RNs and very few BSNs
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		the care is shoddy
 	
 	
 		the care is shoddy yes
 		uh the compassion is low <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the hours</TIMEX> are long and there's a lot of people
 		so they tend to isolate them and leave them
 		for a large amount
 	
 	
 		right yeah how can you feel when there's a sign on your door you know i is it
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		there there's usually a sign on the door saying quarantined or something you know or
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yes they're in isolation
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		they certainly are
 	
 	
 		i'm sure a big part of it is uh they they suffer mentally as well as physically
 	
 	
 		they definitely do they definitely do
 	
 	
 		yeah you know it it just when i when i see a headline that says that we're giving twenty <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">five billion</NUMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> because you know they need to eat better and then we've got so many problems at home
 	
 	
 		i know
 		and we our debt i i'm just so concerned
 	
 	
 		what where is this you know my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> says well they're printing up more you know i don't know where where is it coming from do they ask us
 	
 	
 		i know
 		where are they spending it i know
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		who who are i mean where are they spending this money you know
 	
 	
 		well i don't know how we could spend it when we owe so much i don't understand
 	
 	
 		me either
 	
 	
 		you know you would think it balances you know you don't have it you can't spend it but we seem to it's a mystery
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yes we do yes we do
 	
 	
 		uh so i guess you're saying you think we should spend more for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> research
 	
 	
 		um i
 	
 	
 		i'm not i don't really know what we are spending actually
 	
 	
 		uh that's exactly what i was going to say i don't really know how much we're spending it may be one of those things that takes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty years</TIMEX> to find anyway or fifty
 	
 	
 		well well i hate to think there's a you know it seems that anytime a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bureaucracy</ENAMEX> works on something they waste a lot of money on administration costs
 	
 	
 		oh i know
 	
 	
 		and a study of how to do this can cost <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">millions of dollars</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 		instead of just trying it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right right uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i don't know um
 	
 	
 		i imagine
