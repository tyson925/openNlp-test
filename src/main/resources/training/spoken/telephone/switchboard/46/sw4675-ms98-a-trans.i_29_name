 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		all righty
 	
 	
 		okay do you have a budget that you go on
 	
 	
 		yeah i sure do um i have it's pretty much a ledger sheet and i just write down
 		all my bills how much i'm going to have to pay and i do it per paycheck for me which is every other week uh i mean i include everything from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">groceries</ENAMEX> to insurance to car payments to credit card payments you know everything
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and it tends to work out pretty well that way i can anticipate you know a little better i usually try to guesstimate and then when the bill actually comes in i go ahead and fill in the actual amount
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		that way i know how much pocket change i'm going to have left at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the month</TIMEX> or at the end of the paycheck anyway
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so that works okay for me
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well my bills i usually know approximately how much they're going to be <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each month</TIMEX> they  are more or less just about the same you know
 	
 	
 		right
 		uh-huh same here
 	
 	
 		uh very seldom are they any different and then uh like for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">groceries</ENAMEX> and everything we try to put like
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two hundred</TIMEX> and fifty dollars in a little can in the kitchen
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and then that's what we use to buy the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">groceries</ENAMEX> with
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		and then we put our receipts in there you know and usually that's enough
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and um but i don't have any you know small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> to have anything extra come up you know like uh running to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> or something like that with them
 	
 	
 		right luckily i don't either i mean you know maybe my <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> would get sick but i mean usually that's not so much that it would throw me off
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah yeah right in fact i did have to take my <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vet</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the other day</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		but you so you know what i'm saying yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah that it's it's worse than having a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX> huh
 	
 	
 		i sometimes it can be sometimes it can be i guess the worst thing i've ever had come out is like <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> maintenance kinds of things
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but i do try to build in a little extra money <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each month</TIMEX> to to be able to do that type of thing so
 	
 	
 		yeah um i'm not working right now i worked for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P I E</ENAMEX> and then uh
 		they went bankrupt so i just went ahead and took my early pension
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but i only get that once a month
 	
 	
 		ooh that's tough
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">roommate</ENAMEX> only gets paid once a month
 	
 	
 		yeah so
 	
 	
 		and that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX>'s pretty lean generally speaking so
 	
 	
 		yeah so you know i really have to try to budget that i don't go over that amount you know each month
 	
 	
 		right i for for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> got paid once a month and and in ways i liked it because i could go ahead and pay all my bills at once
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		there's always <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one or two</NUMEX> stragglers that usually they were for me it worked out that they were the smaller ones
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but i would pay all of them at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> sitting and i would know okay you can go spend this much on groceries now and you get this much <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a week</TIMEX> and that is it
 	
 	
 		yeah right
 	
 	
 		and and that worked okay for me
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i don't know right now i i'm in the mode of trying to dig out of debt i think as everybody is and so
 	
 	
 		and
 		oh yeah right now it's terrible isn't it
 	
 	
 		it's yeah it's really bad but um it's going pretty well and i've got a real good plan mapped out here so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh i also like belong to a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">club</ENAMEX> because you know i used to belong to a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">club</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> i didn't
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		then so then naturally <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> comes along and that's puts you behind too you know so <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> now i have them taking out fifty dollars <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a month</TIMEX> out of my checking account for my <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> club
 	
 	
 		oh that's
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so i figure you know that's gonna help some
 	
 	
 		that'll cover your gifts come <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas time</TIMEX> that'll yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah right you know
 	
 	
 		that'd be good because yeah most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are spending <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three or four months</TIMEX> digging you know at least digging out after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> so
 	
 	
 		yeah right right
 		and i'm taking
 	
 	
 		yeah i i was pretty fortunate this <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> i didn't get in debt so
 	
 	
 		oh that's good i'm taking like um sewing lessons to try to learn how to sew better than what i can
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so i won't have to go out and buy the readymade clothes anymore
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh it's so rare you hear anybody doing that any longer
 	
 	
 		i know i even bought myself a Surger you know and i just love it i haven't learned everything to do on it yet but
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i figure that will help me save
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know
 	
 	
 		my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">um roommate</ENAMEX> does sew some and and um
 		i she hasn't sewed anything in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a long time</TIMEX> but i i'm sure that she could pick it up again my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> always sewed she tried to teach me when i was young but
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		not interested
 	
 	
 		yeah well see some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are and some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> aren't because i have some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sisters</ENAMEX> i have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sisters</ENAMEX> and none of those are really interested in sewing
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah but that's a real good way to save money though by doing that
 	
 	
 		yeah and then i can also you know do some crafts and sell those at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garage</ENAMEX> sales
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
