 
     		
 	
 		well <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harris</ENAMEX> what was your most recent woodworking project
 	
 	
 		
 
 		my most recent woodworking project was i made an oak trash can
 	
 	
 		oh all right
 		all right
 	
 	
 		it's the new thing around here is people
 		want trash cans which match their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen</ENAMEX> cabinets
 	
 	
 		oh that's rather clever i hadn't thought of that
 	
 	
 		so
 		
 
 		and i'm if the definition of a professional means you get paid for it then i am one
 	
 	
 		oh is that right
 	
 	
 		yeah i really am in the telecommunications business but you know
 		one has to do what you can do to make a buck
 	
 	
 		huh well maybe a small business of woodworking on the side then do you have a lot of woodworking tools
 	
 	
 		i got uh well your basic stuff your radial arm your table your drill press
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		what i don't do is i don't i don't turn
 	
 	
 		that that's almost a whole another world i think
 		well
 	
 	
 		you know it
 		you know i build boxes as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> say
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		well i subscribe to both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fine Home Building</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fine Woodworking</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		are you familiar with those
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i am i don't get either one i look through them at the uh at the newsstand and buy them on occasion
 		i get a
 		a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX> called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Workshop News</ENAMEX> and i get a uh
 		um let's see i can't read the side of it
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh Woodsmith</ENAMEX> i think it's called
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		it's a you know a
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</TIMEX> sort of brown paper type of type of thing
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah well the the thing i like about the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazines</ENAMEX> i mentioned is they're so inspirational
 	
 	
 		oh yeah oh i've looked through both of them you can just only afford to subscribe to so many
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that's right that's right i
 	
 	
 		there's an
 	
 	
 		i think i like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fine Home Building</ENAMEX> better
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		in terms uh one of my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">projects</ENAMEX> is adding molding to a rather plain house
 	
 	
 		uh yes
 		now there you can get upside down and backwards doing crown molding
 	
 	
 		that's right that's right
 	
 	
 		you know as soon as you get your head upside down and backwards you're fine
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that describes it perfectly
 	
 	
 		i made an armoire
 		recently for my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>'s store
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		and the top of it has curved crown molding
 	
 	
 		oh boy
 	
 	
 		that will
 		yeah uh-huh it sure did
 	
 	
 		even if you're an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineer</ENAMEX> by training that can be a little tricky can't it
 	
 	
 		well
 		what you had to it wasn't what i did was i made it up out of the crown molding around the top and the the tricky part was not making up the crown molding it was how did you cut it how did you miter the corners
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		i know
 		i know
 		i i've been through that uh do you do a lot of projects or is this is this just mostly a hobby
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		no i don't build it if somebody is not buying it
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		i mean uh i build a uh i have a stock English garden bench which i make
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		which i instead of making out of redwood which is really dear on the east coast
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		is i make it up out of your regularly old forty CPI pressure treated lumber
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and then paint it
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		which saves on the cost
 	
 	
 		uh-huh we have a lot of those at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> where i work and i think they're made out of teak
 	
 	
 		yeah teak is awfully expensive but the the thing about teak is you can't set it on the ground
 		you have to set it like on flagstone or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">concrete</ENAMEX> or something
 	
 	
 		does it whit too badly or what
 	
 	
 		yeah it's just not made for direct ground contact it pulls the  it pulls the oil right out of it
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		it it's all right outside if you go out <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every year</TIMEX> and you know oil it
 		but you know the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the old</TIMEX> green pressure treated you can ignore it if the paint falls off it's still not going to hurt the wood
 	
 	
 		sure
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know the paint's only just to cover up the fact it's green
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		it sounds like you're much more of a woodworker than i am i just kind of dabble in it i have done some refinishing
 	
 	
 		oh oh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		of antiques and semi-antiques
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and a little bit of repair work on that sort of thing
 	
 	
 		yeah i don't do a whole lot of that i've done some
 		i one nice thing about living in this area is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smithsonian</ENAMEX> nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smithsonian</ENAMEX> is nearby
