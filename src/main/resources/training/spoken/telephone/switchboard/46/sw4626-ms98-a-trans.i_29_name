 
     		
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		
 
 		how are you you want to go ahead and start talking about whether you budget
 	
 	
 		yes yeah well i i i i feel like um
 		i am from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mars</ENAMEX> i mean i'm <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fifty years old</TIMEX> and uh i've been divorced for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">um eighteen years</TIMEX> but i've <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> and all but i uh i i've never had a budget and i don't uh
 		i don't do any planning and i don't know  i don't uh
 		uh
 		i don't have
 		a long-term financial plan and i don't try to control my expenses
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but i'm i'm glad you're a stranger
 	
 	
 		that sounds kind of like me
 	
 	
 		but really i'm i'm in a happy i i well i'm curious how other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> live uh so maybe we should start with you  what do you do
 	
 	
 		about the same thing  yeah
 	
 	
 		really
 		oh maybe they're going to arrest us both
 	
 	
 		i'm even even in worse shape because i have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
 		and uh we live from hand to mouth we hope that there's enough money at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the month</TIMEX> to pay for the bills and if there's not then we try to  due for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next month</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> a couple of times we've tried some things and they worked but i'm not disciplined enough
 		to keep doing it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		the best program we ever had is at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the beginning of the month</TIMEX> we took and uh took my check and divided it out into envelopes
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and then paid for the expenses out of that envelope and when the envelope was empty  then you didn't have any more money to spend in that area
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and that worked out real well cause we didn't have to keep writing down what we'd spent
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it was just that when that was empty you knew you were out of money
 		and we did that pretty successfully for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about three months</TIMEX> and then we started borrowing from one envelope to  put it in the other envelope and  in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about two months</TIMEX> we were back to doing the same thing we always do
 	
 	
 		huh the um i had a part-time job around oh gosh fifteen <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago seventy six</TIMEX>
 		and uh
 		uh this was a sort of a career shift at the time and so i was willing to take a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> time job to do that and i actually did my bank account would uh i had i i kept bouncing checks just at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the month</TIMEX>
 		but i i had miscalculated i well i didn't keep a balance  it's one of the problems i never had to in the past i always kept plenty of money in my checking account but when you're only earning half the salary
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		even though i wasn't spending much money i sometimes would just things would get to tight
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> and sometimes what i would do is keep a piece of paper in my wallet
 		and every time i uh i spent money i mean cash mostly i would uh write it down so i could see at the end of a month how much i spent on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> so i could do better planning
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but i would forget to write the things down and it it that i i don't know if i ever went as far as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three months</TIMEX> or not  in in keeping that kind of data i certainly haven't done that in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixteen years</TIMEX> or whatever
 	
 	
 		i even find now like with the automatic tellers i'll go take money out of that and then i forget to take that out of my checking account
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so i i i leave a little bit of a slush fund in my checking account
 		and i figure that so the balance showing in the checking account is always somewhat different that what's really there
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i figure that gives me room for the mistakes i make
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		the uh i i i have to say that let's see at this point on i don't run out of money um and it uh
 		and and i don't i mean someday if i were to get remarried i might want to buy a house which requires lots of money which i don't have
 		and i i i i think my strategy if if i may is is is is to is to not spend money i mean i don't have expensive tastes
 		i don't go out i mean i buy a car well the last <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> i got rid of i'd had it was nineteen years old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people people</ENAMEX> were embarrassed for me i mean it was it was a good car and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 		it was still running
 	
 	
 		oh it was great my my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mechanics</ENAMEX> loved it because it was an old it was a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">sixty five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buick</ENAMEX> and it just wouldn't stop
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">um</ENAMEX> and it i i just didn't feel the need for a new car it isn't like i couldn't afford one
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> and now i mean i i don't uh
 		i tend to eat expensive food i mean i don't mind buying a good steak but for me
 		i only do that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every week</TIMEX> or um without even i mean maybe once a month
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i mean you buy a a tenderloin steak it costs outrageous like twelve <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">dollars</NUMEX> a pound you buy a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a less than half</NUMEX> a pound so it's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">seven dollars</NUMEX> to me i realize if you have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> you're not going to run out and do that
 	
 	
 		not very often
 	
 	
 		but but i'm just i'm just saying as a single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> that's that's a drop in the bucket and so if you're extravagant on how you buy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> it doesn't add up if you're buying mean if you're not going to super expensive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> which i don't care to go to
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		so so that's i think one of the reasons i don't need to budget is that i don't have i don't i don't have to hold myself back from buying that expensive thing because i can't afford it because i'm not interested in that expensive thing
