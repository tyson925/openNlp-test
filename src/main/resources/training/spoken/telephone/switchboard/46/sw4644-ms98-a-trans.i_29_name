 		and i think large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporations</ENAMEX> can give better benefits than small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporations</ENAMEX> because
 		right now i'm working for a very small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporation</ENAMEX> where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">owner</ENAMEX> is right there and uh there's a lot of profit that's coming in but when it comes to uh small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporations</ENAMEX> they seem to
 		pocket it a little bit quick quickly or whatever or however you wanna say it
 		and uh
 		the benefits aren't as great as when i worked for a big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporation</ENAMEX> because the big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporations</ENAMEX> seem to look at its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> and say
 		okay we've got this amount of money let's put into this plan this plan you got <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Four O One K</ENAMEX> plans you have uh better vacation plans uh you have just
 		in general maternity leave plans that that kind of thing big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporations</ENAMEX> are able to do that versus
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporations</ENAMEX> uh
 		you know they just don't have the money or just uh feel that there isn't a need for it
 		so i've worked for both big and small so i've had a chance to kind of take a look at uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pros</ENAMEX> and cons of both
 	
 	
 		right
 		well i've worked for uh well i worked for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H and R Block</ENAMEX> here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Massachusetts</ENAMEX> for awhile and the only they even hate to give out unemployment
 	
 	
 		sure
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		sure um-hum
 	
 	
 		at the end of tax <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX> because they you know they're fairly even though they're a large scale <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> they're very the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> are very small
 	
 	
 		
 
 		sure
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and now i work for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Framingham</ENAMEX> school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> uh school system because i'm a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> and uh we have much better benefits
 	
 	
 		uh-huh sure
 	
 	
 		you know in the system we have a good pension plan um let me see we have a profit sharing plan to a degree
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		that's pretty good for you know being a a school district type program
 	
 	
 		right and we have the eye glasses the health care and the whole kit and caboodle because what they did is they threw the all the town <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> in together
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		wow
 		that's extremely good
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		because like like the small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporation</ENAMEX> that i work for there's no pension plan there's no type of uh savings of any sort that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> will reimburse you for
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		there's really i think you're allowed so many times uh i think <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two or three days a week a year</TIMEX> it's not accumulative type of sick leave
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		um you know things like that so i've been looking at big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporations</ENAMEX> and saying the big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporation</ENAMEX> that i've worked for in the past had the pension plans had the big health
 		health care uh you had your insurance and you didn't have to pay in as much as if you go to a a very small place
 		um they don't have as good as insurance packages as big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporations</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		right the only trouble we've had here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Massachusetts</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> and state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> have run into problem especially the retired ones my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>'s retired from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Framingham</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		sure
 	
 	
 		and he said that they haven't gotten a a cost of living raise in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">over five years</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		no yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		and he said that's the only thing that really stinks as far as being retired and but i hear that bill is in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> right now and it's
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		sure sure
 	
 	
 		hopefully will go through
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		but um you know i think the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> are at where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> isn't just the school system and not just the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> they took in the whole town plus all you know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		is it a union
 	
 	
 		uh we have the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> union which helps out a lot but the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Framingham</ENAMEX> pays the benefits and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		oh that's pretty good
 	
 	
 		that's all the town <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> water and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sewer</ENAMEX> and where it's a very large <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> it's actually should be a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> but they kept it a town
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		sure
 	
 	
 		um where it's extremely large they were able to offer a little bit more
 		which was really great because we don't have to pay a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mayor</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh yeah yeah i know what you mean and that's true i mean yeah it it does end up being quite a bit when you have to hire somebody for that position sure
 	
 	
 		right because most of our you know the town <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> as far as uh electoral <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">positions</ENAMEX> are part time
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so it works out good because we reap the benefits of it and um
 	
 	
 		sure
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but as far as shopping for a job i'd rather shop for the benefits than the salary
 	
 	
 		well that's it you know and and i've kind of looked around uh at that uh too because uh salary wise i don't think i'm making as much with a big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporation</ENAMEX> because i think when you look at big corps
 		or large i'm talking like huge <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> like <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX>
 		um i'm <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Honeywell</ENAMEX> uh uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texas Instruments</ENAMEX>  i know <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that are that have vacation times and benefits benefits that
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i wouldn't even dream of in this small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporation</ENAMEX> you bring it up to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">owner</ENAMEX> and it's like come on you know partly it's because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">owner</ENAMEX> wants to keep getting richer and richer
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and and of course when it's a small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporation</ENAMEX> it also wants to expand so that money's spent
 		in a
