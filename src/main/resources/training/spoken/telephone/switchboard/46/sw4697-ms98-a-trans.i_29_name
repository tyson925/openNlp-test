 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well the the question was talking about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">juries</ENAMEX> and um one of the things i thought about was on a lot of the drunk cases that they were having that especially for repeat offenders
 		that um maybe there should be stiffer penalties for those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who come back again and again
 		um so that um a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> i think would be the most appropriate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> to uh to be able to sentence somebody since they do it over and over again <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		right i i kind of agree with that because i think in some cases uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jury</ENAMEX> may not even have the information about other crimes the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> has committed
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh i i think that in some cases that's considered to prejudice the current case
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		so a a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> you're right should have the whole dossier of the criminal there and if they're judged guilty would probably be in a better <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prison</ENAMEX> position to give an appropriate uh sentencing
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah see i agree with you um
 		one thing i heard was this where they have instead of going to the regular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> they have a a mock court i mean it's supposed to be all legal and everything uh you go and you present your case the other side presents their case and you're done with it
 		it's almost like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Night Court</ENAMEX> we see on TV um and um but it's not that we have uh such it didn't backlog or all of the uh the cases that are uh all ready pending
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um so i that was one thing i thought about that would be really neat if we could do it that way
 	
 	
 		in other words not not there would be some types of crimes for which you're not guaranteed a jury trial
 	
 	
 		yes yes Now
 	
 	
 		i i i don't there's there's a point on which we don't agree i would tend myself to say that we should continue to guarantee a jury trial for criminal cases anytime a anytime a
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> wants <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> and i usually it's the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defendant</ENAMEX> i guess that wants to have the jury hear the case
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		sure
 	
 	
 		so i'm i'm not out for  streamlining things to the point where we uh take that you know that would require a change in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Bill of Rights</ENAMEX> i believe and so
 	
 	
 		oh yes and and i wasn't i didn't mean that  i i didn't mean that no because i mean gee <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whiz</ENAMEX> if i was uh uh didn't have that right you know not to have a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jury</ENAMEX> that oh yes i would feel um
 	
 	
 		oh oh okay
 	
 	
 		you're right that my civil rights had been violated but i meant for some when both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> agreed that yes we're going to have a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> here we're not going to have a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jury</ENAMEX> you know let's get it over with sort of like <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> accidents you know
 	
 	
 		right well i think that's all ready possible i think that you can waive the right to a jury trial uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right right
 	
 	
 		yeah so i agree that that should be encouraged you know <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> should know that that's an option just in case they feel they have to have a jury trial but i think most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> do a pretty good job of making that evident to
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clients</ENAMEX> unless they feel they can you know tweak a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jury</ENAMEX> into  perhaps
 	
 	
 		right giving a different sentence
 	
 	
 		giving a different sentence or possibly if it's a civil case giving higher uh
 		you know awards of money or something since usually the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> get a percentage of the the award
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		the take right right
 	
 	
 		yeah and i suspect it in cases like i guess we were supposed to be doing criminals though rather than civil is that right
 	
 	
 		well i i it we're at liberty to to talk and and meander as long as it's all on the same theme um-hum
 	
 	
 		yeah well uh um in the case of civil civil uh things i think maybe the
 		the use of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jury</ENAMEX> is very often to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX>'s advantage and i think that may be where jury
 		use is overdone you know i mean there are cases where they could be settled maybe out of court a little more efficiently but the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> are really
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		uh it's to their advantage to play to as big an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> as possible so uh i was wondering too if they were thinking about the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> making awards in civil cases
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		not just sentencing in in a criminal cases uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i'm not so sure i'm in favor of that but i am in favor of it for criminal cases so there's a difference of my view there for those two
 	
 	
 		right right
 		yeah but well you can tell i haven't been in too many <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">juries judges chambers</ENAMEX> or anything like that  and well i was called once when i was nineteen and um
 	
 	
 		have you ever had to serve jury duty
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but i was doing so many other things that they took took pity on me and i was doing school and things like that they they let me out and i've never had to it since and that was almost <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty years ago</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh</ENAMEX> it it isn't sort of amazed me they first caught up with me for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time in uh that would have been about uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty years</TIMEX> too um uh just <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> and
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh the case i heard was a criminal case and it seemed it really trivial it involved <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bicycles</ENAMEX> we didn't do the sentencing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> did
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		huh
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		how interesting
 	
 	
 		we'd we uh rendered a verdict and then the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> was the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to do the sentencing
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and that was here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wisconsin</ENAMEX>
 		so i i don't know if that varies from state to state or if it varies
