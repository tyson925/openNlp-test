 
     		
 	
 		is crime a problem in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arlington</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh actually we live out in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gainesville Virginia</ENAMEX> and uh my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> is originally from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bronx</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so for the longest time we didn't have any any kind of crime protection on our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> at all because we lived way out in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> here
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh then you know over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</TIMEX> we visited her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX> and her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX> have probably the most impressive crime reduction system i've ever seen on any house you know they have grates across every single window
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		they have probably <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three or four</NUMEX> dead bolts on every door
 		um just uh an amazing array of um you know sort of security measures on their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> i mean it's harder to get into their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> than it is probably  a lot of minimum security prisons
 	
 	
 		well huh
 	
 	
 		so anyway now she's turning our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> into sort of the same thing  we have uh we have like grates on the on the uh door on the basement windows even though there's very little crime in this area
 	
 	
 		huh
 		well
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and we just had a a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> come out a locksmith come out and put all those on as well as sort of reinforce all of our dead bolts and uh put new locks in on some doors and fix our <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> doors up so that they were
 		you know secure
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		yeah it it's too bad you mentioned uh your in-laws place as as being like a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prison</ENAMEX> in sense of hard to get into or out of or whatever
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that's what crime is doing in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> it's turning those that live in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> into prisoners
 	
 	
 		yeah what's it like in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh actually i'm in a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">suburb</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> where it's
 		safer in general than it is in the big city
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it um
 		i think it's like most <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> and that is the high crime areas are the
 		ones where there's more poverty
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		the you know that  there's always <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> part of town
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh whether it's the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bronx</ENAMEX> or whether it's a certain area in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> or whatever
 		uh
 		i i think that's where the crime is concentrated but gosh we just there was just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> over in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fort Worth</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> was killed and her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> was uh badly injured
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and they've charged the uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX>
 		with hiring <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of her teenage <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> to kill her
 	
 	
 		oh man
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> and stuff yeah
 	
 	
 		man incredible
 	
 	
 		isn't that incredible and i mean uh that that's crime that's
 		that you don't usually think about i mean you if you if you're going to carry on a conversation about crime you know you think of the hardened criminal that keeps
 		uh
 		attacking attacking again and again if you will whether you know depending on what his game is maybe it's an armed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">robber</ENAMEX> who does it all the time but this is uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		yeah it's clearly i i mean it's they're not in category of business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">criminals</ENAMEX> i mean there's
 		there's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">criminals</ENAMEX> who are in it just because that's their business you know  i mean that's their trade essentially and
 	
 	
 		oh yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		you know then there's then there's the really random acts of violence we actually had a a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> who was very close to our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX> which sort of inspired my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> to you know beef up our own security measures here
 		uh she was a couple of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> away and her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> travels a lot and is gone you know for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX> on end
 		and she was upstairs with her uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> and heard somebody say <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">hello hello</ENAMEX> from downstairs
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so she immediately calls 911
 		and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Prince William</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">County</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> come over and of course the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> kept her on the phone the whole time which i thought was a really good security measure because
 		you know if you can get <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">911</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gainesville Virginia</ENAMEX> you know  you're probably you know i mean it's probably a pretty effective thing you know
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um so anyway the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> showed up and they told her the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> on the phone told her to run you know take the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> and run downstairs and to let the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> in because they were at her front door
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and so she did that and when she opened the front door she'd just bought this new <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Shepherd puppy</ENAMEX> which had apparently you know uh gone all over the floor
 		so the the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">policeman</ENAMEX> stepped into the front door and actually started sliding around on you know the dog mess
 	
 	
 		oh no
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and she yelled simultaneously yelled look out
 		which the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">policeman</ENAMEX> thought was like somebody's about to shoot me
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so you know he's like spinning around in this stuff you know i mean it's a pretty comical scene but anyway when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> finally regained his balance you know he just like get out of house <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX> and stop trying to help me
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but anyway later on it's it's gonna it's uh she they didn't find anything i mean apparently you know if the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> came in he ran out and and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> tried to convince her that it was the dog playing with the remote control on the TV which just doesn't make any sense at all
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		too the odds of that are just really unlikely but i actually went over
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about a week later</TIMEX> he was back home and she was on travel and he locked himself out and i went over and within i would say about <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five seconds</TIMEX> got into their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garage</ENAMEX> door
 	
 	
 		oh ho
