 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		actually i don't have much recent experience uh but
 		i have done uh a variety of fishing probably the most favorite uh was when i was of youth
 		um probably in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the ages ten</TIMEX> to fifteen when i went out with my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> uh we lived in
 		we lived on the uh southeast <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">coast of Florida</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about a mile</NUMEX> from the ocean we went out
 		off the coast of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fort Lauderdale Miami</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		in uh small <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> with a small outboard motor
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		went out <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a mile two miles three miles</NUMEX> sometimes and bottom fished
 		and uh
 		and got lots of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> very rapidly basically went out to a reef and uh
 		which probably about
 		oh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> fathoms or something like that and uh
 		and we just pull up <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> usually pull up <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> as fast as you could let your line down
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and sometimes uh had some fun uh with trigger <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> that would follow other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> up and then
 		then you'd catch the trigger fish right at the surface
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">occasional shark</ENAMEX> or an occasional octopus things of that nature but
 	
 	
 		yeah that must have been neat with octopus
 	
 	
 		yeah well that was pretty rare you know but every once in a while you'd get something like that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah most of  i haven't really done any like
 		like you said in awhile it's uh
 		most of my favorite fishing was before i came in the service and that was trout fishing up in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wyoming</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i see
 	
 	
 		and we went out to a lot of lakes and the streams and stuff and went fishing
 		i did some fly fishing and stuff in the streams and that that's pretty fun doing fly fishing
 	
 	
 		now where do you do uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">trout</ENAMEX> fishing in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wyoming</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		a lot of most of the lakes up there have rainbow <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">trout</ENAMEX> in them or <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">brook trout</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i see so you would fish in the lake
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and the fly fishing is in the stream or what
 	
 	
 		yeah in the in the stream or a river
 		you know uh
 		what if you got a pretty good if you know it has to be probably knee deep or a little deeper for you know in a creek before you can really do any good fishing
 	
 	
 		um
 		you <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX> or do you wade
 	
 	
 		a lot of times just <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> from the bank
 		um unless you get a good
 		spot spot in the corner you can kind of wade out a little bit but most of my fishing was done from the bank
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		but it it was pretty fun uh
 		i've caught a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">three four pound</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">trout</ENAMEX> before and that's pretty good size trout
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		um i've caught some
 		we got <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> reservoir up there that has some walleye in it
 		and i caught some of them
 	
 	
 		where abouts in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wyoming</ENAMEX> is this
 	
 	
 		uh up near <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Devil's Tower</ENAMEX> northeast corner
 	
 	
 		i see
 	
 	
 		uh
 		and
 		oh we went to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> where my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandfather</ENAMEX> lives we went out and did some uh
 		fishing out in the ocean so that was pretty neat too
 	
 	
 		where abouts is this
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">uh Sarasota</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i see that's quite different from the east coast the the the uh gulf coast uh you have to go out like maybe <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">twenty miles</NUMEX> before you get more than knee deep almost
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		whereas on the east coast uh you go out a mile and you're already uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five ten</NUMEX> fathoms down
 	
 	
 		yeah it it was it's pretty good though you know some of the bays are you know a little deep you know where they come in and stuff but
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		uh
 		it it was uh
 		an experience you know because he had his own boat
 	
 	
 		so what did you what did you get there off <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sarasota</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh i'm not really sure what they called it
 		uh
 		i don't even remember it's been such a long time what i was catching
 	
 	
 		
 
 		have you ever been sport fishing
 	
 	
 		no i haven't
 	
 	
 		i'd like to do that sometime i've never been sport fishing the closest i've come is to is uh go out on party <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> drift fishing
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah which is pretty nice we did that in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Jersey</ENAMEX> not too many <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX> and uh did it just at the right time and we got into
 		just <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> of blue <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> big ones about they each <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> weighed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about ten</NUMEX> pounds
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know they were about like uh <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">three four feet</NUMEX> long
 	
 	
 		oh that pretty good size
 	
 	
 		oh yeah yeah that was really uh really i guess they may be <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about three feet</NUMEX> long not <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> but um um that was something they really fought like
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you like nothing nothing else i'd ever had
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i've watched a lot of them sport fishing things on TV you know where they're out in the deep sea fishing
 	
 	
 		hm
