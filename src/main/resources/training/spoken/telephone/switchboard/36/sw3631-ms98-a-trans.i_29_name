 
     		
 	
 		you say you taught <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> for a while
 	
 	
 		yes it's been <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">some years ago</TIMEX> i haven't taught in the last <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty years</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh what grades did you teach
 	
 	
 		i taught <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about half</NUMEX> the time at the high school level and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about half</NUMEX> the time at the junior college level
 	
 	
 		okay uh and what general subjects
 	
 	
 		um business subjects
 	
 	
 		okay okay
 	
 	
 		do you have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> in school
 	
 	
 		uh not yet uh my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">first son</ENAMEX> is uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about two months old</TIMEX> now
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		none of them presently going into college
 		um
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		do you see anything in particular do you see you feel is wrong about the school system the way it's running now
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		well other than the fact that it it's not difficult enough and it doesn't last us long enough during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the school year</TIMEX>
 		uh i one of the the big errors uh that was made over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</TIMEX> is passing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> along when they hadn't really completed the get grade that they were in
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and allowing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">graduate</ENAMEX> from high school who couldn't read and write
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and cipher
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yes
 	
 	
 		oh
 		when i taught at the uh junior college level
 		um
 		i taught uh business law at the sophomore level and we were on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the quarter</TIMEX> system so they had this was the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last two quarters</TIMEX> in the sophomore year so they had to
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		think up something for me to teach at the uh front end of the in the fall
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		so i taught a little course called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> machines now if you keep in mind this was long before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the days</TIMEX> of the hand held computer calculator
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		so we started off with a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> key adding machine
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		uh ah one of the first problems was to add <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">three tenths</NUMEX>
 		and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty four</TIMEX> hundredths
 		and invariably a substantial proportion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> would come up with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twenty seven</NUMEX> hundredths
 		so i would have to launch into a discussion of common denominator and explain that every figure that was entered into that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> key adding machine with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> decimal places
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		was a number divided by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred and</NUMEX> in order to add <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">three tenths</NUMEX> to anything it had to be changed to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> hundredths
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh the only criterion for getting into the junior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">college</ENAMEX> where i taught was being eighteen years of age uh having a high school diploma was not a prerequisite it was for some of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the curricula</TIMEX> but it wasn't for the business curriculum
 	
 	
 		yes
 		huh
 	
 	
 		so so that's
 	
 	
 		not not even a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GED</ENAMEX> was required
 	
 	
 		i beg your pardon
 	
 	
 		a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GED</ENAMEX> wan't even required or was that available yet
 	
 	
 		uh no it was not at that time uh to take courses all you had to be with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eighteen years</TIMEX> of age
 	
 	
 		huh
 		
  
 	
 	
 		uh so uh
 		the the new math i think ruined our math uh i was teaching at the high school level when it was being introduced to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">seventh</NUMEX> grade
 		and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">eighth</NUMEX> grade and uh i went to a lecture and the math <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> said well we used to teach
 		business arithmetic at the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">seventh</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">eighth</NUMEX> grade level but now we're going to teach the new math like how to to count in the binary counting system
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh uh the base twelve and that sort of thing and uh we're gonna teach the theory of mathematics and never mind percentage
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yes
 	
 	
 		so um
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		i i checked my my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> was uh let's see when would he have been in <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">eighth</NUMEX> grade about oh in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the middle sixties</TIMEX> he would have been in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">eighth</NUMEX> grade and i checked his <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">eighth</NUMEX> grade math book
 	
 	
 		so they try to teach a concept
 		
  
 	
 	
 		and uh there were no percentage there were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> pages devoted to percentage and ratio and proportion
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and in in his algebra book there were no fractions no percentages and course he proceeded on to geometry
 		and um that sort of thing fortunately my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> have a very high aptitude in math
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		but uh there's a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a</NUMEX> a great <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> out there that does not
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		and uh so i went through this
 		uh lecture of counting in the decimal counting system
 		and i said if this doesn't make sense to you memorize it
 		and learn your <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-doms
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		because it's a percentage world out there
 	
 	
 		oh yeah yes
