 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		our <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">home</ENAMEX>'s a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> story home and
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		there's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about half</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> in our neighborhood that are ramblers that are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> stories
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		is yours a split entry
 	
 	
 		no no it's just a
 	
 	
 		no it's a
 	
 	
 		it's a regular <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> story all the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedrooms</ENAMEX> are upstairs and the and everything else is downstairs the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">basement</ENAMEX> is
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		unfinished now you you live in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mantua</ENAMEX> don't you
 	
 	
 		right yes uh we live in a ours is a little  um
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		ours the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> is fairly new in fact we were the very <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> home on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> and we've lived here <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">almost nine years</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh is that right
 	
 	
 		yes and so we were we were the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> and um
 		and i we don't have a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garage</ENAMEX> or and the and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">basement</ENAMEX> is not finished in fact we're just trying to
 		review our options right now and decide whether we want to finish the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">basement</ENAMEX> and add on a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garage</ENAMEX> or whether we're going to find something else or
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		gee we're just growing out of it
 	
 	
 		did you build the house
 	
 	
 		yes yes we did it it was new and um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		there's a variety of of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> along our street in fact next door to us is a log cabin home
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yes and it's it's just beautiful inside it's
 	
 	
 		do you like it
 	
 	
 		i do but if i think if i had a log cabin i'd want it to be
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cabin type home</ENAMEX> rather than a
 	
 	
 		oh rather than your personal residence
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah rather than something i went to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX> and i and i would want it on a different setting than you know a row of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> it's
 	
 	
 		something
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's beautiful inside but it to me it looks just a bit out of place
 	
 	
 		yeah we've got a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> that wants to build a log <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cabin</ENAMEX> in this neighborhood and we have some uh protective covenants
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh
 		oh yes
 	
 	
 		and they've really got into kind of some well it's kind of been a messy situation it's
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		actually gotten down to lawsuits and these are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that are you know
 	
 	
 		oh has it
 	
 	
 		in
 	
 	
 		oh that's
 	
 	
 		see each other every <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> and then they're suing each other it's not it's not a good situation
 	
 	
 		oh dear
 		
 
 		oh dear  now why did they want to build a log they just that's what they prefer huh
 	
 	
 		well it's it's a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a single gal</NUMEX> that uh well she's divorced and
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		uh think they have they're pretty actually uh good price per square foot
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh think she's thinking that would be a good economical way to get a get the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> that she likes at
 	
 	
 		oh oh that's yeah because apparently they save quite a bit when you put them together from the kit or or however they come
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah i i'm not sure
 		it's it's been a really controversy a controversy
 	
 	
 		oh dear so is she going to be able to build to build it do you think
 	
 	
 		not so far no because the the restrictive covenants provide to the
 	
 	
 		not so far
 	
 	
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the uh covenants is uh curiously enough uh that it has to be in harmony with the existing structures
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so when the you know when the copy  it doesn't look like the other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> it kind that's one thing item that has to occur in our neighborhood
 	
 	
 		right
 		
 
 		huh well that is interesting
 	
 	
 		we have to have uh a lot of uh
 		
 
 		if you don't have uh brick on it for example they're a little bit hard on you
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		like you have a certain amount brick and a certain amount uh some other material siding or
 	
 	
 		does it have to be uh a certain square footage or a certain price
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">stucco</ENAMEX>
 		uh i think there is a minimum square footage i'm not sure what it is
 	
 	
 		is there
 		oh we've we've been looking around at different pieces of land and have found a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple</TIMEX> that that had the minimum square footage
 	
 	
 		oh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know requirement but um
 		huh that's interesting that the other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> along our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> are like you say some are ramblers and some are the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> story so
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but ours ours is the smallest <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> on the road
 		
 
 	
 	
 		ours is you know our subdivision is really only about seventy homes
 	
 	
 		so
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and uh our street is uh the nicest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> are on our street i will say that not uh being boastful but i think our street does have the nicer homes
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 		well that's good
 	
 	
 		we border uh
 		well just on the other side the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> across our street uh from ours are the probably the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">nicer homes</ENAMEX> because they border on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">golf course</ENAMEX> and they have a creek that runs through their backyard
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh
 		oh that's nice
 	
 	
 		yeah but uh
 	
 	
 		that is nice now did you build you built yours
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah we've been in it <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six years</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh oh did you do the contracting yourself or did you hire a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">contractor</ENAMEX> or
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		we had a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">contractor</ENAMEX> come and do that uh
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		i really don't know much about home construction i well i know a little bit i did a little bit of work in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> sometimes just doing some framing but
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i don't know when you got a full time job and a family you really don't have the time
 	
 	
 		that's right it takes it takes did you finish your basement yourself or
 	
 	
 		no i haven't finished it yet
 	
 	
 		oh you haven't finished it
 	
 	
 		but see our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">upstairs</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> bedrooms
 	
 	
 		oh you don't need it yet then do you
