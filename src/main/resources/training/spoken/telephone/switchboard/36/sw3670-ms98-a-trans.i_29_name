 
     		
 	
 		start first
 	
 	
 		
 
 		sure i guess
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i'm trying to think do we pay too much taxes uh uh well i it it certainly seems like it i don't know you know i i i'm not up in the uh in in the high end brackets myself and so
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i can just imagine how bad that would hurt i remember at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> point when my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> was paying uh nearly <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">nearly sixty percent</NUMEX> tax tax bracket and that was just you know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it was killing him
 	
 	
 		yeah and i think that's that's basically my standpoint too is my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> and i've talked about this a lot and i just personally i think it's kind of i don't know we pay a lot
 		um sometimes i I know that it's not used very wisely
 		and i think the big thing for me and what my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> has said is we pay a lot but it's worth it to live in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> i guess for our freedom
 	
 	
 		yeah uh i mean other places pay more and you know so you can look at some place like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sweden</ENAMEX> and you know they they almost all give like seventy percent of their income to the government
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		right
 	
 	
 		um they get some different things out of it though uh i don't know i i'm not i'm not terribly pleased with the distribution of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">of</NUMEX> of it and i think we we spend entirely too much on defense
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		right
 	
 	
 		um although i work in in sort of hi tech industry type thing and and and which in large part survives on on uh on defense contracting you know so
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so i mean i kind of biting the hand that feeds you if you really wanna
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		sorry cutting it hard but um
 		i don't know you know it seems like it seems like we ought to be able to get a little bit uh things ought to be a little bit more efficiently run and i i i and i think that we could get by without continually raising taxes
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		absolutely
 	
 	
 		you know i mean i think i think we're at a point where you know it's it's taxes are a burden but their you know um services come out of it and and things are important but on the other hand
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know they just can't continue to rise forever and the deficit can't continue to grow
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know there's there's got to be some point where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> sit down and say okay you know this is enough income to give government services at and we need to make sure we give good government service at this point and you know and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		and the sad thing i think personally you know i don't mind paying so much taxes if i'm getting what's due
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but i think a lot of times what happens is you get into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government system</ENAMEX> and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> works for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> in some ways and he works a lot with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who are paid by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> and there are so many things to quote unquote protect the employee
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that you know you're you're you're not getting what you're paying for a lot of times whereas in any other business situation it'd be see you you know
 	
 	
 		right right you know there there there isn't there isn't the business cycle where where where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> gets uh gets chopped down you know i mean and they they don't go through a restructuring you you know even <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> going through a cutbacks right and and you know <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> just doesn't do it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know and <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">and and</ENAMEX> and it's because of in part you know necessary protections for the worker
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but but on the other hand there's you know you you you've got to plan them in the real world also you know
 	
 	
 		yeah and you got to walk that fine line i think one of the things that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> really could could save a lot of money on is is you know when it's for example in defense spending when it's something that you can use like an ashtray you know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		just go buy it at a store my gosh and  or buy it from a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX> instead of having it made and have to form the mold and everything you know
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		right
 	
 	
 		and granted there's other things for example that you know a microwave or something if you're underwater you'd have to have some specific specifications but
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but just to work out with our tax money you know watch where is it going to be best used and how is it going to be most effective cost wise
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right yeah i mean i think i think you you know in general i'm i'm pretty pleased with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> with you know with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> and and a lot of the things that work here i mean
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		it there there's lots of things that don't quite work right and um but if you've ever spent <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">any time</TIMEX> in other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> you realize
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		that that its all a relative issue issue you know everywhere everywhere things don't work right and some places they really don't work right and here they they pretty much work right you know
 	
 	
 		yep
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um but i think you know i mean if if things are gonna things that need to change are things that that need to be sort of restructuring you know maybe market orientation a little bit more and and things like what you're talking about um
 	
 	
 		right
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know putting a little bit more of the pressures of the of the business pressures that are normal that are on everybody else on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> and uh so that we get a little bit more out of the tax dollars and a little bit
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah
 		and i agree with you there i think you know there there's nothing in my opinion from what i've seen and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> i've worked with some other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> and from our own <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> that
 		that would ever take the place of the freedoms and the the the things that we have here for me i you know i i guess when it comes right down to it if it was living in a place
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> that are really struggling both with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> and with economics i would prefer to pay my extra tax money here and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and have things the way they are
 	
 	
 		yeah i i think my my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>'s from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brazil</ENAMEX> and i've spent a fair amount of time there and and you wanna see a government system that just doesn't work you know i mean it's just its incredible its just
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		entirely corrupt they have uh you know something like uh seventy <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">five percent</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">sixty five percent</NUMEX> of the able bodied <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> are employed by the government
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know and so that leaves everybody else you know this other small
