 
     		
 	
 		are you in the market for a new car
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um well actually <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about six months ago</TIMEX> we were uh but it was kind of a different type deal we had uh a large conversion <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">van</ENAMEX> that and we're looking to sell it too
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		uh to get a smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>  but but when i was looking for the van we were looking around quite a bit
 	
 	
 		uh-huh oh you need to  down
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh</ENAMEX> and did you were you happy with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">van</ENAMEX> you found
 	
 	
 		oh yeah yeah as a matter of fact the reason we sold the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">van</ENAMEX> was just so that my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> could stay home with our <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> now
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so we got rid of that big payment and so now she now she's a stay at home mom
 	
 	
 		right right
 		did they use a lot of gas those vans
 	
 	
 		um
 		it did fairly well for me uh i got about fifteen sixteen
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		oh that is pretty good
 	
 	
 		in in the that's combination <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> and highway driving and then on the open road i can get about nineteen or <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh that
 		oh yeah that is nice i thought they used a lot more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> than that ah
 	
 	
 		hum-um yeah you would think it'd be a lot worse i know <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mini vans</ENAMEX> don't get much better than that they get about <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty one twenty two</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		no
 		right around there oh well that's interesting we are just in the opposite situation of you we're looking for something bigger  we have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> we just had
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		ah
 		ah
 	
 	
 		a new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> and so the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> that we have only has the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> seat belts and we need you know when we're all going in it we need <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">six</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so we're looking for something bigger and i
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i don't know we have a little <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Honda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> that my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> uses it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		to commute back and forth to work and it has been it almost has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two hundred thousand</NUMEX> miles
 	
 	
 		wow  you got your use out of that
 	
 	
 		right and it's been such a good car but i wish they made <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hondas</ENAMEX> with the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> seat belts i i don't i don't think they make them that big
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true
 		no i don't think so
 	
 	
 		and i i'm not sure that i'm ready for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">van</ENAMEX> yet
 	
 	
 		yeah i have looked at some of the uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toyota Toyota</ENAMEX> makes a real nice <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">van</ENAMEX> i i like theirs a lot
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		uh but if you really want size you know the prices are about the same depend you know you can spend as much on a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mini van</ENAMEX> as you do on a full size conversion van
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and the difference is the the conversion of course the mileage is a little bit worse
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but because you do have a bigger engine and bigger transmission you can pull stuff like <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trailers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> and stuff easier than you can with a you know the other <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mini van</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		right
 		uh-huh oh are there a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vans</ENAMEX> down there my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> lives in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Plano Texas</ENAMEX> and he said there's <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vans</ENAMEX> all over the place
 	
 	
 		oh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		oh yeah yeah just lots and lots of vans
 	
 	
 		
 
 		so that's i was kind of i my preference would to be just to go to a bigger car i think rather than rather than a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">van</ENAMEX> but you know even that is it's hard to find a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> that is big enough i guess
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 	
 	
 		the problem we have now is our <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> it doesn't have a bench seat up front so if we had the bench seat then we would be fine but when we bought it we
 	
 	
 		oh it doesn't yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		we didn't get the bench seat up front so
 	
 	
 		yeah well i don't know if you'd be how how old is your oldest
 	
 	
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> uh-huh
 	
 	
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> yeah see i i don't know how long you'd be happy like that
 		well i don't know how often all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all six</NUMEX> of you all will be in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> but i know that once you get one or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> seats in there
 	
 	
 		right
 		
 
 		that takes up  a lot of room
 	
 	
 		ah and then that yeah then you'd have your <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eight year old</TIMEX> you'd probably have your <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eight year old</TIMEX> up front on the bench seat
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but even even then after a while you'd feel cramped especially if it was ah you know a fairly long trip in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">more than about an hour</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that's true
 		that's true i haven't i haven't thought about that because is there a lot more <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> in the regular size <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vans</ENAMEX> than in a car
 	
 	
 		uh oh yes definitely you you know a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">station wagon</ENAMEX> the back end of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">station wagon</ENAMEX> probably can carry as much as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">van</ENAMEX> but as for passenger space
 		ah you can't beat a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">van</ENAMEX> because you can you can you can carry <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">van</ENAMEX> and that's a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mini van</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		on a large conversion van you can you know you can carry a lot you can carry <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about nine</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh so now why did you go with a large conversion van when you went
 	
 	
 		well because for what i wanted in a van the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mini vans</ENAMEX> were were about a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">thousand dollars</NUMEX> less
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and you get almost twice the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> in the conversion van than you do in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mini van</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		plus like i said all the extra pulling power and i didn't feel i was losing that much on gas mileage because they're not that far off
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh
 		right did you buy it new was it
 	
 	
 		yeah it was a new one uh-huh
 	
 	
 		oh and that's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only about a thousand</NUMEX> dollars difference
 	
 	
 		yeah i mean i was really surprised
 	
 	
 		yeah that surprises me too
 	
 	
 		because because when you you know you can like pick <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dodge</ENAMEX> for instance they got <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sizes of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mini vans</ENAMEX> one's the extra long and then the other the extra long option with all the power options you know windows locks and the nice stereo
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only about fifteen hundred</NUMEX> less than the comparable full size van
 	
 	
 		my word
 	
 	
 		and you know like i said uh the mileage on a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mini van</ENAMEX> is about oh <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty one twenty two</TIMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">highway</ENAMEX> and on the you know on the full size it was nineteen <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nineteen</ENAMEX> so that's still comparable
 	
 	
 		and that's nothing yeah so you know i i said you know given that i said
 	
 	
 		wow
