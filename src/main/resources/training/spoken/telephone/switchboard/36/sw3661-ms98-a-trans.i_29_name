 
     		
 	
 		he likes them
 	
 	
 		well uh the most i've done so far is like uh landscaping you know <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">bushes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">shrubs</ENAMEX> and stuff like that my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> likes to put out <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> and stuff in the flower beds  so i'm always having to uh turn the flower beds for her <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every year</TIMEX>
 		she puts the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> and i try to maintain the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">bushes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> and stuff
 	
 	
 		well i do vegetable gardening i rent a rotortiller once a year in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January</TIMEX> and
 		turn everything and then i start putting stuff in in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">third week</TIMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January</TIMEX> and there's stuff pretty much out there until the freeze hits whenever that is
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so i usually start off with onions and garlic and then i put in beets
 	
 	
 		hm
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and then uh put out
 	
 	
 		green beans
 	
 	
 		red red red beets but you can eat the tops too
 	
 	
 		oh i see
 	
 	
 		and then i usually put out um some kind of spinach or some type of green like that and then in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX> is when the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tomatoes</ENAMEX> and peppers and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lima beans</ENAMEX> and black eyed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peas</ENAMEX> and cucumbers and all that other good stuff goes out
 	
 	
 		hm
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</TIMEX> i try something i've never tried before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> i'm trying a product called well it's called spaghetti basically it's a squash like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">product</ENAMEX> when you cook it
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i've heard of that
 	
 	
 		when you yeah i've never tried that before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</TIMEX> i try something new and so this is the one i'm gonna try see if it works down here
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> has rose <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">bushes</ENAMEX> and she takes care of those
 	
 	
 		uh i see i'd like to do a vegetable garden but i don't have the yard size for it i'm in a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> lot line home but uh we're thinking of moving <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> the interest rates are getting so low we can't afford not to
 	
 	
 		well you know the vegetable gardens don't have to be very big this plot i have is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty two</TIMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> so that's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">seventy six square feet</NUMEX> which is not very big and
 		you know if you have <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crops</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early spring</TIMEX> and then <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crops</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crops</ENAMEX> in the fall on the same spot you can put a minimum of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crops</ENAMEX> like where i have um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um onions and garlic sometimes i'll put other things you know because the onions and garlics will mature in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		excuse me
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		so how do your <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tomatoes tomatoes</ENAMEX> do down here pretty good
 	
 	
 		oh they do real well i used the type called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Better Boy</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several years</TIMEX> which did well but it has not done well <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last couple years</TIMEX> so in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this past year</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i tried a new <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crop</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Celebrity</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Celebrity</ENAMEX> gave me pretty much continuous  <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tomatoes</ENAMEX> from the um <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">first week</TIMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June</TIMEX> until the freeze hit in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		course i think a lot of it was due to the mild weather and the rain but i had <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tomatoes</ENAMEX> on the table <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five months</TIMEX> which is
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		wow that's pretty good
 	
 	
 		in the in the past i usually got <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tomatoes</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three four weeks</TIMEX> and that would be it and then in the fall i'd you know get a couple <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more weeks</TIMEX> but this is a very unusual year
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh you try fruit like uh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">strawberries</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		well we did have <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">strawberries</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few years ago</TIMEX> but we don't do them anymore and we had a peach <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> and it was too much hassle you have to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spray</ENAMEX> it and uh
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		cover the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> and all these other things and it just proved to be more hassle than it was worth
 	
 	
 		um
 		yeah so <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetables</ENAMEX> are much easier then
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetables</ENAMEX> are pretty easy i think <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX> is has some difficulties of course any  some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetables</ENAMEX> are far more work than others the hard part is at the very beginning when you have to
 	
 	
 		hm
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		set up the garden and get everything but once the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> get going and then it's just a matter of keeping the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX> off
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah well that sounds neat you ever do anything like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">melons</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		no never done that
 	
 	
 		no i remember <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one year</TIMEX> at my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>' old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> we grew a um
 		i guess a pumpkin a squash plant you know turned out to be a pumpkin and uh it it bore pretty good size <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX> and then <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one year</TIMEX> we just let one of the squashes grow out it produced a really huge pumpkin
 		we're pretty surprised and they just got lucky because they didn't do anything to it no fertilizing or anything just kind of threw the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seeds</ENAMEX> out there
 		but uh looks pretty neat yeah this was down in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Antonio</ENAMEX> so i don't know
 	
 	
 		hm that's strange well you must've gotten lucky
 		well the climate's a little better for that down there for hot weather
 	
 	
 		i think so too i think so too i you know i noticed here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> well maybe it depends on where you live but it's like the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">shrubs</ENAMEX> don't do as well they don't grow as fast
 	
 	
 		well that's sometimes you have hot cold <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winters</TIMEX> but we haven't had anything so far this year
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i've got a tree that i planted that doesn't it's okay but it doesn't you know my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> planted a tree <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</TIMEX> after i planted <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mine</ENAMEX> and his is like <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times as big as mine
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		i don't know what it is i I think it is uh i have a feeling that the soil's not there's a lot of rocks in it
 	
 	
 		must be the soil
 	
 	
 		because all around me i can see where the erosion is from from the creek beds there's a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rock</ENAMEX> under me i have a feeling i'm i'm probably the roots are probably hitting rocks or something
 	
 	
 		um it's hard for them to go once they have no dirt there
 	
 	
 		yeah i try to keep it going but it's not getting very big i think in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five years</TIMEX> it grew like <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three or four</NUMEX> feet
 	
 	
 		maybe you need a
 	
 	
 		i know i
