 
     		
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerry</ENAMEX> tell me about what you think about the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Vietnam war</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		okay well i'm a <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Vietnam</ENAMEX> era <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">veteran</ENAMEX> and uh i was uh uh fortunate not to have to serve in the theater however uh my my support roll in the service was to support those in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">theater</ENAMEX> of operation
 		uh i'm of the old school that believes that um
 		the uh uh contracts that we made back <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX> uh needed to be honored
 		however uh i think we could've executed the war and gotten it over a whole lot quicker
 		oh but those are my personal thoughts and i think that if we'd let the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generals</ENAMEX> run the war like we let the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generals</ENAMEX> run <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War</ENAMEX> Two we'd have got it over a whole lot quicker and lost a lot fewer people
 		but as it was the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> ran the the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Korean</ENAMEX> conflict and ultimately the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vietnam</ENAMEX> thing and we managed to come out uh losers all way around
 		and so this is what triggered ultimately triggered the us uh uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>  per se being uh deciding to get out of the role of world <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">policeman</ENAMEX> your views
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh</ENAMEX> as i understand it and i uh don't don't a lot about it uh we got in there because of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">France</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">uh France</ENAMEX> was there first they had
 	
 	
 		well we got into it because of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEATO</ENAMEX> agreement back just right after <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War</ENAMEX> Two
 		that uh we pledged a mutual um uh defense of of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">South Vietnamese</ENAMEX>
 		and as it turned out they were in a civil war one with another and really we i i question us you know now of course uh hindsight is all too clear um
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		so  we're we we have to have to deal with with the uh situation as as we played it but
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerry</ENAMEX> what did you think of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> like uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jane Fonda</ENAMEX> another war anti antiwar activist
 	
 	
 		i  don't get me started on those people
 		you know before she before <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jane Fonda</ENAMEX> did did what she did i thought she was a wonderful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> but after uh uh well
 		i i just don't have anything want anything to do with her anymore because you support uh you support your government
 	
 	
 		right or wrong
 	
 	
 		uh okay right or wrong i don't think is is we can determine whether we were right or wrong
 		because  you're you're having to deal with again again uh i think we could've made a different agreement back in forties the forties the late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">forties era</TIMEX> that would've kept out of there
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		uh you know i i didn't realize that we'd signed some type of deal like that i thought we came in as as <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisors</ENAMEX> to the the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> and then they decided to pull out and
 	
 	
 		so
 		can you hold just <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Terry</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one moment</TIMEX> please
 	
 	
 		sure sure
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		wonder what happens to this little beastie on call waiting or something
 		huh that's neat
 		well that's not that's okay
 	
 	
 		sorry for the delay
 		uh yeah this is the uh the the uh the mutual defense thing
 		was  we we
 		yeah it was complicated and i don't think everybody knows the whole situation i don't
 		but from what i can gather is we went and said yeah we will help the uh <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">South Vietnamese</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> should they ask well the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> went in and tried their old style warfare and uh
 		got soundly thrashed
 		and we didn't do a whole lot better
 	
 	
 		um no i had thought that they had uh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> there or something
 	
 	
 		well yeah that was the old <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX> but see the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> were our uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">allies</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX> and they're also our <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">allies</ENAMEX> in SEATO
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		which was the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South East Asia</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treaty Organization</ENAMEX> which has since been abandoned disbanded as far as i know
 		you know <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX> is is on the way of being disbanded uh
 		but uh
 		the
 		yeah the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> yeah we went in as an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ally</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> and says yeah we'll we'll help you out if you get in a bind well they got in a bind and says we don't wanna you know play anymore
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so uh we we kind of we kind of got started got the ball rolling ourselves
 		versus a bunch of top secret silly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> uh um
 	
 	
 		i see
 	
 	
 		oh operations operations and then a full scale you know full scale <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">troops et cetera et cetera et</ENAMEX> cetera
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty two</TIMEX> so uh i barely well i missed it seventy <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> is when we quit sending <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> over
 	
 	
 		
 
 		ah yeah roughly
 	
 	
 		yeah i i was just probably <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three three or four years old</TIMEX>
