 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		okay  i'm sorry speaking of air pollution i'm  coughing like a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> now um
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		i'm not sure what contributes to air pollution exactly
 		i find it hard to believe that a lot of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hair sprays</ENAMEX> and things that we use
 		cause the air pollution and it just doesn't seem like
 	
 	
 		yeah it it
 	
 	
 		but i guess when you think of it everybody has some sort of aerosol in their home you know and it it's kind of dangerous
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah that's true uh i don't know we live um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		well i'm close to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Salt Lake</ENAMEX> and there's mountains um you know all around but sometimes i i think tend to hold a little bit of it in you know really it's it's fairly clean
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		um i think it's a fairly clean <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> compared to some but you have quite as
 	
 	
 		but you think the mountains and the are kind of a barrier hum that's a
 	
 	
 		yeah i think sometimes it seems to be but
 	
 	
 		that's an interesting thought
 	
 	
 		but uh anyway i don't know i know there's a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> here when i drive down you know along the just along the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">freeway</ENAMEX> there's a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> that they're burning things and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		um
 		here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> i know a lot of the
 		pretty much every <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">place</ENAMEX> here is is relatively flat and so i would think that that would probably contribute to us not having that big of a like a smog problem or something like that i'm not sure
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 		yeah we we have a real fog problem um <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last few years</TIMEX> just in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">through December</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January</TIMEX> it it really it is foggy and seems to just um
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		it's kind of like it it just stays for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a month</TIMEX>  it's quite foggy but uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		jeez i don't i don't know what else i know cars
 	
 	
 		i i guess yeah i guess i've never really uh thought about the fact that like in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> they they have a lot of smog problems
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and it's real hilly there so that is probably something that plays a big factor  i think probably just uh a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factories</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		um you know they have the smoke stacks i guess you call them i don't know what you call them and different things like that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah that's that's what i see burning a lot and i'm not exactly sure what they're burning i know uh-huh there's some oil <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> and and i'm sure that that contributes a lot just the burning of the chemicals
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		aren't they supposed to be coming out with some sort of uh special gas or something that doesn't emit certain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemicals</ENAMEX> or something
 	
 	
 		oh i don't know i haven't i haven't heard that i know uh i don't know how your emissions test is on your <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> or anything but i know i think they they differ from state to state
 	
 	
 		hum
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		but um you know that's been a new thing in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last few years</TIMEX> and i guess some <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> are a lot worse than others i think those uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		what are they the i know a a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rabbit</ENAMEX>'s one diesel the diesel <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> yeah they they seem to put out quite a bit
 	
 	
 		uh-huh the diesel oh yeah
 		
 
 		i don't know a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with diesels  unless it's a truck you know
 	
 	
 		huh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		but uh
 	
 	
 		oh well do you um are you working for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T I</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		no i don't i work i work in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Waco</ENAMEX> at a TV station so my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> works at <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> so that's how i
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh
 		oh uh-huh and that's how you got involved yeah no we we have um uh my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>'s sister lives in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> actually and they kind of got it us involved that way
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah do you work at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> I oh okay
 		okay
 		oh okay that's interesting
 	
 	
 		yeah but well i don't i don't know much
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		what else causes air pollution um noise
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah noise
 	
 	
 		noise causes air pollution and noise pollution
 	
 	
 		yeah i've got speaking of noise you can probably hear my little
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah  that's why i thought of it i thought
 	
 	
 		yes he's he is quite noisy yes jeez i don't know i know that um
 	
 	
 		hum how funny
 	
 	
 		don't dumps  you know where you dump all your trash in the they uh yeah and i'm sure that does i know they're always churning that up and i i think they burn a lot there too i
 	
 	
 		oh yeah landfills yeah
 		we just
 		yeah we just had a big uh thing here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Waco</ENAMEX> they're needing to open a new landfill or to expand onto the old landfill
 		and uh it it's really been a big fight because a lot of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that live by the landfill don't want it expanded because they're thinking that their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> is going to be contaminated somehow and so they
 	
 	
 		oh well  yeah i don't think i'd i'd like that you know we um when we've taken things to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dump</ENAMEX> just
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dump</ENAMEX> that is uh you know closest to us there's some <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> around there and i know that on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">windy days</TIMEX> you know they're always moving the the trash over to different spots and they've got those big <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bulldozers</ENAMEX> and you can see the dust
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		oh yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">flying</ENAMEX> and and i'm sure that their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> are really quite dusty and
 	
 	
 		and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one one</NUMEX> of the big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concerns</ENAMEX> is they have a there's a school right across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">highway</ENAMEX> from the landfill yeah so the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> were really really upset
 	
 	
 		oh is there
 		worried about the their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> getting huh
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah and they've they've been fighting over it for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last year</TIMEX> and they just now approved it so they were gonna try an appeal or something
