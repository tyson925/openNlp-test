 
     		
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wendy</ENAMEX> how'd you like to start off and
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well um they said talk about um gee oh heavens
 	
 	
 		everyday occurrences that
 	
 	
 		that annoy you okay i don't mind these phone calls but i hate the uh sales calls
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but and what about you
 	
 	
 		um  for an invasion of privacy i feel like uh  when i use write a check then they want my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">driver</ENAMEX>'s license and they write down my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">number</ENAMEX> or or when i
 		use my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Visa</ENAMEX> card they want my phone number and they put that into their computer then they can look up yeah and they look up where i live and uh then they mail me stuff and
 	
 	
 		they can sell it sure
 		get all sides
 		yep all kinds of demographics just from that info and anymore you know uh you don't have to give out your  well you know how they used to ask for if you wrote a check they would ask for your credit card number
 		but they can't do that anymore or at least you're not legally  um  you know have to give it to them
 	
 	
 		you know what uh we have is we've got our credit card number on our
 		uh guarantee card so they have to write down
 	
 	
 		what's a guarantee card
 	
 	
 		it's a card
 		that says this check is good for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to a hundred</NUMEX> bucks to the merchant
 	
 	
 		oh i don't i i we don't use that that i know of here
 	
 	
 		on ours it's just on the back of our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Visa</ENAMEX> and it says guarantee
 	
 	
 		oh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and you might wanna check out your <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Visa</ENAMEX> it might have one that on there already
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		uh
 		so do you
 	
 	
 		but particularly what i was speaking of are the telemarketing phone calls you know at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">odd hours</TIMEX> that i get yeah
 	
 	
 		buy computers
 	
 	
 		well and not necessarily computers you know it can be the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> sometimes the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are worse than the computers because you can just hang up on the computer but the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> you know will do anything to keep you on the line
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		and um you know i i i don't like to be rude to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> but i find myself becoming more and more um  abrasive because i just don't you know feel like they should be calling me on my own personal private time
 	
 	
 		what do you think about that
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh caller ID</ENAMEX> when you call in like on an <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight hundred</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">number</ENAMEX> or something
 		or uh to buy something and then they know who you are and uh where you're calling from and your address and all that and
 	
 	
 		well i have to say that you know if you're going to do it then you have to realize the consequences
 	
 	
 		but see most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> don't know that that information's recorded
 	
 	
 		yeah well i i i i suppose that's true but i know that you know whenever you're giving that kind of information out particularly when you're buying something you know your name automatically goes on a list which is sold sold to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred</NUMEX> other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">companies</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yep you seem well informed
 	
 	
 		well i've i i've studied advertising in college and that um you know that's one of the areas i suppose that we covered
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but i i i would never do telemarketing as a job i can't stand rejection
 	
 	
 		no that's kind of a a bummer i'm looking forward to the time when uh my phone at home can tell me who's calling
 	
 	
 		yeah that would be nice
 	
 	
 		and then i don't answer it if i don't wanna talk to you
 	
 	
 		i suppose <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> will come i
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		well  any others that you can think of
 	
 	
 		we'll see
 		another invasion of privacy uh everyday occurrence
 		i can't
 	
 	
 		well i mean unless you go to the extremes like uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> coming up to you i had this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX> come to me in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mall</ENAMEX> and said jeez you look just lovely i just wanted to tell you that by the way i'm a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Kay</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> and here's my business card can i set you up for a facial
 		and i mean i was shopping for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> presents in the mall
 		and i found i found her tactics extremely rude because she was preying on my uh you know uh everybody's self esteem you know gee somebody thinks i'm pretty you know
 	
 	
 		sure
 		and gosh they wanna tell me i look great
 	
 	
 		that's right by the way here's my business card let me set you up for a facial and get you to spend fifty bucks
 	
 	
 		
 
 		you know as a consumer we have to be wary of all that type of propaganda
 	
 	
 		exactly and i was very flattered until she told me she the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> she was with
 	
 	
 		oh what a bummer that would be a kind of a deflator
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		she goes to everybody in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mall</ENAMEX> and says the same thing so i wasn't too flattered
 	
 	
 		let's see i took something back to  one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> today a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> gift and uh
 		i had to show my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ID</ENAMEX> and uh blood type and because i didn't have a sales slip and it was interesting
 	
 	
 		oh what a bummer did you even have the tag on the item
 	
 	
 		yeah uh
 		uh no
 	
 	
 		so they were particularly uh well uncooperative
 	
 	
 		they were and uh i guess the time to do it i talked to the with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> at work is right after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> because they're too busy to give you a rush  yeah
 	
 	
 		they're so swamped they let you get by yeah
 	
 	
 		well i don't have anything else to say
 	
 	
 		i think we've covered it
 	
 	
 		well it's been a pleasure <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wendy</ENAMEX> bye
 	
 	
 		and you too bye-bye
