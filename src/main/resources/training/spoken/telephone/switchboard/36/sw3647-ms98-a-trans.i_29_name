 		oh that was good <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Utah</ENAMEX> i've had a couple of but that was it
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		all right well good to hear good to hear
 	
 	
 		
 
 		learned about their basketball team
 	
 	
 		
 
 		which one
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">uh Jazz</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh yeah the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Utah Jazz</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah they're they're pretty good they got some
 	
 	
 		that's what i heard yeah
 	
 	
 		good  good some good uh good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX> out there
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		well you ready for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">New Year</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eve</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i am
 	
 	
 		good should we uh start this so we can what was your name again <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nancy</ENAMEX> that's right and i'm <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brian</ENAMEX> just a moment
 	
 	
 		okay
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nancy</ENAMEX>
 		right right
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">okay Nancy</ENAMEX> the i guess the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s subject is benefits in a job other than salary what uh what do you feel are important to you or other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> as as crucial benefits
 	
 	
 		right
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		well i'm a little different than other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> because i don't have benefits with my job
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i'm a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurse</ENAMEX> and i work i float
 	
 	
 		oh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so that i have no benefits except higher pay for doing that
 	
 	
 		right uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so i find that it makes up for what i pay for insurance and i i make enough money by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the hour</TIMEX> to make up for that
 	
 	
 		to to compensate for some of the benefits oh
 	
 	
 		right uh-huh yeah it's cheaper for me to buy insurance by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the month</TIMEX> than to work <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> someplace
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		and then i have my freedom i can work <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven days in a row</TIMEX> and take a week off or whatever i want to do
 	
 	
 		well that's that's an excellent so actually that is a benefit uh
 	
 	
 		well it is to me most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> prefer the security of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekends</TIMEX> off and
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		knowing that their insurance is paid and their retirement and i'm just
 		really not interested in all that
 	
 	
 		right right
 		well i guess that's a good point uh i do belong to a a large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporation</ENAMEX> or my that where i'm currently employed
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and there's uh there's some different things uh one that you've already mentioned is is health insurance i think through our health insurance that i can get better rates as a through a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> plan
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		as opposed to going out and getting health insurance on an individual basis because i had to do that at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time when i wasn't employed with a large corporation
 		and that got to be somewhat expensive and so i i think one of the benefits i i see is the uh is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> discount
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right and especially if you have a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> then i think it makes a big difference
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and yes and that's that's one thing i do have
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		if i didn't have a family i don't think i would have as as a male or as a as an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> of in this stage of my life i don't think i would have insurance uh other
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i don't think i would go through that expense <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> other benefit that you mentioned is the flexible work <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> and in my previous job i really enjoyed because they had what was called a flex schedule
 		where i could go and i could work uh <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">nine hour</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> and have like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">only work four hours</TIMEX> or i could do uh work <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four days a week</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">ten hours a day</TIMEX> and have a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> you know <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three week day</TIMEX> weekend
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		right
 	
 	
 		and make uh make my job flexible in that case
 	
 	
 		could you change that as you felt like it or did you have to do it <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the same every week</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		well basically yeah i had to do that uh the same uh for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about every quarter of the year</TIMEX> i mean
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> because i was in a in a position of management i had responsibilities over <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that uh i needed to make my schedule uh
 		so that if i was not there i would have coverage by some other management <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> so
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so i i think that uh that was a that was an excellent benefit that i really enjoyed and i don't currently have that in my current <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX> but uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you mentioned uh flexible work schedule and that's that's good
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh what other benefits do you think are important
 	
 	
 		oh well i guess retirement that kind of thing which i don't worry much about so
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah yeah that's true
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i just prefer to worry about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> and probably not a practical attitude but that's who i am so
 	
 	
 		well and that's an individual thing
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah with uh with our current uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> we do have a nice retirement package and also a a nice thing that that we have in our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporation</ENAMEX> is a uh is a profit sharing plan
 		where we can uh participate in the the profits of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> if we're you know if we've been there a while and we're vested uh which means that you know we have a an interest uh in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> that we can
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh get some of the benefits of the either the profit high times or or in a sense suffer during the low times
 		and uh also uh in one of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>'s uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> where she worked they'd had a real nice profit sharing plan that that effectively they made a certain
