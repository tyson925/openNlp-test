 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		okay what kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> would you have
 	
 	
 		okay
 		um well i like to cook um but i don't like getting too awfully fancy about it just because um
 	
 	
 		oh i do too
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">hum-um</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh it's too much pressure  you know if i have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> over for dinner i like it to be nice but relaxed yeah
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		well yeah you can't enjoy it right
 	
 	
 		and so i don't like to arrive or or when they arrive for me to be completely worn out so
 	
 	
 		that's that's what i like doing things like making lasagna just because i can have it ready and baking in the oven it's  everybody just
 	
 	
 		yeah exactly
 	
 	
 		says how wonderful it is and it's it's like uh yes uh i that's one of those things that i got famous for in college <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> would come and say could you would you come over and make lasagna for me  it's like well i can't really give you a recipe um  i can
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh yeah</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		uh-huh you just do it
 	
 	
 		i can just do it  so it's i like doing that kind of stuff and it's it's fun because in fact that's what we had for a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> party last week
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		we just had a bunch of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> over and we had we did lasagna and garlic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bread</ENAMEX> and ah yummy
 	
 	
 		um boy i like that
 	
 	
 		uh i do too in fact
 	
 	
 		yeah well i'm planning a and naturally this is appropriate because i'm planning dinner for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">um people</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> and the next night hm on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> there'll be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> here altogether so
 	
 	
 		oh oh good
 		uh i'd say one thing we've done have done quite a bit through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the holidays</TIMEX> just because it's a real easy is just baked <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">potato</ENAMEX> dinners
 	
 	
 		oh yeah uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and have you like <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three or four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couples</ENAMEX> come over and i'll do the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">potatoes</ENAMEX> and you know like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">butter</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cheese</ENAMEX> and stuff and have everybody else just bring a couple of toppings whatever they like
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and it turns out great because i mean you've got like hot <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sauce</ENAMEX> and taco <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meat</ENAMEX> and barbecue and you know <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacon</ENAMEX> and all that good stuff
 	
 	
 		yeah that's fun
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but it's it's inexpensive plus it's real easy on the hostess because you can just have the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">potatoes</ENAMEX> ready and just have a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salad</ENAMEX> with it and you got a great dinner
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah that's a good idea
 	
 	
 		it's it's real easy i like doing that part ah i'm in favor of very little clean up um very little planning  because we've got <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three or four</NUMEX>  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couples</ENAMEX> that we get together with to play games and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh yeah</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it's we invariably end up at my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> since i've got <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> and that it's it's fine because then i can just say okay fine you bring this you bring this you bring this we're done oh it's pretty cool
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah yeah that's good well one of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">favorites</ENAMEX> if i don't wanna have other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> bring stuff i just wanna treat them is to make <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chicken</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX> it's it's very easy to
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		you don't like it oh you do okay yeah i have a really easy recipe for that where you just brown the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chicken</ENAMEX> and then you
 	
 	
 		oh i love it
 		hm
 	
 	
 		put <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX> in the bottom of the pan you pour bouillon or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chicken broth</ENAMEX> over it and or you put the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chicken</ENAMEX> in then pour the uh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">broth</ENAMEX> over and you can put <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mushrooms</ENAMEX> in if you want and then just
 	
 	
 		oh
 		over the uncooked <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah over <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">uncooked rice</ENAMEX> and you can either microwave it or do it in the oven and it just it fluffs up and it's really moist and
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh how neat
 		huh now i've done it with where you put you cook the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX> well i guess you probably could do it some way but cook the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX> and then take a can of like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cream</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mushroom soup</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cream</ENAMEX> of chicken <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">soup</ENAMEX> and put a bit of white <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> in it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh</ENAMEX> ooh yeah
 	
 	
 		and every once in a while i'll put in white i'll slice white <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grapes</ENAMEX> and i'll put it in there and
 		that's because i'm not a real big wine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> but i like it it it adds something to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chicken</ENAMEX> and then just bake it and it makes a wonderful <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sauce</ENAMEX> over the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh yeah</ENAMEX>
 		hm well i'll keep that one in mind too yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah  it's it that was one of the first things i made for my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> because it's like hm yeah i could actually find something i could cook real easy that would be kind of sort of elegant kind of
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah you can get away with it and you know in having a semi nice dinner or you know semi formal but
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		but then i didn't i hadn't thought about doing it with uncooked <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX> so just like in a thirteen by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> pan
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah you put in um let's see what was it <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three quarters</TIMEX> of cup of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX> or
 	
 	
 		hm
 		hm
 	
 	
 		it depends on you can really vary it but you have to put the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> in proportionally i can't remember i think it was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three quarters</TIMEX> cup <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> cups water <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> cups um broth
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		huh
 		yeah yeah it's i i use that for breakfast for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX> and for when i cook <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pasta</ENAMEX> or something i'll i'll put a little bit of bouillon in there just to give it a little extra flavor
 	
 	
 		and
 		yeah that's flavor um-hum
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hm</ENAMEX> now that would be good how long do you have to bake it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh um let's see i think it was an hour i've done it in the microwave so often lately because it's it's really easy  yeah
 	
 	
 		i do i do microwave too a lot  it's
 	
 	
 		but i think it's <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about an hour</TIMEX> or maybe it's <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">only half hour</TIMEX> hm um
 	
 	
 		how long would it be in the microwave how long would it be in the microwave
 	
 	
 		you just until the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX> looks fluffy and and not overdone you know before it gets overdone
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 		okay  do you just brown the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chicken</ENAMEX> to get it colored or do you go ahead and let it cook through
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah um i'd let it cook just a little bit just so that the cooking goes a little faster but
 	
 	
 		okay hm
 		oh this is a beneficial call i like this  yeah but that one's an easy one it's like just put in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> of mine makes it where she goes ahead and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seasons</TIMEX> up the with the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">soup</ENAMEX> and the wine put in garlic and onion powder
 	
 	
 		yeah well i liked it your idea too there
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		or chopped onions if you wanna do that you know whatever whatever you however much effort you feel like putting into it but it it makes a great i mean my i've got a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two year old</TIMEX> and a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four year old</TIMEX> and they love it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and because because my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> calls it her gravy and i mean she thinks it's wonderful i'm like good you're a picky eater if i can get you to eat
