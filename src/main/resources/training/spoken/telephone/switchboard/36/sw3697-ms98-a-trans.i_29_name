 
     		
 	
 		okay now then you heard the question what what do you like to do for yourself in car automobile repairs
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 		well i'll tell you i used to do a lot more repairs when <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> were easy to work on than i do now
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		i do uh i do the easy stuff now i i change oil
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> and then what some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> would consider a little more difficult i i'll change spark plugs and
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		i'll change you know points and you you know the air filters that kind of stuff
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		but uh i can't do as much as i used to um i used to do a whole lot more but not anymore they're just too weird to work on now
 	
 	
 		is that the reason you're not doing it or are you so busy you don't have time to do it
 	
 	
 		well that's part of it yeah part of it is like you said i don't have time
 	
 	
 		hm well
 		okay well being a female and being alone you
 		i don't do anything but put <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gasoline</ENAMEX> in my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> and let someone else check the oil even but um have you had any major repairs recently
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		well um on this car i've got now no but i had a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">van</ENAMEX> before and it was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">only two years old</TIMEX> and it had transmission go out on it
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		but fortunately that was covered under the warranty
 	
 	
 		okay
 		well you should be very feel very fortunate i had um
 		have a transmission replaced in an <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eighty six</NUMEX> automobile and i'll declare that's an expensive
 	
 	
 		hm
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		yes um-hum  maybe i should have just traded the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> in
 	
 	
 		yeah sometimes it makes me wonder
 	
 	
 		oh it just well i have a very comfortable <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> and i
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		have a health problem that i need
 		a large comfortable <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> so um  anyway i have a new transmission and i'm sure that any of them would have
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 	
 	
 		cost almost or charged me almost the same amount but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it hurts it hurts real bad
 	
 	
 		
  
 		did you take it to a dealership
 	
 	
 		no i took it to an independent out in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Garland</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um-hum  oh i see
 	
 	
 		i had um these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> were recommended by a neighbor
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and you know that's the only thing i am not a native of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh i see
 	
 	
 		so that means i have to depend on
 		on trustworthy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and that's anyway it's fixed it's running and i pray that i get my thirteen <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">hundred dollars</NUMEX> out of it um um-hum
 	
 	
 		oh gosh it's gonna have to run for a little for a while yet
 	
 	
 		oh i know it uh-huh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it certainly is frightening what work are you in
 	
 	
 		uh i i work for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> i i work in the networking area
 	
 	
 		oh
 		okay okay

 		yeah where there are a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> down there that could help me with my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> but they're all too busy so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i have to  do it the other way and that's find someone and pay them to do it
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		so i certainly hope you have a nice <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">New Year</TIMEX>
