 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		do any woodworking at all
 	
 	
 		yes as a matter of fact i do i uh i i took a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX> classes when i was in junior high and high school
 	
 	
 		oh great
 	
 	
 		and uh had a had a lot of fun in it i i made uh
 		a table with a shelf underneath that goes that's for my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> and uh
 	
 	
 		oh how nice
 	
 	
 		stereo cabinets and all kinds of stuff
 	
 	
 		oh
 		wow you do do a lot do you have your own tools or do you have some
 	
 	
 		yeah my my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> has uh let's see a
 		a radial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> saw and all that kind of stuff out in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garage</ENAMEX> that that i use once in a while now i don't have a lot of time for that kind of thing any more but
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		whenever he needs a help hand doing something that he's making then i go out there and help him
 	
 	
 		oh that's nice so do you um what kind of wood do you use usually the pine or
 	
 	
 		uh it depends on the project really uh
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		i think i made my stereo <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cabinet</ENAMEX> out of pine
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um something my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX>'s been he made my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandmother</ENAMEX> a jewelry box and he made that out of poplar
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh how neat
 	
 	
 		yeah uh
 	
 	
 		so he's done he's done wood projects too
 	
 	
 		yeah i i i think
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		my my involvement in in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> got him in that
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		hold on for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">just one second</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		okay
 	
 	
 		oh well that's that's good So do you stain them and all that yourself when you're finished with them
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah there's
 		just about everything i make is either it's either stained or
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that definitely is a real if you like the color of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wood</ENAMEX> it's real nice to just put on that clear finish coat that keeps it sealed up and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh
 	
 	
 		looks nice
 	
 	
 		oh well that's interesting i i've always been interested in woodworking i
 		the type i do is a little bit different but i after the projects are done i like to paint them and um you know make different types of
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		oh i just finished <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">some Christmas</TIMEX> decorations a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> cut cut them out for us and then we you know got together and painted them
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and um he does you know he makes the shelves to hang on your <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wall</ENAMEX> or he makes bookshelves or corner cupboards and i think it's fascinating i i really think it's
 		if you have the tools yeah i think you'd have to have the tools to make it
 	
 	
 		yeah it's
 		it's a lot of fun as long you
 		you got the right tools and everything
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		oh do you so you don't have much time for it though even though you
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you have access to the tools now
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah right i haven't done anything on my own for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about six years</TIMEX> now
 	
 	
 		uh
 		well now do you follow a pattern or do you just kind of
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		start measuring and cutting or
 	
 	
 		if if you're if if you start to make something you have to like basically draw draw the design of whatever it is you want
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and and determine the the measurements uh of everything
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and then
 		make sure that that make sure that that what you put on paper will work and then put it to wood
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh do you save a lot of money rather than buying the finished project
 	
 	
 		yeah you you really you can save a whole a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a</NUMEX> a lot of money
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		you can go to a like a a furniture <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX> and a stereo <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cabinet</ENAMEX> like i built only a lot smaller would cost you probably in the neighborhood of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">forty</NUMEX> to fifty dollars
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh
 	
 	
 		i think i spent
 		a total of maybe fifteen to <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh wow that is a big difference
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and and had wood left over and you know to use for other other things
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 		oh that is a
 	
 	
 		and it and it and i and i got my when i made it it's made to the specifications that i wanted because i have an oversize stereo
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		that wouldn't fit in most newer stereo cabinets because they make all those
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh</ENAMEX> so you got what you want besides getting it for a better price and
 	
 	
 		yeah they make all those smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">components</ENAMEX> and this is a stereo that i've had since
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i think about nineteen eighty
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		oh well that's great how do
 	
 	
 		that that kind of thing works out to your advantage as well you can make it to to fit your design instead of whatever they give you
 	
 	
 		right huh so you've made the a stereo <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cabinet</ENAMEX> and what else did you say
 	
 	
 		uh i've made a it's a it's a table that has a shelf underneath
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh
 	
 	
 		uh i've made a it it's supposed to be a
 		uh old style lamp <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">holder</ENAMEX> you know like oil lamp holder
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh oh how neat
 	
 	
 		with a with a mirror in the back of it but i don't have a lamp to put in it
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so i just use it as a mirror in my room
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh
 		huh well that's interesting i i like a lot of the old-fashioned type furniture the washbasin type things and i guess you could make that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		now where you don't find those in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> to buy very often you can make the kind of
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		things that you want have you ever made any type of chair
 	
 	
 		no i i never dove into the chairs it
 	
 	
 		i wonder if they would be a harder type project would it
 	
 	
 		um it depends on how intricate the the the design is and whether or not you're going to
 		uh
