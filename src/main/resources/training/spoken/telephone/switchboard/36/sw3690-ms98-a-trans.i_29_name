 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		all right
 	
 	
 		what what uh what are some of your favorite places to uh eat at
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">uh Royal Tokyo</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Tokyo</ENAMEX> uh-huh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh um Benihana</ENAMEX>'s
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		enchiladas
 	
 	
 		oh all right
 	
 	
 		um
 		and actually <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Red Lobster</ENAMEX>  so what about you
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		well i'm a vegetarian so uh my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">places</ENAMEX> are somewhat my my my choices are somewhat limited uh but my very favorite is the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Olive Garden</ENAMEX> i think uh
 		if or or else uh uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">El Chico</ENAMEX>'s if i have if i had my choice that's where i like to go
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yeah i haven't been in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> for very long and so i don't know you know too many places to eat
 	
 	
 		yeah uh i guess that would be really hard being vegetarian less
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		it it it is a little bit uh you know there are at almost every <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX> there are uh things to eat it's just depends on you know whether whether what you really want to eat is there
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i could appreciate that
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah are are you a vegetarian also or
 	
 	
 		uh no no i'm i do eat meat um-hum
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh yeah
 		oh
 	
 	
 		i guess being brought up that way i do have a tendency though toward <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chicken</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> seafood
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so
 		um what made you choose to be a vegetarian
 	
 	
 		well uh several reasons um um most most importantly i have a uh uh disease in in both of uh in in all of my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">joints</ENAMEX> that uh  in in which <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX> is a big factor
 	
 	
 		ah
 	
 	
 		and uh  several reports uh in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last five years</TIMEX> have given validity to the uh to the to the theory that that uh vegetarian diet diet greatly reduces the pain involved with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">uh arthritis</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh have you found that to be true
 	
 	
 		yeah it really it really does work um  even to the point now where uh i'm able to run you know to go out running or jogging
 		on a a periodic basis which  which was impossible before yeah uh yeah it it it really has helped uh unfortunately um
 	
 	
 		oh well that's great
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i still i i can't give up uh milk
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so so i drink uh i <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drink skim milk</ENAMEX> but  if i had my way i'd drink a gallon gallon a day  so but but my my restaurant choices then uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh
 	
 	
 		i guess  since i've uh been a vegetarian i've loved fettucini alfredo  and so and so ah but any place i go that has that that's what that's what i eat it doesn't doesn't matter
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 		oh well then there's a real good restaurant you should try it's called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rocco</ENAMEX>'s
