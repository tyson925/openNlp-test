 		we've got <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		meow <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">meow cats</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		meow <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">meow cats</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		that's that's exactly what they do we got we've got um one that's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about three and a half</NUMEX> and he's black and white
 		and one that's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> and she's all white although she's a little dirty now and then we got <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> that's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year old</TIMEX> and is what they call tortoise tortoise hair which is kind of multi
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">multicolored</ENAMEX> and um
 		she's the one that's most vocal i think
 	
 	
 		my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> and her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> had <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> and it was kind of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">alley cat</ENAMEX> and it kept going out in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">alley</ENAMEX> and getting pregnant
 		and it looked kind of like a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Persian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> but anyway went and got pregnant the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time they advertised in the newspaper free kittens and and nobody would come over and do anything
 		and then they changed to ad to read <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Persian</ENAMEX> like kittens <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty five</TIMEX> dollars and they were gone in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX>
 		
 
 	
 	
 		free market it worked well all all our <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> have been uh have been neutered or spayed or what have you our white <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> has
 		got some <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Persian</ENAMEX> like qualities and big and it's and it's very long haired
 		which makes it look even bigger the other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> are short haired <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		we let our female uh get pregnant as a matter of fact it's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AKC</ENAMEX> so we reached out for a stud
 		and when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">the uh puppies</ENAMEX> arrived we made sure the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> were there to see it uh we thought it was a
 		very simple uh
 		course in birth
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bees</ENAMEX> and uh
 		the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> has had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> litters and i'm glad the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> experienced the process uh
 		i didn't see anything wrong with it
 	
 	
 		as i said we're we're not going to end up with any kittens we figured we had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> before these both of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of which died from old age
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it was <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about um</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fourteen</TIMEX> and a half
 		and then <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> died very young from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">feline leukemia</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX> when they didn't you know now they've got shots for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">feline leukemia</ENAMEX> but back when this <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> died
 		which was oh some <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten years ago</TIMEX> they didn't have feline <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">leukemia</ENAMEX> shots so
 		so it got ill then it got better and then it got ill and died immediately so
 	
 	
 		huh
 		well we nearly lost a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> time she had a litter we didn't get her on vitamins soon enough
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		some distressed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> was just the hindquarters wouldn't work so we ran to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vet</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one Sunday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> believe it or not they've got <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty four hour</TIMEX> vets in emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinics</ENAMEX> and they they charge
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		they charge like that too
 		and uh he said well there's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> things and he said well that's not it the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> one that's not by the time he got to <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> that's not the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX>'s were in the lobby just crying their heads off
 		and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> one got corrected the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> and we saved the dog thank goodness it just it didn't have the right vitamins to keep it going with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">the puppies</ENAMEX> draining her milk
 	
 	
 		oh my
 	
 	
 		so we enjoy <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> because uh they kind of bark when someone shouldn't be around the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> we do not let them in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> at all but they're outside <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> and uh
 		what are your <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> do they uh meow at all if some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stranger</ENAMEX> comes
 	
 	
 		well i don't think so but they're inside
 		um part of the time outside part of the time and um
 		oh i don't know they uh
 		well they're not watch <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> or anything but i tell you what we don't have any <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> or or any <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">uh rodents</ENAMEX> or anything like that they
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		they certainly keep things uh neat and clean things stay away
 	
 	
 		do do do they actually kill <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh well at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time we know we've had <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> that have killed <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> and most of time unfortunately they end up killing birds
 	
 	
 		ooh
 	
 	
 		and they'll leave us a present on the back or front step and there'll be a  bird
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		missing a head or you know whatever but uh we got in at least once i saw cat one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> not this <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> but one of them that's now died that that had a had a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> got a a rabbit that was in the backyard
 	
 	
 		killed it
 	
 	
 		no uh we got it to let go the rabbit we heard this horrible shrill noise and didn't know what it was and it was a rabbit screaming for it life so we went out there and convinced the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> to let go of the rabbit
 	
 	
 		well we've got a pet rabbit in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> i forgot to mention that and uh
 		when we've been having a fence put in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> got to the rabbit and it was no longer a live rabbit
 	
 	
 		oh my well i we where over to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> they had a pet rabbit and this pet rabbit looks just like our white <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> we always called the white <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> a big rabbit and the fact of it the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> and the rabbit looked pretty similar
 	
 	
 		have you heard about <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> train their rabbits
 	
 	
 		these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> had their rabbits outside
