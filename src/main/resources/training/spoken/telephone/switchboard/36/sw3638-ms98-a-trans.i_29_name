 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh well uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cowboys</ENAMEX> are my favorite <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> that's pretty easy to say nowadays lot easier than it was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple years ago</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but they had a big win <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> uh did you get to watch it
 	
 	
 		no i didn't i uh have been at my computer <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all day</TIMEX> so
 	
 	
 		oh are you a Cowboy fan
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well i used to be a real big <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cowboy</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fan</ENAMEX> and and uh
 		i'm not at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jimmy Johnson</ENAMEX>'s fan
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		being an Okie

 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		they've always been you know my favorite
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but uh and and i guess i still have a soft spot i just hate that that's the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coach</ENAMEX>  that's leading them so now have they they're in the play-offs right
 	
 	
 		yet
 		
 
 		right
 		right
 		yeah they made it to the play-offs finally like just you know <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years ago</TIMEX> they were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> and fifteen they won like just one game
 		and so it's a pretty fast turn around but <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> they made it to play-offs and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> was their <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> game and they beat the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chicago Bears</ENAMEX>
 		so everybody's really going crazy you know down here
 	
 	
 		i'll bet they are
 	
 	
 		they're going crazy so
 		so they turned it around but yeah they have a lot of young exciting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX> now up
 		i mean everybody was real upset you know when they fired <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Landry</ENAMEX> but you know now it's like you know they're doing good so everybody's forgotten about that
 	
 	
 		uh at football <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fans</ENAMEX> are probably the most fickle <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in the world
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
