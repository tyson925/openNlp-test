 
     		
 	
 		uh let's see personal computers
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		so do you use them
 	
 	
 		uh yes um we own one
 	
 	
 		terrific what kind
 	
 	
 		uh its an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Emerson</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">eighty eighty six um two</TIMEX> low density floppy drives and no hard drive yet
 		but uh you know it's it comes in mighty handy
 	
 	
 		mostly for word processing type things
 	
 	
 		uh yeah a big chunk of it's word processing we're also taking programming classes and uh so there's a fair amount of programming getting done on it but uh
 		the uh right now we got a project going we're trying to put um all my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>'s stray recipes on the disk
 	
 	
 		nice did you buy a program to handle menus
 	
 	
 		uh it came with a menus program but uh that doesn't it is maceboast excuse me mostly kind of a pain in the neck without a hard drive
 	
 	
 		oh yes
 	
 	
 		and hopefully sometime <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this spring</TIMEX> we'll be able to get <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> and get it configured
 	
 	
 		there's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eighty eighty eight</NUMEX> is what you said
 	
 	
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eighty eighty six</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eighty</NUMEX> oh gosh it's worth your time to just upgrade they're so darned cheap now
 	
 	
 		which
 	
 	
 		computers
 	
 	
 		ah
 		impoverished college student
 	
 	
 		oh no
 	
 	
 		this one went on a credit card and we got a way out while to pay it off yet so it's
 	
 	
 		
 
 		ah i've i've got <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> at home too it's a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">three eighty six thirty three megahertz forty four meg</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RAM RAM</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundred</NUMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> meg drive and
 	
 	
 		uh
 		oh that sounds nice
 	
 	
 		super VGA and yeah it's fun i do programming too my job is uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EDP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">auditor</ENAMEX> and so i'm into computers all the time
 	
 	
 		EDP
 	
 	
 		electronic data processing
 	
 	
 		okay
 		that sounds like a fine job
 	
 	
 		yeah i really enjoy it and it treats me well
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		uh what are you studying in college computers
 	
 	
 		ah computer engineering
 	
 	
 		how nice
 	
 	
 		well it's computer engineering technology uh which uh it's all i can understand is just this slightly more hands on version of computer engineering
 		but i've got a ways to go yet so far most of what i've done is getting gotten core classes out of the way taken some electronics classes
 		and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> in um with computer logic
 	
 	
 		how they work is fascinating to me
 	
 	
 		oh yes yeah i rather enjoy it myself  the uh <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lab</ENAMEX> for that uh um computer logic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> was a lot of fun
 	
 	
 		was it did you
 	
 	
 		yeah we got to hook up a few uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counters</ENAMEX> and and uh decoders encoders
 	
 	
 		hardware stuff huh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		what do you think of that fuzzy logic
 	
 	
 		i've not gotten a chance to work with it although um my uh my data structures <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> was telling us something about why how fudgy fuzzy logic works as far as the concept behind it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		now how you'd implement that uh software wise or mechanically i don't know but uh it sounds like a very impressive piece of piece of work
 	
 	
 		yeah they're pretty amazing
 		uh i've written a couple of programs for commercially uh
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		and it's a fun field
 	
 	
 		in the fuzzy logic direction
 	
 	
 		what no in uh
 		no just regular uh but you have to take into account you know with any computer program all the type of things <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> can do to you uh to make your program crash or things you normally don't consider
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		entering bad information of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sort</ENAMEX> or another and
 	
 	
 		yeah pushing certain keys certain times and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		messing up your files and things like that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and your gonna
 		be an engineer a computer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineer</ENAMEX> type
 	
 	
 		uh yeah well the what the computer well the CET program seems to be so far is just a broad based specialized from
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you get programming a fair fair amount of programming you get uh hardware you get uh
 		more or less uh
 		you get basic electronics <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX> that uh deal with
 		you know not only the digital circuitry but uh you know power supplies and and uh just the whole gamut but mostly towards uh computer electronics
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so the idea is that um you can go in a variety of directions from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CET</ENAMEX> major but i say i have more fun with the hardware than i do with the software
 		so you know i pretty much plan on i mean so far i'm planning to go in the engineering direction
 	
 	
 		i don't
 		that's good uh
