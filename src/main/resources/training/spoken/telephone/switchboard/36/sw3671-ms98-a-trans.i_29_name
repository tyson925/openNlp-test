 
     		
 	
 		what kind of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX> do you live in is it typical of the area
 	
 	
 		
 
 		the uh house i live in is fairly typical of the area it's one that uh my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> and i designed ourselves
 	
 	
 		how neat
 	
 	
 		and we've been living in it now for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty years</TIMEX> so it must be okay
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh we moved into our home <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about thirty three years ago</TIMEX>
 		and at the time it was a small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ranch</ENAMEX> style it had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedrooms</ENAMEX> on the main floor and then the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">basement</ENAMEX> wasn't finished but we have since finished the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">basement</ENAMEX> we've added a car <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX> and we've added a big family room
 	
 	
 		well in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> we don't have basements very often i'm surprised you do in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Utah</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh most most i would think most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Utah</ENAMEX> do
 		we live uh up against up by the mountains
 	
 	
 		so it's cold
 	
 	
 		yes we got about uh <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">three inches</NUMEX> of snow last night the snow plows have been out and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>'s been out shoveling the snow
 	
 	
 		ah
 	
 	
 		so uh but ours is is typical for the neighborhood but
 	
 	
 		it is it air-conditioned
 	
 	
 		no i have <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so you're cool enough you don't need the air-conditioning
 	
 	
 		no in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX> time for about oh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a month</TIMEX> we could use air-conditioning but i have <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX> and i don't i don't like air-conditioning
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		but we
 	
 	
 		well in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> you can't hardly live without it
 	
 	
 		i know i've been to my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX>'s in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August</TIMEX> and i hated it
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah we designed our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> so the western exposure has a minimum number of windows so that the air-conditioning bill will be cheaper
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh we had uh we have had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
 		and so our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> was small to start with but uh we added <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> basement <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedrooms</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">basement</ENAMEX> and like i say added on to it so
 		uh it's pretty typical did you have help designing it or was that part of what you do
 	
 	
 		no actually uh it we we just started and we didn't like any of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> we saw uh built they tended to have at the time we were building
 		very large uh bathrooms which i consider a waste of space since you spend so little time in the bathroom
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh also too much hall uh space we saw a home plan in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Better Homes and Gardens</ENAMEX> about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five years</TIMEX> before we built this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> that we liked
 		except uh we wanted it a little bigger than uh uh it had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedrooms</ENAMEX> that you could add on another bedroom
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and we wanted it arranged slightly differently
 		i think if you looked at the floor plan now uh you probably wouldn't recognize where we started from
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that's kind of the way ours is too
 	
 	
 		but uh my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> likes a lot of cabinets in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen</ENAMEX> and the original <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX> tried to talk us out of that and thank goodness we didn't let him talk us out of that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh we wanted an entry way so that the living room
 		did not have to be walked through
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		the previous place we had lived in you always walked through the living room to get any place in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and it was a traffic flow problem all the time
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so we have an entry way and i uh spend quite a little time in uh both when i was working and also even now retired
 		in the study where i have a computer so we wanted a separate study and we have that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and it has uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedrooms</ENAMEX> and we wanted it since our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> we raised my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>'s sister as our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> so in effect we had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> but uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		we wanted it so that we could leave the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> to them uh when they had <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> over and the normal noise that goes with such things so we have the
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		master <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedroom</ENAMEX> is arranged so that it is basically basically a separate <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> in itself it has its own bath has its own patio porch type thing sliding doors and a very large <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> with
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		a TV set so you could live back there by itself if you wanted to uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		uh that sounds lovely
 		i've always wanted uh another <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedroom upstairs</ENAMEX> and then i we've never had a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bathroom</ENAMEX> off the master <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedroom</ENAMEX> and i would like that
 	
 	
 		oh that's i don't know uh with our previous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX> didn't have it and uh
 		now that we've got it we we think we couldn't live without it you know
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well those are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> things that i would definitely i would add another <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedroom</ENAMEX> on the main floor i quilt a lot but
 	
 	
 		yeah my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> does also
 	
 	
 		oh does she
 	
 	
 		yeah and now with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> gone well she has a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">room</ENAMEX> reserved for her junk and i have one for my junk you know
 	
 	
 		well that would be the way to go
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh but like i say our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> live a long way away and so our family <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> i quilt in there a lot
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it's big enough that uh we it was eighteen by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty</TIMEX> when we added it on
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		so uh it's big enough for that but
