 
     		
 	
 		you keep a budget
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um yes i do
 	
 	
 		okay how how do you work that
 	
 	
 		well usually it works out pretty well
 	
 	
 		does it
 	
 	
 		um i try to project out um right now i project out <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six months</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		you know i have my fixed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</TIMEX> bills and i know how much they are
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right  uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh i have a percentage of my savings that i attempt to
 		take off the top
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		not unless i have something come up that's unusual that i was unexpected and then i may have to go into savings
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and
 	
 	
 		well that seems to work out pretty good
 	
 	
 		kind of the formula i use i use uh <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">ninety percent</NUMEX> of my check
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and then i retain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> percent and if i don't use it then it goes into savings also
 	
 	
 		for savings
 		oh is it is it hard to set it up for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the six month</TIMEX> period rather than just <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a month</TIMEX> or
 	
 	
 		well my <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</TIMEX> bills are pretty consistent you know you have your <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX> payments <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the same every month</TIMEX> uh car payments are the same you know when your insurance is due
 	
 	
 		oh
 		right
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		so in fact
 	
 	
 		so you budget all that in that's why a lot of times i only use <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">ninety percent</NUMEX> of my salary because <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">some months</TIMEX> i'll have insurance
 	
 	
 		it might
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times a year
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and i need that extra money and to take it out of savings at that point
 	
 	
 		oh so really when you're doing it it probably is just as easy to do it for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the six month</TIMEX> period rather than just <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a month</TIMEX> at a time oh
 	
 	
 		sure
 		um-hum <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a month</TIMEX> at a time is not a really a big picture of what's going on in your life because it doesn't give you any flexibility as far as uh unforeseen situations or something coming down the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> that you know is coming down the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> that you need to save for
 	
 	
 		no
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh right and then also i mean that's if you do it <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</TIMEX> that's twelve times you have to sit down and figure it out and you could save all that
 	
 	
 		yeah i do it uh twice <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> and um you know i could adjust it <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every month</TIMEX> that's no big deal
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but uh i just finished out <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December</TIMEX> and uh when i was done with it i threw it away and i already had <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January through July</TIMEX> made out
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		so you do it <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January to July</TIMEX> and then <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July to December</TIMEX> oh oh does now how did you say you worked your savings do you take your savings right off
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah
 		i take the savings right off the top i pay myself first
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i'm the type of individual that uh you know i can't
 		i have to put something back for myself to feel like i'm doing my job
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		right right
 	
 	
 		it's my motivator
 	
 	
 		and how much at what percentage do you save
 	
 	
 		i save about fifteen percent
 	
 	
 		oh that's great
 	
 	
 		out of what out of my savings account not as well as the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> do
 	
 	
 		well that that's fairly good do you get paid once <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a month</TIMEX> or by twice a month
 	
 	
 		twice a month uh uh actually every other week so <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty six</TIMEX> checks
 	
 	
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every two weeks</TIMEX>
 		during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> oh that's great we
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 		so twice <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> i pick up an extra check also
 	
 	
 		oh that's right so that helps out
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		gives you a bit there oh
 	
 	
 		how do you all do yours
 	
 	
 		well we
 		we don't really do very well we have never sat down and made out a formal budget we keep saying you know we're going to do this we're going to do this we we take our savings right out  right out <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> and put you know put it away and then
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		we just uh we're that's terrible but we just kind of spend what we need that's right that's right we take the savings out and uh you know put that in and then
 	
 	
 		spend what's left over huh
 	
 	
 		spend what what's left over like you said and i know we if we keep but we just don't know how to get down and get started i guess trying to decide how much goes where and you know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		there's really no certain formula that you can say well i i wanna say this much and i'm gonna spend this much for the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh i'm kind of in a situation right now that my our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> are grown and they're gone so uh
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		you know and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> is almost paid for so we're in pretty good shape
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh that's great now how did you get started when you started doing have you always done a budget or what
 	
 	
 		uh we've done them for about fifteen years
 	
 	
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about fifteen years</TIMEX> oh so quite a while huh did you just sit down and decide
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		this much is this much is gonna go here and
 		the thing we have a hard time with was you know like how much for the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">groceries</ENAMEX> and how much for the clothes and how much for
 	
 	
 		well
 		one thing we do about the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">groceries</ENAMEX> and when and we just got back from the grocery <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX> and we've been doing this for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a long time</TIMEX> and we know exactly how much we spend at the grocery <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX> because when we come home we write it down
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		oh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so in a given month
 		we know that we spent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two hundred</TIMEX> and fifty dollars or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">four hundred dollars</NUMEX> or whatever it is and if it's <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">four hundred dollars</NUMEX> we look at it and say well why did we spend <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">four hundred dollars</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and we spent <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">four hundred dollars</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this month</TIMEX> because or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last month</TIMEX> because uh we had <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several Christmas</TIMEX> parties
 	
 	
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December</TIMEX> right right
 	
 	
 		so but we know approximately how much our our <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</TIMEX> grocery bill is you know and and you should be able to do that too within
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> or fifteen percent of what uh what you spend once you get a track record
 	
 	
 		right
 		if we just
 		huh so
 	
 	
 		and once you establish your track record
 	
 	
 		so what
