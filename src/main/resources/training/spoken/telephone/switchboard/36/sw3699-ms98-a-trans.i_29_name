 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay uh do you live in a home
 	
 	
 		yes we we it's a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> we bought uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about two and a half years ago</TIMEX> now
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 		oh did you uh-huh we've we've lived in ours for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about six years</TIMEX> we had it built actually and um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh the first house
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah it it's our <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> home too
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh</ENAMEX> so what do you think of of owning a home as opposed to
 	
 	
 		yeah huh
 	
 	
 		to renting somebody else's
 	
 	
 		um well before we built our home we were managing some <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartments</ENAMEX> that we were living in and um that was quite an experience
 	
 	
 		huh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i i much prefer having my own home and and uh just the space and and more privacy
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		do you have is it a fairly large house
 	
 	
 		um it's uh oh it's like twenty <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">four fifty square feet</NUMEX> it's a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> story yeah how about yours
 	
 	
 		oh that's a pretty good size yeah uh-huh
 		it's tiny  it's not much bigger actually we had an apartment <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedroom apartment</ENAMEX> that was about as big as this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> is so yeah it's uh it's only like <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eleven</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">hundred square feet</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		is it small
 		oh really
 		oh uh-huh do you do you have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> yeah but it it uh all the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> are small i i mean but it ends up giving us <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedrooms</ENAMEX> which we wanted yeah and uh use an extra <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> for an office
 	
 	
 		just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> huh oh
 		oh uh-huh yeah
 	
 	
 		which is handy i'd rather have have more <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> and less space in each <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> i guess rather have lots of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> and lots lots of space but uh that ends up costing me
 	
 	
 		oh yeah yeah well like um how does it compare to the ones in your neighborhood
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well they're the it's pretty typical i mean it's it's a very very middle class neighborhood uh lots of lots of young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couples</ENAMEX> with you know usually oh i'm sure that virtually everybody in the neighborhood that's their <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> and uh
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		lots of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> and and stuff and so it it fits well in the neighborhood it's it's certainly not a real upscale neighborhood but on the other hand it's clean and kind of suburban
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		little bit more than i want
 	
 	
 		yeah uh
 	
 	
 		is is yours also pretty much in conformance with a neighborhood or is it
 	
 	
 		um yeah it it it it does it it seems about oh probably average um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		that our neighborhood has a just a wide variety of of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">um people</ENAMEX> and you know there's older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> here and and um
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that are about our age we're in our <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirties</TIMEX> and um there's a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids people</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> have eight
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		uh-huh wow <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> oh my gosh
 	
 	
 		yeah uh-huh yeah their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> just burned down matter of fact and um <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last summer</TIMEX> and they're just rebuilding and um their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> is going to be really big  they're
 	
 	
 		ooh
 		i'm sure with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> gosh
 	
 	
 		yeah they're building it up bigger he's at um uh oh not an obstetrician an an orthopedic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">surgeon</ENAMEX> and um so since the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX> did burn they're they're going it's quite different than it was before and it's it's a lot bigger
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and um but ours is about it's you know it's a nice nice <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> it's it's definitely not one of the the smaller ones and um it's not the biggest either but
 	
 	
 		yeah neighborhoods i mean they'll they'll they'll tend to to be real tight about that uh especially newer neighborhoods my my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> just built a new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> uh um he he lives in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wichita Kansas</ENAMEX>
 		and the um
 		uh the neighborhood actually fought him on it because he he was um the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> was gonna cost less to build than any other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> in the neighborhood
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		now that's because he was he's doing a lot of it himself and you know for example landscaping and and lots of the other stuff and his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> actually ends up being nicer than lots of other in the neighborhood but but they were they were pretty touchy on it he was a little surprised
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah you
 		you know that's interesting you say that because we do have we have those architectural codes here and when we um put our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> in um they wanted us to have there was one
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		we have part siding it on on the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> story part and then on the back and they there was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> side where our chimney was and just the chimney was gonna be brick and they wanted us to have more brick so we ended up having to go halfway up
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		which it does look nicer and you know we would have liked to have had all brick but of course at that point we couldn't afford it and
 		but it's funny that you'd say that because there were <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> in here that didn't have any brick at all so it's kind of like they were
 	
 	
 		right
 		kind of depends on when they get in you know
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah and i and so it was kind of like it's they ours is the last <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> that they built on so the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> actually on our street are a little bit they've kind of gone a little bit nicer
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		oh they have it's got yeah yeah oh
 	
 	
 		yeah i mean just they you know it's like the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> phase and and so they've kind of changed the the codes a little bit and so that's kind of why i guess they stuck us with more brick when there were other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> that didn't have any and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		hum
 		well my see my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> kind of got in the opposite end of that because they they moved into a neighborhood and bought a a real nice stone <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> down in in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Austin</ENAMEX> and um
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and  what the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">builder</ENAMEX> apparently plans to do is they they do phase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> and they they kind of give it a very upscale and and very tightly controlled um codes and and and stuff and then they come back in and and and then they sell
