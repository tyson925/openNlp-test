 
     		
 	
 		well what do you think about uh funding yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 		space exploration
 		well the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX> program i think has been very beneficial for this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> and and and a lot of the household goods and stuff that we have <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> i think has come out of that program
 	
 	
 		i do too um i have been a a big <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">supporter</ENAMEX> for  i guess since the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> grade when i uh watched uh
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">uh John Glenn</ENAMEX> orbit the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX> you know and uh been fascinated with it since then and i think it's just in a uh just a great source of national pride
 	
 	
 		oh yeah yeah
 		well and and i i was gonna say you you and i probably grew up at that time where we uh benefitted by the the emotion and the
 		that the program provided all of us you know really got wrapped up in what was going on
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		the cost however i will have to admit that i look at some of the uh
 		problems that we're facing as a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> and i'm not sure that we can continue to devote nearly the dollars that we've been devoting over the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		well  you know whenever i i look at uh the way our our our federal dollars are spent and uh really the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX> program takes
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		a fairly small amount of that if you look at a percentage basis and i think that there are so many other areas that we are
 	
 	
 		that's true that's true
 	
 	
 		uh throwing money away that really have you know we we don't see anything for it and i can see i can see something from my tax dollars uh in the space program and uh i don't know i i
 		i for one wouldn't wouldn't take a dime away from them if anything i think i would like to see uh uh more money spent uh uh with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX> and less on other programs
 	
 	
 		um-hum well and i was gonna say there are some other areas they could cut you know i don't they wouldn't necessarily have to cut it out of there
 	
 	
 		yeah but uh no i used to uh  you know think that golly it'd be great to uh
 		to fly on on the space shuttle of course that was up until the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Challenger</ENAMEX> incident and uh really brought to to light that you know and uh really we had lead we had led a charmed life uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		in think in thinking that nothing could go wrong or any of these things yeah
 	
 	
 		right right and just you know in relying you know just saying gosh you know we really are just super <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">duper</ENAMEX> and then you know that proved hey uh we were fallible and i mean it was one of those things where it was tragic and yet
 		eventually it had to happen i mean it had gotten to the point that you know the space shuttle launches were just so commonplace  and yeah and and you know it just you know relegated to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">page</ENAMEX> of the newspaper uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum they really were
 	
 	
 		but still i i mean it's hard for me to imagine that um spaceflight is something that is going to really be within our reach uh you know or or commonplace for the average <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> i mean
 	
 	
 		yeah i i don't see that happening either although i would tell you that in a in a heartbeat i would go along
 	
 	
 		yeah i well well i i tell you i've flown practically everything but the space shuttle
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and uh i it would be hard for me to turn it down if if there was if the offer was there uh they say it it really is something the the one of the things though that i think that's so
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		incredibly valuable about the space shuttle we have here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Houston</ENAMEX> uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMAX</ENAMEX> theater
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh that has you know this tremendous huge screen and they had a program called uh Planet <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX> that was made up of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">um just about an hour</TIMEX> show and it was all uh footage filmed from outer space of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and it was spectacular and it it i think that it helps
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		you know perhaps and i hope that it does makes more and more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> aware of you know the fact that uh we live on a fragile
 		you know a fragile planet and that it it's important to take a global view and what better way to to do that to to see it up on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX> i mean from outer space
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true well and we're probably going to be the only <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> for some time now that could possibly afford or be uh far enough along to continue with this kind of a program you know with with the USSR crumbling at this point
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well and then again well and then again it's one of the few things that we continue to lead in
 	
 	
 		that's true that's real true
 	
 	
 		and and i hate to see us sacrifice something that we've got uh an edge on but um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the things that was interesting out of that out of that program that they said that uh they compared um uh
 		photographs of different parts of the ocean over uh the course of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fifteen</ENAMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty years</TIMEX> uh from previous uh uh flights
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and uh they could document the change in the color of the ocean and whether that had to do with a change in plankton because of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ozone</ENAMEX> or the the rising temperature or whatever but um yeah
 	
 	
 		of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> yeah
 	
 	
 		but it was interesting that you know you could they could even see from up there how we're changing our environment in in such you know an incredibly short time
 	
 	
 		oh yeah yeah well the capabilities from a uh uh uh reconnaissance basis whether that be for peaceful operations like you just described or military whatever is phenomenal from that altitude
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh their ability to to eavesdrop or to to photograph or to uh is just phenomenal
 	
 	
 		it's awesome whenever i i i've read the stories about and you know and heard things about some of the the the things that the satellites can do from up there as far as photography's concerned i mean it's they said that they can
