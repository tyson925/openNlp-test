 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		you're in a little different situation i think we're going to set the record in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> for murders
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yes uh
 	
 	
 		there's been a lot
 	
 	
 		yes uh the uh and they're mostly <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> linked here but
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		we have
 		
 
 		um i really i think we had like <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four hundred</NUMEX> and eighty
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> a day
 	
 	
 		my word is that an increase over any of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the previous years</TIMEX> is that the highest
 	
 	
 		oh yeah it just keeps going higher and higher we're going to have a we're going to set a record for us but possibly will be the deadliest place to live in the nation
 	
 	
 		my word
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		in the whole nation
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		wow that's terrible does that does that worry you at all
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		extremely i carry tear gas yeah
 	
 	
 		do you that's great do you are you out alone at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> often or
 	
 	
 		that not for for that reason no
 	
 	
 		oh now does now is it mostly in certain areas that it happens or just
 	
 	
 		oh yes um you know crime is um
 		i think crimes against property are more common uh you know they're common fairly common all over uh
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know the some it's kind of funny uh we've just moved from a a low crime area because it's got great <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> to a higher crime area
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		but
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		i had a i had a pickup <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">truck</ENAMEX> sitting out by my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> with uh all my furniture in it for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a week</TIMEX> and it wasn't touched
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		my word huh
 	
 	
 		so i don't know what you define as uh you know uh for being in an unsafe a less safe area
 	
 	
 		right
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it's there no telling uh
 	
 	
 		my word huh well that i know that um we're a little bit in the same <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Salt Lake City</ENAMEX> is
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about an hour</NUMEX> away from us and they have had an increase a big increase in the number of murders <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> too and they said that um
 		the murders have been on the rise where some of the other crimes have either stayed the same or declined but the more violent crimes like rapes and murders
 		have you know increased and i and i think like you said it's a lot linked to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> to the drug
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		scene and um of course the little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> we live in we don't  have too many
 	
 	
 		you don't well you have it believe me but you might not you don't it's not as prevalent i don't
 	
 	
 		right right i'm sure that there's
 		uh we do have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">policeman</ENAMEX> you know that that runs the
 		that is the law enforcement here and um
 	
 	
 		one
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		we're real small and he's only been hired for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about a year before</TIMEX> that we didn't even have one
 	
 	
 		
 
 		how big what's the population
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um i think there's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">seventy families</ENAMEX> and i'm not sure
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight hundred</NUMEX> maybe <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">seven hundred seven hundred or eight hundred</NUMEX> is the population
 	
 	
 		well the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> who might snort <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocaine</ENAMEX> in town probably isn't very violent
 	
 	
 		so
 		no  no we do have um
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		just up to the south of us there's an area called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Docks Flat</ENAMEX> and it's up in the mountains and a lot of the the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> go up there for their beer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> and that and that's probably the biggest problem we have right here in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX> is is these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> coming up up a canyon here and going up south for that kind of a thing and that brings a lot of
 	
 	
 		are they local
 	
 	
 		no no they're from
 		oh from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> around us
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		mostly so so they're not in town <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX> and that that brings in a lot of problems spots
 		but um have you ever been the victim of any type of a crime whether a burglary or
 	
 	
 		oh i had a i had a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two eighty or three hundred</NUMEX> Z <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> that uh i used to have the windows replaced on that that i say <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times though
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		you're kidding
 	
 	
 		they were stolen from i have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> dogs three large barking fierce looking not fierce but fierce looking dogs
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		
  
 		oh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		that um that sleep very soundly it would appear but uh just from my driveway
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh oh that's a good idea
 		that probably deters a lot of
 	
 	
 		oh well my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">truck</ENAMEX> i was telling you about was next to the dog pen
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh  that was probably the reason
 	
 	
 		but
 		i think it does but it's um that you know these are nice they don't they don't catch a lot of things
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		i think if it's uh
 		if someone's coming to case your <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and they knock on the door they're going to draw a response from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> but if someone walked around my house
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		my <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> sleep so soundly during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> too that they wouldn't know
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh well do you um do you have signs posted that you know say
 	
 	
 		yeah i've got signs that say my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> is protected by a security system
 	
 	
 		oh that's good
 	
 	
 		they're lies but you know
 	
 	
 		it might deter them well they say that that deters a lot a lot of would be you know burglaries
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that what's a what's a crime like there
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um
 		i'd probably have to go to one of the bigger
