 		well how fun
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it used to be my favorite movie when i was little so i went back and
 	
 	
 		oh now i wonder that's not not out on video is it
 	
 	
 		i don't think so
 	
 	
 		i wonder if that'll be the next one they release maybe if that's
 	
 	
 		i don't know but you know we went for a dollar it was fun
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		i really enjoyed it i didn't get bored or anything either
 	
 	
 		oh now now did you like do you like the little theater where you go and and watch the movies
 	
 	
 		yeah we have a real nice one it's brand new
 	
 	
 		
  
 		oh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and um i i suspect it'll be a full priced theater when this highway goes in but right now it's almost in the middle of nowhere
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so it's not very crowded and it's real inexpensive and it's brand new so it's it's a really nice place to go
 	
 	
 		hm
 		oh
 		well that's fun yeah we we our little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> doesn't have a movie <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">theater</ENAMEX> but we the nearest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> has a um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		they have it's a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> you know <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">theaters</ENAMEX> in one that has the different shows going on
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>

 		no huh-uh
 		i don't know i think my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>'ll want to see it so i'll do the same thing i'll wait till it's less expensive
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		because he said when he went to see <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Star Trek</ENAMEX> he was out in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> he said it was like <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> fifty a person
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		wow my word and what how much is it for a movie there where you're at
 	
 	
 		i think it's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about six</NUMEX> dollars yeah
 	
 	
 		is it we were when we went it was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">four fifty four fifty</NUMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> and that seems like a real lot to me even
 	
 	
 		wow
 		yeah well i think you can get that maybe on a matinee here but
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		you know about <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">six dollars</NUMEX> is what they're running and that's why i don't normally go to them
 	
 	
 		
  
 		boy
 		boy i'll say not that's a that's a chunk we usually get go ahead and get the discount tickets but i don't think they were accepting them on <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">on Star Trek</ENAMEX> or you know some of the newer ones i guess they don't
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		to try and make their money and so so do you watch do you enjoy movies or
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah we usually go usually every <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekend</TIMEX> we go to one yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		do you oh that's fun so you've seen you have a wide variety under your belt then right
 	
 	
 		yeah well we never used to do that until this other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">theater</ENAMEX> went in and it's you know it's inexpensive and it's entertainment for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		right right
 	
 	
 		and um the only thing is that when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> at work talk about the current movies i don't know what's going on but
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four weeks later</TIMEX> i will
