 
     		
 	
 		all right now then we should be ready to go with our conversation
 	
 	
 		
 
 		all right
 	
 	
 		what are your preferences
 	
 	
 		i think i tend to prefer ethnic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> rather than steak <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> or uh simply <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> or or even the southwest food
 		uh frequently we enjoy trying a a new kind of a place and to try to see what their style of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> is and what kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spices</ENAMEX> and things they use in it
 		so that's what me we mostly do what do you prefer when you go out
 	
 	
 		oh i've decided there's so many places in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> i will not make too many repeats and i thoroughly enjoy the ethnic foods
 	
 	
 		oh you do
 	
 	
 		yes certainly
 		course i perhaps would enjoy Tex-Mex
 		and that's uh a good <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tex-Mex</ENAMEX> is awfully hard to beat do you prefer do you care for that flavor
 	
 	
 		oh yes really very much um i think that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Tex-Mex</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> has become a kind of a a standard enjoyed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> in our home and i've
 		even learned to make a a few things at home myself and that's why i said sometimes when we go out i would
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		not because i don't like it but because we we tend to like it and even have it at home i'd rather try something else um-hum yeah uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i i i understand that uh but you don't care for the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steaks</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i'm not a big steak or rib or um roast <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beef</ENAMEX> eater although to be honest with you at holiday time at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Christmas</ENAMEX>
 		i always buy a a standing prime rib and make some <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Yorkshire pudding</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gravy</ENAMEX> and totally enjoy it and then can table that for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six months to eight months to another year</TIMEX> so
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> and you know we're trying not to eat those those big <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meats</ENAMEX> also with all of that health consciousness uh
 		believe me we're not <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fanatics</ENAMEX> in that line but uh if we enjoy other things then we'll we'll tend to go that way
 		a nice <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> once in a while is is very tasty and um we recently went to an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Ethiopian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX> and uh sampled that kind of food rather different
 		but uh have you been to any place lately that you enjoyed
 	
 	
 		yes i found a little place over in uh <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Preston Center</ENAMEX> tonight it's uh called oh i don't have the matches now but it's a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">its</NUMEX> a
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cafe au France</ENAMEX> and they had the it's a small place but most delightful i had not been there before
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh my
 	
 	
 		and then i found with a neighbor oh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about a month ago</TIMEX> this uh Salvadorian
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and that is on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thirty Five</ENAMEX>
 		in a i don't think it was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Day</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inn Motel</ENAMEX> but this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> had been there <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two or three</NUMEX> times and their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> is excellent
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		is that right
 	
 	
 		except for their fried <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">banana</ENAMEX> now i do not care for that
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh my uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but uh the the other things the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seasonings</ENAMEX> were so appealing
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh wait i have a call just a second
 	
 	
 		okay go ahead
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i'm sorry  i didn't know i'd have that one come in but anyway
 	
 	
 		that
 		okay
 	
 	
 		that was it was very good and very very reasonable
 	
 	
 		oh good
 	
 	
 		good service and the things that i look forward to i mean i want to be waited on i don't want to go cafeteria style
 	
 	
 		right um-hum
 	
 	

 		i'd rather have them cater to me when i'm when i'm patronizing them and
 	
 	
 		um-hum when you go out i
 		um-hum i don't blame you i i think that's an important part of relaxing that you don't have to do the work yourself um-hum
 	
 	
 		the only time that i would go against that is would be the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> brunches that so many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">places</ENAMEX> have
 	
 	
 		oh
 		do you have a preference to a place for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> brunch
 	
 	
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> that i have enjoyed and had the privilege of eating there <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">New Year</TIMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Eve</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marriott</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Six Thirty Five</TIMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coit</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh yes i'm familiar with that um-hum
 	
 	
 		have you been there to eat
 	
 	
 		well i have not really been there to have the brunch um-hum
 	
 	
 		well they had a buffet dinner which was very similar
