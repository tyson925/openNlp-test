 
     		
 	
 		okay um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		some of the TV shows i like to watch are um mostly <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening evening</TIMEX> shows and uh like for instance the one i'm looking forward to to <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">tonight</TIMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twenty Twenty</NUMEX>
 		i usually watch those <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">prime time</TIMEX> programs
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh i like to watch <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Forty Eight Hours</ENAMEX> never miss that and uh sometimes <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Prime Time Live um</ENAMEX>
 		and then <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the week</TIMEX> goes by and i don't think ever watch anything else you know the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Sunday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> movies i watch those kind of things
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but uh mostly but basically a lot of documentary things and you know what's going on and that kind of thing
 	
 	
 		i like i have a few you know favorite shows that i try not to miss L <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A Law</ENAMEX> is one of them although <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX>'s
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it's a little easier to miss than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> with the new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cast</ENAMEX> and everything and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah it's hard to follow
 	
 	
 		right and uh i like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosie O'Neil</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh i've never seen that one
 	
 	
 		The Trials of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosie O'Neil</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sharon</ENAMEX> Gleese
 	
 	
 		okay yeah i've seen a uh the previews for that
 	
 	
 		she
 		it's very good it it's probably very much a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>'s movie uh show
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but uh and then there's a new sitcom on that is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tim Allen</ENAMEX>'s uh what is it uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Handyman</ENAMEX> that's not what uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Home Improvement</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh we never miss that or we try not to miss that
 	
 	
 		it's hysterical isn't it  did you catch the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Christmas</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh we think it is so funny
 		oh i just part of it
 	
 	
 		i thought it was you know and it had such a good story too did you see the end of it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		no
 	
 	
 		well you know the little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> the little one was trying to decide if there was a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Santa Claus</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh-huh oh that's right and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX> they thought it was the neighbor
 	
 	
 		they thought it was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX> and he gave the two doubting <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomases</ENAMEX> a rubber <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> and a paper clip
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		i thought that was wonderful
 	
 	
 		and then uh it it's it appeared that maybe it probably wasn't the neighbor
 	
 	
 		and uh on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> used to be on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">nights</TIMEX> now i can't figure out where they've moved it on our uh public television they had a show at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten thirty</TIMEX> that was a computer show
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and it showed the latest uh developments from all the computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh-huh i've never seen that program
 	
 	
 		well you know it's unless you're really into computers you wouldn't and software you probably wouldn't be interested but
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i don't know it just really gave me kind of an outlook of what was available out there
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and uh you know what
 		
 
 		uh they they covered everything from entertainment to spreadsheets you know and then they also the hardware
 	
 	
 		oh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so you you could see what the new developments were and what to look for and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i enjoyed that it was just a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minute</TIMEX> show with no commercials
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		it's public television course doesn't have the commercials during the show so
 	
 	
 		yeah right
 	
 	
 		and i like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Frugal Gourmet</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh i do too
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		oh i do too uh but i just seem to to miss a lot of these programs i don't know why i just
 	
 	
 		i
 	
 	
 		if i can catch them i do or if i remember
 	
 	
 		well there's very few that you know my life would stop if i didn't catch
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		now i do before i go to work i tape my soap opera
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i watch <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> and
 	
 	
 		well i watch <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> but one's <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a half hour</TIMEX> and one's <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an hour and</TIMEX> and they lead into each other
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and that's <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Bold and the Beautiful and As the World Turns</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		and i've watched the As the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World Turns</ENAMEX>
 		since i was a little girl
 	
 	
 		yeah that's been on for years
 	
 	
 		so it's just you know it's it's something i've done for the last probably <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty five years</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh and so you get to come home
 		and watch them
 	
 	
 		yes and i don't have anyone else at home so i have freedom to watch whatever i want
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but i like i like every i like the uh
 		the information shows and i like the comedies and you know and i i do like good movies i prescribed subscribe to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H B O</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah well we
 	
 	
 		so i can get some of the movies
 	
 	
 		yeah that's a good idea we did have H B <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> but it we just canceled it <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX> because it seemed like it was so repetitious you know it's just
 	
 	
 		it is
 		but i don't sleep a whole lot and i you know at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two o'clock in the morning</TIMEX> there isn't anything on <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">regular</TIMEX> TV and
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and uh  so that's and
 	
 	
 		oh yes if you're up then
 	
 	
 		you don't get good reception without cable and it doesn't cost that much more to have one of the pay <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right
 		right
 	
 	
 		that's primarily why i have it right now
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		i i thought when i got my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V C</ENAMEX> R i'd probably drop it you know but that was years
