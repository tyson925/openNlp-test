 
     		
 	
 		um what do you feel about child care
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well fortunately my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> are
 		pretty much beyond that
 	
 	
 		mine are too but i think it's a real real a real serious situation for a lot of people
 	
 	
 		it certainly is
 	
 	
 		and i don't you know a lot about it where where you're working for this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> department
 	
 	
 		yes um our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YMCA</ENAMEX> has after school child care um at several of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> so that they don't even have to you know go anywhere yeah
 	
 	
 		leave the school uh-huh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">um</ENAMEX> and then for other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> that they don't have it at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> they have it at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX>
 		and they pick them up in a a you know a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">van</ENAMEX> or whatever i think it kind of depends on how many
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		well you're probably in a more uh oh what we we live in a rural rural area
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		and so i think most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> around here that have to leave their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> leave them with uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> you know in a home situation
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		um-hum um-hum well that's always nice too i did that when <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mine</ENAMEX> were were littler
 	
 	
 		so
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		the uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">first couple of years</TIMEX> that i i worked <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">only halftime</TIMEX> when my <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> was born and and he just stayed with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> or somebody that maybe had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> you know his age
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">um</ENAMEX>  and that always seemed to work out real well and you know when somebody would decide to quit or something i always
 		felt real panicky
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but always seemed to manage to find somebody that i thought was just as wonderful as the other one you know so it seemed to work out
 	
 	
 		yeah did you
 		have you worked all the time your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> were little
 	
 	
 		um uh when i had my <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> one i stayed home for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three and a half years</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and then and then went back
 	
 	
 		so but that's about the time then they could go into a preschool situation
 	
 	
 		right right unfortunately the preschool that i wanted the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> one to go to because my <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> one had
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		is a preschool that does not have any day care at all but it's such a wonderful preschool so i had to find somebody else to keep them and then and then somebody to take them there
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so that's always another problem
 	
 	
 		oh yes uh you know i don't know how <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> we it's pretty cold here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Utah</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the winter</TIMEX> and i think i just think it would be so hard to have to get a child up a baby
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and take it in the cold to someone <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early in the morning</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		right yep
 	
 	
 		i think that that i would let i think i would sooner have it in someone in the home taking care of it
 	
 	
 		um-hum but then that's awfully expensive too
 	
 	
 		in a home
 	
 	
 		yeah well i mean if so you have someone come into your home
 	
 	
 		oh yes uh-huh to come into your <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> but i
 	
 	
 		you know that
 		that would be real nice but just almost almost cost prohibitive prohibitive you know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yes unless you can get could get a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a nanny</NUMEX> or something that i know a lot of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> here go off as nannies
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and stay in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> and take care of them after they've graduated from high school not a lot but some of them
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but uh i think that'd be an ideal situation i've never had to to uh work out of the home i've had we had uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and they just
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i would just  i was just here with them
 	
 	
 		well you just worked period huh  if you had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		right  and right  well there was seventeen <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> between them but that uh yeah well i just i just really that's what i wanted to do you know and but i know that my
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spouses</ENAMEX> and i have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> and uh
 	
 	
 		oh  where did the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> come
 	
 	
 		in the middle uh-huh we kept trying  but uh the our our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> or none of them have worked very much while their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> have been little
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">middle</ENAMEX>
 		oh that's good
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so but uh we have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fourteen</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandchildren</ENAMEX> so
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		this is i i feel lucky that they have not had to go out of the home
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		because i i  i don't know i just think that those <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">first two or three years</TIMEX> and then again in high school they they need their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> there
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true yeah that is true well how <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cold</ENAMEX> is it up there
 	
 	
 		so
 		uh it's in the  how <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cold</ENAMEX> is it honey right now
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty eight</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh okay well it's about fifty here so  uh no it's quit yeah it was bad there for a little bit but uh anyway
 	
 	
 		is it still raining
 		oh good are you
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		what do you do in the school district do you
 	
 	
 		i'm a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">librarian</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh well that's be interesting i love books
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah i liked that a lot and i kind of wanted to continue it even though my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> were you know when they were born but like i said i was able to stay home for
 	
 	
 		so
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		those <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three years</TIMEX> so it made a difference
 	
 	
 		well i think if you're trained and i think if you feel it within yourself that you want to be out  you know and you you have uh
 		you have the ability and stuff that's great there were times when i would have loved to have got you know uh-huh to left to have left my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> and you know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		to get out yeah that's true i think
 		and everybody feels that way at times at least
 	
 	
 		i'm sure they do
 	
 	
 		and then also that you'd love to be home  at
 	
 	
 		i'm sure that's so too
 	
 	
 		at other times but uh one thing i think it does do is it it it forces  it forces you to make your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> be organized and
 	
 	
 		and i think it makes them more independent um-hum
 	
 	
 		and independent that's right that
