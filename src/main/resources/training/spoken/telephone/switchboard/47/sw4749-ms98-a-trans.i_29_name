 
     		
 	
 		now um we're driving a nineteen <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eighty five</NUMEX> uh <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Buick Park Avenue</ENAMEX> that's still on the road
 	
 	
 		
 
 		you must have a family
 	
 	
 		yeah  it's uh it it's an interesting <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> with all sorts of problems that crop up now that it's in it's <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">seventh</NUMEX> year
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh like anytime anything happens it's immediately <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">five hundred dollar</NUMEX> repair or
 	
 	
 		
 
 		ooh
 	
 	
 		what have you so i uh you know in looking for the next <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> that we get here we're gonna look for something that has a very good track record that
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		isn't going to cost us a bundle every time something goes wrong
 	
 	
 		well i can tell you about reliability the last <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> i've had have both been <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Honda Accords</ENAMEX>
 		and uh i mean it's probably it's not a huge car but it's been very reliable and uh i was just very impressed by it
 		uh when i <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> looked at it and when i talked to other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that had <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hondas</ENAMEX> they cost a little more and when i was looking for them the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealer</ENAMEX> just wouldn't negotiate at all because they're such a big demand but
 		it had all the features i needed the uh you know the power and the uh adjustability and power windows and things like that
 		and the dashboard just looked good to me it was just no nonsense had the the speedometer uh speedometer and the tach and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> of other little gauges like engine heat but none of the you know big flashy electronic stuff
 	
 	
 		yeah i i've continually i've come to learn in having this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> that it was fully loaded when we got it and the problem is it's the fully loaded gives the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> more chances for things to go wrong
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		that make it not drivable and  i'd heard good things about the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hondas</ENAMEX> uh especially the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Accord</ENAMEX> um
 		but uh you know we've been we've been we've been an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> car <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> for the most part for um a long time not because of any great desire to like wow we're just going to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> because it's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		but but i don't know it's just been traditional type of uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Motors</ENAMEX> type of car the last <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> we had was a um
 		um a <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Grand Prix</ENAMEX> which never again
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		that was a nightmare that one that i mean the thing just literally fell apart as time went on
 	
 	
 		God well it's well if you like <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> it's a good thing that they're getting better i'll tell you that you
 	
 	
 		yeah it's it's been you know the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the Park Avenue</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> that's come out you know being a very high end type car uh they put a lot into it <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> but the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eighty five</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		apparently was a problem year for them because
 		they you know what's happened is most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have just gotten rid of them as soon as you know they pass the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three year</TIMEX> mark and things start going they go and buy a new car
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		well with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Northeast</ENAMEX> and the recession up here
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know that's certainly not an easy option and  uh we've kind of stuck with it trying to keep it you know we figure sooner or later we'll probably replace everything on the silly thing and
 	
 	
 		maybe it'll work right then huh
 	
 	
 		yeah i know know then when one of the doors fall off then it's time to get a new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> you know
 	
 	
 		
 
 		great yeah well <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> is supposed to be when if you're looking at reliability <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX>'s supposed to be one of the best <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> right now
 		and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> the uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> advantage <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> advantage <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> big advantage they still have is you can typically find them for a lot less
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so anyway but uh
 		some of the other things i like about well some of the things i don't like usually are um the flashy stuff you know the all the doors lock when you do something or uh um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i used to now i'm getting more to where i think i might like a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a</TIMEX> sun roof on my next car
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i'm not really sure about that because i'm very much a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> who uh likes to drive around with every with all the windows closed and the air conditioning on so i can hear my stereo well
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but you know so a sun roof or or a tee top or something like that you're just going to have to crank the stereo up to compete with the wind noise
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well you're in a climate that's a little bit more  where you have need the air conditioning more than we do up here
 	
 	
 		you bet they don't sell any <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> down here without it you know
 	
 	
 		yeah see up here it's it's definitely definitely an option type thing because we only have <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about three months</TIMEX> of really hot weather
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		everything else is fairly moderate then we have the world famous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rochester</ENAMEX> slash <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buffalo</ENAMEX> winters
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so a sun roof is really a snow roof you know ooh look snow
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah great
 	
 	
 		i mean i think what else you're going to see you know  looking up at your doom as the snow comes pummeling down but
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh no
 	
 	
 		well that's the other thing is a car needs to be able to handle the salt up here that they pour on the roads
 	
 	
 		that's right right
 	
 	
 		and that's what kills <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> up here is you know the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX> rusts them out and then they die <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> before you you know a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> might be undrivable
 	
 	
 		right or or they they die of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">rust years</TIMEX> before their major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">systems</ENAMEX> would otherwise go out
 	
 	
 		yeah that's that's what happened basically to our last <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> i mean it just this rust took over and
