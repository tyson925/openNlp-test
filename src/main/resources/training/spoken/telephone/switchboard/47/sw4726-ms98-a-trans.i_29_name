 
     		
 	
 		i'm ready if you are
 	
 	
 		
 
 		okay um where uh where do you stand uh
 	
 	
 		well i think that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> should be allowed to have them especially if they go hunting which my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> goes hunting he goes <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">deer</ENAMEX> hunting he goes <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">duck</ENAMEX> hunting
 	
 	
 		on
 		oh you
 	
 	
 		uh he's read books about <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX> since he was like probably <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eleven</NUMEX> or twelve years old
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i just think that uh as far as that's concerned he should be able to have them to go hunting with you know as far as just having handguns around to
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		to have them i don't believe that you should have handguns around
 	
 	
 		right yeah yeah yeah i agree too i um
 		it's it's as far as uh the ban goes and everything i don't think it's possible uh to completely ban <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX> there's just too many
 	
 	
 		well no there's too many sports <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> out there that that do do these things
 	
 	
 		right and i  yeah right i mean yeah that that's true and i mean the the technology's not that hard i mean you could make a gun you know from simple you know
 	
 	
 		yeah well i suppose you could uh
 	
 	
 		you know if if you really wanted a gun you could you could make one um
 	
 	
 		um-hum and i think if they want one they're going to get one you know
 	
 	
 		oh yeah sure that's true
 	
 	
 		the bad <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> are you know like i say if they want a gun they're going to find out or somehow to get one
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah yeah it's yeah i mean there's yeah there's there's no way to stop uh stop anybody from getting a gun um
 		i think there should be more control as like uh like maybe waiting periods and things like that you know uh
 	
 	
 		well i agree with you on that because i know uh in fact i had bought my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">rifle</ENAMEX> like for a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> present <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time and for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">rifle</ENAMEX> there's no waiting there wasn't anyhow now there might be now
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but there wasn't anything for you know <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">rifles</ENAMEX> and things like that i guess it was just handguns that there was a some kind of a waiting you know a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks</TIMEX> while they checked you out or something
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		sure
 		yeah
 		right
 	
 	
 		but uh most of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that's got these <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX> that's going around you know robbing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and shooting people
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah uh i i know my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> is uh really into <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX> and uh
 		uh we have went a couple of times with him to gun shows you know they come through <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> and everything and i mean they just have i mean they have anything you'd want i mean you know you know uh you know anywhere from <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">rifles</ENAMEX> and semiautomatic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and there's i mean there's nothing you can just go buy <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> and take it home and you know it's easier than getting uh like a video membership card at you know a video store
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i i see now i know they were having a gun show uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about a month ago</TIMEX> and i was just wondering how that did work if somebody wanted to buy a gun at a gun show
 	
 	
 		uh yeah yeah you just go and uh buy the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">gun</ENAMEX> and uh
 	
 	
 		there's no restriction though you don't have to wait or nothing then huh
 	
 	
 		no <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">well</ENAMEX> except for the the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pistols</ENAMEX> and i i'm not sure how they do that i know they used
 	
 	
 		yeah i was just curious you know because uh i know at at the regular gun show you know gun <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX> that you that you do have to wait for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pistols</ENAMEX> like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of weeks</TIMEX> and then they check you out then they call you up and you have go pick it up
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		right
 		yeah i think that's
 	
 	
 		which i think they have to do on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">rifles</ENAMEX> and things now too i think there is something something like that anyhow here out here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> i think there is now  but
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah yeah i'm not sure i'm not really sure but what uh the the gun laws in uh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pennsylvania Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> are like
 	
 	
 		um-hum  no  we don't have <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX> because we don't go hunting or anything like that but like i say my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> he's
 	
 	
 		no
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		he's always had a like a i think his first little rifle we got him was like he twelve or thirteen years old
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but he's always he went to the to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> to learn how to shoot it he goes to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pistol</ENAMEX> range and uh and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">rifle</ENAMEX> range to shoot them he likes to go to that uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">shotgun</ENAMEX> thing where you shoot at those um
 	
 	
 		oh yeah the skeets you mean
 	
 	
 		yeah right he likes to do that you know  but uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i don't know i think they should try to control it and everything you know but as far as just banning it completely there that's not going to happen
 	
 	
 		i don't yeah i don't i don't think it can happen either it i just don't i don't see and i i think uh hadn't thought about this before but if you do that if they would uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh decide to ban <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX> it would just open up a a market you know a black market for them
 	
 	
 		yeah right right
 	
 	
 		and so you know they they would just all the profits would go to you know
 	
 	
 		now i do believe though like in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> if a little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX> gets a hold of a gun that someone has i think they're liable now for it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh the
 	
 	
 		they can be you know put in jail and everything the whoever owned the gun
 	
 	
 		oh  the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">owner</ENAMEX>'s responsibility yeah
 	
 	
 		you know now when they have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> around you'd think that they would be locking them up or you know
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah yeah that's that's true um you know i had i had a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> who was a uh
 		a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">policeman</ENAMEX> in a in a in a local borough just a small uh
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the little neighborhoods you know one of the small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> uh near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX> and uh she said  that uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know he used to always keep his <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX> locked up and everything like that but i mean you know you're you know <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> make you know they forget or you know you know <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> get in the way <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> the way <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> are you know i mean they can
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know
 	
 	
 		well they can get into almost anything anymore
 	
 	
 		right yeah
