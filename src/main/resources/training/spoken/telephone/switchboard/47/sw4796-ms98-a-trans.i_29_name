 
     		
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">okay Randall</ENAMEX> uh uh do you have any special interest in uh space flight
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh yeah  ever since i was a young and uh used to watch the old uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apollo</ENAMEX> missions going off in uh classroom TVs
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh i suspect a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> uh uh got uh turned on by watching watching those go off uh very exciting
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		the uh
 		uh i've always i've always uh wanted wanted very much uh to uh be somehow involved in all that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh to uh meet and and to see see it actually happen of course i've really wanted to actually manage to get into space someday
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but uh that seems rather unlikely at this point unfortunately
 	
 	
 		what do you do now
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">programmer</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		unfortunately that can be done from the ground
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		to bad uh
 	
 	
 		yeah made the wrong wrong career choice to get up into space
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		the uh
 		uh
 		i used to think when i was when i was younger that uh by this time we'd have lots more in stuff in space than we do now
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh
 		frustrating at times
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i don't know what you think  about all that
 	
 	
 		well uh yeah i uh  i'm kind of young i'm <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only twenty two</NUMEX> and so uh
 		uh i'm not you know there's a lot that's happened in my lifetime as far as uh you know with the space shuttle and all
 		although plans to uh go to other planets have somewhat been thwarted in comparison to uh the sixties
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um although i have a  i i kind of wonder
 		uh if
 		some if it were possible to market some uh form of uh space technology you know to uh
 		uh to make it equitable it might severely help the economy you know in the in the
 		uh respect that  you know there's endless amounts of research to be done endless amounts of resources and and what not it would be great if we could find some way to to uh use that to boost the economy
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well
 		yeah well the uh
 		uh
 		i've always uh felt that uh uh one of the long term solutions that at least a few of our problems would be to have uh some sort of uh solar power satellites up
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> because that's a uh you know in singularly renewable resource that doesn't do it that doesn't require uh uh any particularly uh nasty environmental impact
 	
 	
 		exactly
 	
 	
 		and you can just get as much power as you need up there it's a matter of how big you build it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> and of course the side effects of this is that you have to have uh lunar mining <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX> and space <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stations</ENAMEX> and easy transport into space and no  things that i think we should be doing
 		so the side effects of doing that which i think would be good you know very very good for all for everyone in the long run is uh is it some of the other things i'd like to see happen would happen also
 	
 	
 		right yeah it seems like uh there's uh so you're talking about positive side effects then okay i understand
 	
 	
 		so
 		i'm
 		yeah right right um
 	
 	
 		sure that that makes a lot of sense
 	
 	
 		right the only problem is of course that uh that requires significant commitment from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to actually decide they want to put things like that up there
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and they want to do the research and uh they're all
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know no no one the only commitments that they're interested in making or even talking about are ones for flash value like uh the trip to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mars</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		right exactly
 	
 	
 		which is would would would produce some useful scientific research and so forth but
 		
 
 		the same money could probably be far better spent on uh uh lunar <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX> and solar power satellite research and and uh and uh so forth
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it it would be done it would be being done for the uh glitz and show factor
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		to get <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politician</ENAMEX>'s votes instead of instead of for for you know we should eventually send someone <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mars</ENAMEX> but not just because it's glitzy to do so
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		we should do it because  for the for the return we get for it and uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh unfortunately that's not why things happen
 	
 	
 		exactly
 	
 	
 		i i would settle for the glitz  for the glitz if the side effects were useful if they oh but uh
 	
 	
 		least nothing
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		the downside of that is that you after you do one of those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> say well we did it
 	
 	
 		right now we're done
 	
 	
 		now let's now we're done
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		no need to use this anymore to play around with this space stuff anymore that's what happened with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apollo</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah i think you're right
 	
 	
 		uh
 		but uh
 		i'd give almost anything to get into space
 	
 	
 		i would too i'd i'd uh it was it <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Denver</ENAMEX> that that tried to buy his way on to the space shuttle
