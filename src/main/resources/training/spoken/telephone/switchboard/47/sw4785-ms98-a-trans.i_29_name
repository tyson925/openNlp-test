 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> too
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 		the hat
 	
 	
 		oh you laugh how many what ages
 	
 	
 		well uh <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty seven</TIMEX> up
 	
 	
 		ah
 	
 	
 		and we had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		you've been through the fun part
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
 
 		and how about yourself
 	
 	
 		i have a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four and a half</NUMEX> and a three
 	
 	
 		oh well
 	
 	
 		so it's i i'm sure there's a lot of differences in the way in the way it's done now and then
 	
 	
 		yeah well
 		when <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mine</ENAMEX> were growing up i did some traveling and but not that extensively
 		but i always uh just made it a point you know to spend <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about ten minutes</TIMEX> with each <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of them
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so it was an hour you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but whether it was going back and laying in bed with them and just shooting the breeze or whatever telling them stories or reading to them but
 	
 	
 		what was the age difference between the oldest and youngest
 	
 	
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six years</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		so they were all real close that's tough that's a lot of time
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh yeah we look back and wonder how we did it
 	
 	
 		did you both work your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> too or
 	
 	
 		no she never did
 	
 	
 		uh well qualify that she worked at home i'm sure
 	
 	
 		and
 		well yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		but that's uh well both my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> and i work and sometimes i feel like you know by the time i pick them up and get them <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> and get them fed i have very little time <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">each evening</TIMEX> maybe <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes max</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well that's plenty though
 	
 	
 		And well he spends a lot of time with them while i'm cooking and then i spend time with them while you know he's doing other stuff and and of course we try to spend a lot of time on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the weekend</TIMEX>
 		you know there's a lot of times my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> may not be as clean as i particularly like it but it's neat it's straight and i can live with it because i do stuff with my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> you know
 	
 	
 		right
 		right well you you know with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> you're not going to have a neat house
 	
 	
 		well i've accepted that too  that's true
 	
 	
 		
 
 		and you know it it's tough to find time especially especially especially with both of them working
 	
 	
 		it is
 		yeah that's true
 	
 	
 		and you just have to set the time and say okay this is gonna be it
 	
 	
 		well that's true and and we do a lot of that on the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekends</TIMEX> you know we try to spend <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturdays</TIMEX> together if my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> golfs you know he'll do it during nap times things like that where they're not really missing the presence you know
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 	
 	
 		and we do a lot of family things together we're we're kind of going the other direction <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this weekend</TIMEX> we're planning a trip just he and i this is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time we've gone anywhere without the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> since she was born <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four and a half years ago</TIMEX> so
 	
 	
 		well that's good too
 		yeah that's good that way too
 	
 	
 		well i decided that you know you need that once in awhile that you you need to plan the quality time and and i do think that if you plan it and spend that and make it quality time you don't have to be there <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty four hours a day</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah well that's what they say it it all it takes is about <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five ten minutes</TIMEX> a day
 	
 	
 		but
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and you know and as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> got older i made them you know help me cut the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">grass</ENAMEX> and kind of made that a project too
 	
 	
 		sure
 		sure
 	
 	
 		or whatever and
 	
 	
 		and they think that's a family activity you know yeah that's great fun
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		and uh well yeah if you
 	
 	
 		my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX>'s like mommy can i help you with the laundry of course you can  absolutely yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah just keep them talking that way
 		but uh another thing we used to do is have  family <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">councils</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every Sunday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		and what would you do what
 	
 	
 		
 
 		discuss everything
 		that didn't agree with them and we'd take turns being president
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and everyone would get one's vote and i always thought we'd get outvoted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but it never worked that way
 	
 	
 		so they would just pick whatever issue kind of was at a head <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that week</TIMEX> and then
 	
 	
 		yeah well and we could bring up and we could bring up stuff too
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and that was always good time <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> we really got to know the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> well
 	
 	
 		hum
 		i imagine and i imagine you still have a very close relationship with them
 	
 	
 		and
 		oh yeah in fact they were all in uh over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the weekend</TIMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Easter</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i
 		oh that's wonderful see i was raised in that type of family where you know you don't disobey me you mind me but if you have a problem with what we did or how we did it you can always come back and talk to me about it yeah
 	
 	
 		well we did too and and i remember the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> saying we had a a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> of hers that used to drive us up a tree
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and she said hey i don't make fun fun of your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> so why make fun of mine
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		kind of run kind of hit us between the eyes
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah you don't think of it that way do you
 	
 	
 		no but that that was always good quality time for us
 	
 	
 		now that's good i like that idea
 	
 	
 		and they never had to attend but if if they missed it they had to abide by the rules
 	
 	
 		whatever was voted on huh
 	
 	
 		yeah and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> they'd they'd show up
 	
 	
 		well i think that's great
 	
 	
 		and we'd usually take notes and you know the younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		or maybe all of them needed help at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time or another
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		but they were usually tougher on themselves than they were on us and they loved it
 	
 	
 		
  
 		i i think that's true i can remember times my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> would say well what do you think would be a fair punishment
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and we would always come up with something that was harder than what they would have done you know so i do think it's right that they're harder on themselves you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		but uh boy i i feel for you and your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> well yeah my my uh
 	
 	
 		oh why is that
 	
 	
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of my uh
