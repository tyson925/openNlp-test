 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		why don't you go ahead with the fishing part
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well uh i mostly do i <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> for uh bass
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		down here and uh i  don't get to do as much as i'd like to but uh i i really enjoy i don't like fishing on big lakes but uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		sure
 	
 	
 		on the small ponds where you can pretty much cover the whole pond in an <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> or something
 	
 	
 		sure for the different areas yeah
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		yeah and basically big lake small lake it doesn't matter to me
 		um preference wise to fish for the best if you're going to eat what you are going to catch is pan fish um i've caught you know are northern and
 		and pipes and
 		uh northern pipes and other walleyes and things like that and preferably to me the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meat</ENAMEX> isn't that great
 		i'd rather have the blue gills the sunnies the crappies the perch
 		um to me they're better tasting so i always seem to go fishing for the smaller um
 		smaller fish versus the big fish
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but um when i was growing up my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> kind of introduced me to fly fishing
 		and that was kind of a very interesting uh experience that i had and i'm sure that part of me would like to go back and do that it's kind of like for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">trout</ENAMEX> fishing
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i'm sure someday i'll probably get back but uh at the current time
 		the most
 		if i go fishing it's basically with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worm</ENAMEX> at the end of the hook and i you know try to catch the small fish it's it's not for the big try to try to get the biggie so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		i use a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fly</ENAMEX>  quite a bit uh when i go bass fishing
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		when they're hitting on the top of the water i i really like enjoy i i've never
 	
 	
 		sure
 		it's kind of fun i i mean it's a continual movement and versus uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh when you put that uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worm</ENAMEX> at the end of the hook you sit there and you wait and you wait and then you may move it a little bit just to say that hey you know there's something there but uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh with fly fishing you're constantly uh moving that uh you know your line and you're continually keeping it up and keeping it back down so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and there's a skill in getting it to right where you want it
 	
 	
 		exactly exactly
 	
 	
 		so i really enjoy that
 	
 	
 		it takes a lot of patience and a lot of time to learn how to do it so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um but uh with my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> uh  when we do got fishing uh my my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX>'s real small and she has not experienced fishing yet so i'd rather
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know get her into fishing with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worm</ENAMEX> at the end of the hook and hopefully catch some uh fish so
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 		i had a chance to go to uh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alaska</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six weeks last summer</TIMEX> and did some salmon fishing up there and that was really uh
 	
 	
 		oh gosh yeah
 		oh what an experience huh
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah that was and and it was
 	
 	
 		now that i wouldn't probably i i'm sure that they probably were very delicious tasty
 	
 	
 		oh yes um we we uh i think the best way i had it prepared was smoked
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh it was really good really good
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		but they have
 	
 	
 		and it seems like
 	
 	
 		quite a few different varieties and uh
 		um some are some are better than others
 	
 	
 		sure in the  in the salmon
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		well i've also noticed i don't know the best time of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> for fishing uh in this area is right after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the winter</TIMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> is been on and it's real cold water
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but it seems like if you go fishing like in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the middle of the summer</TIMEX> when it's hot and humid uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> tastes  tastes fishy
 		versus um when the water it's just opened up from the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> temperature is extremely cold
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it's almost the better tasting <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> are either <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> fishing uh when you go ice fishing or
 		when uh you know you go right towards <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early spring</TIMEX> part uh before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> hits because after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> whether the ponds here aren't that deep or the water just changes and it gets busier and more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are out on the lakes
 		and less maybe water like in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the spring</TIMEX> we have lots of rain coming in
 		um there's a big difference in you know fishing too
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		which brings up another point point too as far as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> fishing that's uh way up here in the north here
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that's uh that's a big thing too and i haven't done that in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a long time</TIMEX> but that's enjoyable if you have the right setting and you have a little <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX> to sit in there and uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		a little heater then it's then it's it's good but uh if you have to sit out there in the blowing winds it's not so great on a lake
 	
 	
 		yeah i bet
 	
 	
 		but anyway it was really good talking to you and uh
 		have fun fishing
 	
 	
 		yeah i i didn't know uh i didn't know i thought they were only recording male voices they must have changed that
 	
 	
 		you know this is kind of funny um i've had nothing but male <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">callers</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um every time that i've placed a call it's been with a male and i'm not quite sure if they're taking uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i think what they're trying to do is get a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> together  i was chosen the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time i went through in
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		hum
