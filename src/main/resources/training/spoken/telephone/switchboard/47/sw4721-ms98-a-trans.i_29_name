 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you wanna go first
 	
 	
 		well uh
 		no i don't i don't get as much exercise as i as i should as or or as i would like to uh
 		um these days i'd seems to be to easy to get busy with other things uh i have
 		in the past uh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">jogged</ENAMEX> and and run and every <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every January</TIMEX> and every <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September</TIMEX> i start out again and then it tapers off
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh what about you
 	
 	
 		well yeah i do a lot of exercise right now i'm into jazzercise which i absolutely love um i started <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about two years ago</TIMEX> because i gained some weight over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past few years</TIMEX> and i wanted to get it back off
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i was going through a divorce and i just found that running really made me feel good got out a lot of aggression i went to the gym <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX> and i ran on the treadmill and rode the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bike</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um i felt really good i needed to do it and it was really helpful at the time <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">now</TIMEX> when i do those things they are boring i would rather be outside than in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">gym</ENAMEX> doing this in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> place
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and so i just recently discovered jazzercise <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about two months</TIMEX> ago
 		and i'm getting to be a good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dancer</ENAMEX> from it and i'm just feeling really good i love the class it's real challenging
 		so i'm really into that i really like that a lot and it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well now that's that's it it that's related to the the aerobic uh society
 	
 	
 		it is it's aerobics but it's with dance steps it's an aerobic exercise and it's <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an hour straight</TIMEX> and it's just um it's a lot of fun i feel like i'm not just exercising
 	
 	
 		okay
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		because i'm dancing and i'm  i'm getting much better my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stamina</ENAMEX>'s getting great for the dance floor  so i mean it's just there's a lot of positive things with it so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well uh okay now that's inside again right
 	
 	
 		it is inside and i've been doing a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bike</ENAMEX> riding outside with the nice weather we've been having and i enjoy that much more too than inside
 	
 	
 		but it
 		do do you like to do it with with other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> i mean like the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the jazzercise</TIMEX> would be
 	
 	
 		i have a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirteen year old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> and so we go bike riding and it's nice we get to spend some time together rather than i go to the gym while she does her homework so i've enjoyed that part of it yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and at the gym even in the class uh i we do we it's not really a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> where you chat a lot everybody's on their way to someplace
 	
 	
 		right but
 	
 	
 		and so you know i do have one <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> that goes occasionally but basically i do it by myself in a group of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">maybe forty</NUMEX>  so
 	
 	
 		yeah right right but still there are other there are other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> there doing the doing the same thing in that in terms of motivation and incentive yeah
 	
 	
 		there are there are it's more motivating that way i think yeah yeah you could get a tape probably and do it at home in front of the TV but you you probably wouldn't
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah uh that makes a difference doesn't i i've one thing more when i have
 	
 	
 		so
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		run and jogged uh
 		i've always enjoyed doing it by myself and and no no not with the sense that was a a chore or something that i was having to do i i've really enjoyed just the activity and and uh
 		i
 		write software uh as far as the job and so getting getting out and being active
 		uh
 		is uh
 		uh helps out the the it's a change the change the change of pace and just getting out and around and and i find that i can often you know often uh when i get around to doing it then i i feel better when i get back to work and the and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i can see it'll be a good break right
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh
 		also that that
 		it my subconscious is working on things while i'm working and i i go back and i've got new ideas but but still
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i think you do you feel very good after you exercise i think it's worth making the time for yourself you owe it to yourself and i think you do accomplish more after that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i think that it's just is good for your self esteem for everything because when you look better you feel better
 		and it's just uh i think it's well worth it i just demand that time for myself now i've learned to do that and it you know and it i think it just benefits you all around
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		yeah i think that's uh i i think that's a good term demanding demanding the time for yourself but you you've just got to you've just got to prioritize right
 	
 	
 		you have to because there's always more things to do there is always things that you can make priority to it but i just i don't demand a lot for myself and so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know i just feel entitled to it and i take it
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well good well good well uh
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		uh have you have you done any jogging i tell you said you you did on the on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bike</ENAMEX> and on the treadmill in the in the uh clubs
 	
 	
 		no i've done some walking with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> in the past but i find that when you do that you do more chatting than you do exercise and that's not really beneficial
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so uh
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		i don't have time like that and i spend enough time chatting around everywhere you know and the phone
