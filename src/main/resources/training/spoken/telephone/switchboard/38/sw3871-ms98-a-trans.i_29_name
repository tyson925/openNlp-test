 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well what do you think about recycling
 	
 	
 		well it's uh certainly would would help things out uh i don't see a terribly lot of it going on uh here
 	
 	
 		i don't see a lot of it here either
 	
 	
 		i was actually quite surprised i went to uh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> recently uh to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berkeley</ENAMEX> and and uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		they actually have mandatory recycling well no theirs theirs is not mandatory i'm sorry uh but you know it was just incredible to see  everybody with you know with with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> bags of things and they they have a community recycling <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> uh where
 		rather than than having monetary incentives for the the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that actually bring stuff into recycling they're just doing it to help out the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> and then the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> can use that money you know any money that they can get from that goods that are recycled
 	
 	
 		well i think if they had some place up up in your area like i know they don't here
 	
 	
 		yeah no i would i would be glad to but you know we have no place convenient at all i mean i am not really concerned about making money off it um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know i mean that that the amount of money that would come out of it is not really enough to make it worthwhile
 	
 	
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		it's just the recycling per se uh we do very little uh recycle <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX>  but other than that
 		kind of a shame
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		we we do our cans and stuff but um
 		um you know i don't know if there is someplace close by where you could take everything i know in our neighborhood every so often <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every few months</TIMEX> they'll put in our subdivision they'll put out um
 		like dump <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trucks</ENAMEX> so you can get rid of your trash and garbage in your <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">yard</ENAMEX> and they'll haul it off for you and it is all free if they did something like that and they they'll get a chipper you know like in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the spring</TIMEX> and in the fall
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		right
 	
 	
 		if they did the same thing for recycling i think that would go over real well
 	
 	
 		yeah i i i think you know i think that if they would have sort of neighborhood or or semi neighborhood recycling <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> that is what i saw in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berkeley</ENAMEX> was it was real interesting it just had uh bunches of bins and and uh
 		in different in each for different thing uh uh you know they even had a specific specific of course being in wine <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> they they even had wine bottle recycling so you take the wine bottles and the the the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wineries</ENAMEX> would actually buy you know take those bottles back directly
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		wow
 		and recycle them
 	
 	
 		yeah not and not to have to melt them down they just reuse them uh but they had things for for different types of paper and they had things for the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aluminum</ENAMEX> and then for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plastics</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		were they all over the community
 	
 	
 		apparently yeah there there you know there is only a matter of maybe <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten fifteen</NUMEX> blocks away from where these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> of my lived and and they just save everything up and took a trip over there and they they didn't get anything for it but but um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know the thing is that a center like that i am sure it would be self supporting if uh you know just off the proceeds from from recycled things
 	
 	
 		well it couldn't like glass <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> buy the glass back from uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> or something like that
 	
 	
 		yeah that's what i am saying you know they could pay for it you know if they have to have someone there occasionally to kind of keep an eye on things or do stuff
 		you know that that salary could easily be paid out of the money that comes from uh selling <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glass</ENAMEX> or or aluminum or whatever
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and uh you know they even had uh they even had a little little shelf area for recycled books where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> brought books they didn't want put them on the shelf and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> just come and take anything you wanted off the shelf and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well i'll be
 	
 	
 		it was uh quite quite an operation
 	
 	
 		well that's pretty neat maybe it'll catch on all over but i haven't really seen it around here hardly at all
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		no no i
 	
 	
 		um i have seen where one um i think trash <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> will put out you put out a bin but it it was never explained what you put in it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know and do they really you know i haven't seen a special kind of a truck oh in this area now i've seen them uh around <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Austin</ENAMEX> uh some they're they're like <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> division <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trucks</ENAMEX> you know it has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> compartments
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh oh i haven't seen those now i i i think i have seen them actually going with like a sack on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">side</ENAMEX> where they are picking up <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aluminum</ENAMEX> cans <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> put them out separately
 		and they'll they'll toss those in a in a bag on the side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">truck</ENAMEX> or something but
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		hm yeah i i i think that there is a little bit of you know of of you know i think that they the emphasis on making money from recycling
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		is is a is a little bit wrong certainly there is money and value to somebody but i think that the average consumer probably doesn't want to spend the time and it is not enough money to make it really interesting anyway and so
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		um you know i think they they ought to make more of an emphasis on on convenience as opposed to to uh you know to trying to give <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> money for it
 	
 	
 		yeah i know i know if they did something like that at work you know if they separated paper where i work they don't even separate the paper
 	
 	
 		oh now that we do we where i work we we recycle the cans and bottles and and paper but there's a lot of computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> generated so it's you know generally clean white paper
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		now see they don't even do it where i work for a private <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX> and you know that uh ordinary office paper which they go through a lot of it and they they shred all of it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		oh
 	
 	
 		you know and i would think you know and i see them carry them out
