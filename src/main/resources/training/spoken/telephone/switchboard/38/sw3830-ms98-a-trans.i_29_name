 		yeah because i i work for myself and so uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh there's a lot that i that i guess i do miss uh a lot  of benefits from working for a big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">corporation</ENAMEX> i miss uh insurance and uh the steady paychecks that come but uh
 	
 	
 		yes right
 		yes
 		yes i've been in my own business <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Kay</ENAMEX> in fact i'm selling it out now to go to school for a turn and i enjoyed the freedom of having
 	
 	
 		oh is that right
 	
 	
 		that you know go to work when i wanted to and not but you know the benefits weren't there so
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah i uh  i own part of a roofing company
 	
 	
 		oh do you yeah
 	
 	
 		in the in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas Fort Worth</ENAMEX> area
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh you you know unfortunately we we were part of a of a bigger bigger <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> and they uh you know we  we had all the benefits there and and i do miss that you know but uh on the other hand i
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i uh
 		i enjoy having the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the time</TIMEX> that i have with my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		right
 		yep um-hum
 	
 	
 		being able to you know work when i want and
 	
 	
 		i think <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> the thing that i uh
 		would appreciate the most uh because my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> gets his medical through his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> but we have to pay for mine
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and we're the only one that i'm the only one that's being insured
 	
 	
 		oh is that right
 	
 	
 		and and we pay the same amount that someone over there that has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> have i mean so it's kind of and i would i really and the way medical expenses are
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		it's a
 	
 	
 		i think that's probably one of the biggest benefits to have you need to have
 	
 	
 		yeah it really probably it yeah i'll tell you what that is the single most uh benefit that i that i
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		enjoyed and i do miss because i looked into picking up some uh medical insurance for my just for my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> you know just
 		and it is unbelievable how much you have to pay for it
 	
 	
 		it's out of sight right it's out of sight
 	
 	
 		and uh yeah
 	
 	
 		even at a group rate i couldn't believe how much is our
 	
 	
 		oh yeah even at a group rate uh it's it's unbelievable and uh the amount that you have to pay for you know for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> and and if you want to add dental to it i mean that's
 	
 	
 		right it goes up right
 	
 	
 		that eats even more so  yeah i guess what the other benefits that uh
 		that i uh that i miss i guess is uh you know some of the
 		bonuses and stuff that that goes on with just being involved with a big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> you know and course these days you can't count on that because
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh you know i feel bad for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that are involved in that uh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> deal there in in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arlington</ENAMEX> and i'm i'm sure it'll be you know quite a few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are affected by that so
 	
 	
 		right
 		right it's going to hurt the city although uh i will personally tell you i used to work at a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX> and i would see the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> come in when they were they would shut down to retool
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		they were paid that whole time and i don't know if you're aware of this right yes
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		they come in there just they go off fishing and stuff and come in and
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every Friday</TIMEX> and go to the safety deposit box and i'm sitting there making a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">hundred dollars</NUMEX> a week you know and they had all these great i i really believe they have done this to themselves
 	
 	
 		is that right
 	
 	
 		in a way because of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unions</ENAMEX> being so strong
 	
 	
 		the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Union</ENAMEX> yeah
 	
 	
 		and right now anybody that's laid off from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GM</ENAMEX> will have <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a full year</TIMEX>'s paycheck
 		i just read this in the paper <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the other day</TIMEX> plus probably <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">an additional six months</TIMEX> through the the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX>'s stuff that they have at
 	
 	
 		is that right
 	
 	
 		at uh through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> so i'm sorry you know i'm sorry it's happening because it's going to hurt but i don't feel as sorry for them if my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> were laid off <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX> we'd get <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> more check and that would be it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well really the
 		yeah really the ones it's gonna hurt is is actually the the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX> around in that area you know that's the ones that that that's going to hurt because they depend on that uh
 	
 	
 		yes oh yeah that's already hurting yeah
 		but i think there's a case where benefits have gotten they voted them in and they got so good i mean like <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">two dollars</NUMEX> for a prescription no deductible on the medical all these things you know
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and it made the prices of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> go up and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and you know the i we i believe in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unions</ENAMEX> but they went too far
 	
 	
 		well i tell you i  i've had my fill of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unions</ENAMEX>  i use
 	
 	
 		i mean i can't make eighteen dollars an hour
 		i mean i know someone out here that makes eighteen dollars an hour
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
