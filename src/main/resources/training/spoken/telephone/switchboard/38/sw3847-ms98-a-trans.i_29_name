 
     		
 	
 		okay i pushed it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		okay
 	
 	
 		so what do you do in your lawn do you do it yourself or do you hire someone to do it
 	
 	
 		uh no we've been doing it ourselves for most of the time uh find that it's
 		really a little more economical and we have or i found that i have the time and i kind of enjoyed it over here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> i used to live in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arizona</ENAMEX> and it was very confusing very frustrating because i didn't have the
 		watering system and it was it was just too much work and not enough enjoyment but over here we get enough <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> automatically you know naturally as well have the automatic sprinklers and so it's a lot more rewarding
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah right
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		well we do our own out here of there you know mow it ourselves and everything but um our water supply right now is bad we need rain badly
 	
 	
 		oh  that's right
 	
 	
 		uh we can water here and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patterson</ENAMEX> i can water on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesdays Thursdays</TIMEX>
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday four days</TIMEX> a week
 	
 	
 		um-hum is is that enough during the hotter times of the year
 	
 	
 		so
 		it was this <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last summer</TIMEX> yeah
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> now if it we don't get some rain they might limit it to not even <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> times you know
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		but um yeah we do our lawn our you know mowing ourselves and everything and i
 		do our planting of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">bulbs</ENAMEX> and things for i can have some spring <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah i i find that i've been doing a lot of perennial planting which i never did before and
 	
 	
 		
  
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and it's been real enjoyable although i didn't do any this <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last fall</TIMEX> because our past <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winters</TIMEX> have been so cold um they'd freeze down and by the time they the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> would
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		come back to life it was supposedly the time to pull things out for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the spring</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> planting
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so i was getting kind of disillusioned and tired and and spending too much money on something that was kind of uh more of a problem than it was rewarding so
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um i'm gonna try to wait <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">now</TIMEX> and just do <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the spring</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> type plantings and see how that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah we have quite a few roses i just uh we in fact we just pruned them uh way down and i uh just uh uh had to replace on of them so i just bought that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> and uh probably go outside <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> that
 	
 	
 		you know feels
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but um i like to have the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">roses</ENAMEX> where i can have cut <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all year long</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah those are enjoyable
 	
 	
 		i even had uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">roses</ENAMEX> on my table for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> dinner
 	
 	
 		oh did you
 	
 	
 		which was really pretty you know  but um other than the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">roses</ENAMEX> i don't have too many <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers i plant</ENAMEX> gladiolas
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 		um those are nice
 	
 	
 		and those are always pretty but they get so tall and they they bend over so fast
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i haven't done much in in <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">bulbs</ENAMEX> in fact i received as a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> present a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a</TIMEX>
 		a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planter</ENAMEX> that had bulbs in it that we were supposed to go ahead and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> at any time and
 		and after it started to sprout put in sunny window and it's it just grew like crazy but i don't have any <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> on it i don't know how long that takes or if there's anything i need to differently but
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		hum
 	
 	
 		it's just nice and green right now
 	
 	
 		um-hum well is it that one of those Amaryllis

 		no huh
 		oh okay
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh so i don't know
 	
 	
 		do you have a big yard
 	
 	
 		no not really and in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Plano</ENAMEX> and most of the newer areas of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> uh they have just the the minimum square footage for <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lots</ENAMEX> to where you get a little bit of a backyard we have a pool in our backyard and we did plan it to where we have
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		some some play yard last over but it's
 		it's um you know very small but most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> here if you have a pool you don't have anything else in the backyard that's that's about the size of most of them
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah right right
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
