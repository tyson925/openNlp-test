 		that uh she's going to move you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		yeah and um  by the way my other big pet here said he's gonna call you tonight  and
 	
 	
 		okay  well i've had some really interesting things happening with my <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> let me tell you about this
 	
 	
 		you have
 	
 	
 		i have a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> that at nighttime when it wants to go in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garage</ENAMEX> because he's kind of spoiled he will bark
 		and i have a neighbor next door who gets real mad at this so
 		for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last three weeks</TIMEX> he's turned us into the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> and in to the uh the animal control and every time they come over of course he's very well behaved and he doesn't bark or anything and so
 	
 	
 		oh you're kidding
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it's just really gotten out of hand i mean he has called and threatened my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> and to come over and kill the dog it's going it's just berserk
 	
 	
 		oh
 		he doesn't have any <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pets</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		he does  he has a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> himself out in the backyard that barks but for some reason this <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX>'s bark just drives him up a wall and he's just
 	
 	
 		um
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i don't know it's been really upsetting he keeps calling and
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		you know it bothers me when the dog <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">barks</ENAMEX> so as soon as he barks we put him in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garage</ENAMEX> but
 	
 	
 		um
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i don't know what the problem is
 	
 	
 		oh for crying out loud well
 	
 	
 		he is an alcoholic so i think he's just found something to vent his anger on and it's he's decided that it's us but
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		um-hum um-hum well we don't have that problem <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lady</ENAMEX> hardly ever barks at all unless she's outside playing and uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chasta</ENAMEX> only barks like when the paper boy delivers the mail she might bark for a little bit
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		see that's like this dog it only barks i mean the longest it ever barks is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">ten minutes</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		hm
 	
 	
 		but you know he's called over and said he's going to get the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> to take <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> away and that we're <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">idiots</ENAMEX> for having a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> like that and
 	
 	
 		i'll be
 		oh that's too bad
 	
 	
 		it's just really been upsetting because they were real good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> up until <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		this time
 	
 	
 		yeah that would that would really be upsetting with me too if my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> didn't like my <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh well of course <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> have dogs you know and they get to come over and play
 	
 	
 		well see everybody everybody all the way up has a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> that's what's so strange  every <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> all you know all the way up from on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> you know <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> up from me and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> down have dogs
 	
 	
 		um-hum hum
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		um-hum um-hum  well some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have dogs but they really don't like them i don't know why they even keep them
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know really some a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pets</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		yeah i figure why have them if you're not gonna take real good care of them
 	
 	
 		oh yeah God <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mine</ENAMEX> are like my family
 	
 	
 		but
 	
 	
 		at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> they sit out here by the door by the patio door and look in you know sit side by side
 	
 	
 		yep that's how this one is
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so every <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> i think for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two hours every night</TIMEX> and then we let them in
 		and they come in they just lay down but just i guess just the idea that they're in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> with us for a while you know
 	
 	
 		huh
 		yeah feel loved huh  huh  well i haven't i don't know what i you know i can't figure out how to solve the problem unless i get rid of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kahuna</ENAMEX> and uh you know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh</ENAMEX>  so
 	
 	
 		i've got to live in this neighborhood so it's almost boiled down to do i
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		do i keep a pet that i love or do i live unhappily in a neighborhood paranoid of whether he's ever gonna bark or not
 	
 	
 		well that's a shame you know and you can i know you can have their barker taken out but who'd want to do that that would be awful
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know
 		well that's too bad
 		but anyhow we don't have that problem like i say
 	
 	
 		well i'm thinking about going back to rabbits they were quiet  mess free
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		well at least you can still get some right
 	
 	
 		yeah we have a ample supply of rabbits
 	
 	
 		well that's good  well let's see
 	
 	
 		boy
 		well this is really a treat
 	
 	
 		isn't it funny though  i just wondered if someday this was going to happen
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah let's hope it happens again
