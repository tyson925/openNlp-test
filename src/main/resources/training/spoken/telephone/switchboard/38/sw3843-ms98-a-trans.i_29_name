 
     		
 	
 		do you think do we spend enough on that or
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh probably not from what i've been hearing i mean there's not enough getting done
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah i just kind of wonder uh you know i've been thinking
 		i don't know how much they spend on <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> and how much they spend on <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> and some of those other things but it seems like uh
 		you know it needs to be somewhat equitable i guess as far as the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that are affected uh <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> seems to affect a lot more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and you'd think they need to spend more on that but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well you think this <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> thing has been around since about <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">nineteen eighty</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i would have thought by now they'd have been a lot more advances
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		in treatment and then again i guess there is i mean there's some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> that they didn't have and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i'm sure that didn't come cheap
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true it's uh i don't know it's kind of interesting issue you wonder
 		now it's gotten so out of hand that you know it's not just that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homosexual population</ENAMEX> and stuff like that uh you know it's affected everybody just even if you go to a hospital it's
 		kind of hard to know what to do and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you really i don't even think they really a decent idea of how many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> really have it i
 	
 	
 		it's pretty uh
 	
 	
 		i would imagine a lot more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have it than they think and
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah i keep thinking that myself
 	
 	
 		it's kind of a scary
 	
 	
 		i i was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> when the war thing was going on and it was over and they said it costed you know like seventy <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">billion</NUMEX> or something
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and they said if they had that much money for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> research they could have found found a cure
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so i kind of wondered about that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		wait whether amongst
 	
 	
 		to me that's an astronomical amount of money  and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah seventy
 	
 	
 		and uh but it suddenly comes from somewhere i don't know where it comes from but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and you just wonder i you know i look at kind of now too where we're getting all this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> asking us for aid outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> you know or to support the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> this that and the other and
 		you know i sometimes wonder if it's not time we started you know maybe turning some of that stuff back towards home and helping some of those problems and you know <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> being one of them to
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i think didn't the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> put i don't know if it was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a billion</NUMEX> or so more dollars or something in the budget this well i guess it was in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ninety one</NUMEX> to try and find a cure for it or
 	
 	
 		there again that doesn't seem like a whole lot of money
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know if to do something like that with
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh but i i kind of agree with you we should spend more in this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> for not only <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> but a lot of other things before we start helping other countries
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah it's kind of kind of ironic ourselves we're on the down trend and here we are trying to still pick other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> up and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		seems like that's all we ever do and it comes back to haunt us in the long run
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but
 	
 	
 		i mean in in in your own financial budget if if you're not doing well you're not going to help out anyone else
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah that's true i mean that you might that you want to try and be charitable but yet you got to take care of your own <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and put your own <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> in order before you start dishing out to everybody else and
 	
 	
 		but but that's not the way this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> is or ever been i think we've always
 	
 	
 		yeah i
 	
 	
 		they had reasons for it i think i heard <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one just the other day</TIMEX> that
 		because of all the money he was you know giving away right now uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> was i think his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> said something with well we've got to keep these <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> in a democratic mode and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh sometimes i don't think it matters
 	
 	
 		no and and
 		yeah i i i agree that just
 		and and like i say what do we really get out of it a lot of times you know i guess if we didn't help the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> there could be just total chaos and go back to the old order but
 		you know we're either paying for it in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX> or we're paying we're giving it to them for nothing you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and then we you know at least we have jobs when we're making all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX> and stuff it seemed like and now we don't even have those because we cut back so much and then we give it away and you just wonder what we really get  out of it
 	
 	
 		my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> and i used to work at a research <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX> for the government
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i know things go slow
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		an incredible amount of money is spent to achieve little or nothing sometimes
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so i understand
 		you know where the money gets ate up at and
 		but there really should just be more
 	
 	
 		more money spent
 	
 	
 		and now that
 		yeah and now that they're you know the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapon</ENAMEX> spending is going down
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but we could put some of these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratories</ENAMEX> even like the one we worked at at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los Alamos</ENAMEX> put them onto you know more <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> things
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 		well uh do you know that much about i mean have you ever met anybody that has <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> or
 	
 	
 		not that i know of
 	
 	
 		yeah i've never met anybody myself but
 	
 	
 		i think that where we used to live we had a neighbor down the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> and i heard a rumor that one of them died with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but i never knew for sure i met them once or twice because they used to sell <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> in the yard but
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i never really considered that i knew them so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		just more passing but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah i just i haven't had anything strike home so it really hasn't hit me as bad as some you know you tend to sometimes wonder well hey you know you kind of brought it on yourself but like i say now it's getting so much more in
 		into society that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that you know have no intention of doing anything you know kind of end up with it and
 		you know little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> and stuff like that that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that is it's and i say i don't have any idea how much and there ought to be probably a lot more spent to
 		to find out i just i just hope they kind of keep things in perspective and remember there's a bunch of other
 		you know type diseases out there it seems you hear a lot more about the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activists</ENAMEX> than you do these other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with these other <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		actually
