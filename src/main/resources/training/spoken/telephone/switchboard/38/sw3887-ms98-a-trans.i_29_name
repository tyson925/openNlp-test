 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well i guess we're uh
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		forced to finally to do a lot about air pollution i hear that
 		the major <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">automobile</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturers</ENAMEX> are looking at nonpolluting <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> and low polluting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fuels fuels</ENAMEX> are being experimented with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX> and
 		other types of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fuels</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah one of the things they asked me to ask you was where you thought the major source was coming from
 	
 	
 		i you know i assume that the major sources are <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factories</ENAMEX> but i
 	
 	
 		or sources
 		that's what i would think
 	
 	
 		i don't know for sure i just know that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">um acid rain</ENAMEX> apparently is a big problem in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> from what comes over the border from us
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah i think the automobile definitely is an area
 		uh any any industry that burns you know
 		and then i don't know about chemical pollution i'm not real
 		into that as far as how it affects the air i know we have a lot of chemical the indoor type pollution they have <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> that are too well insulated they found <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are getting sick
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but i don't know if that affects outside
 		you know i i think seems to think seems to me that's what they were asking about was outside and the thing i can the only thing i can think of would be <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factories</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah the smokestacks or the exhaust pipes um i guess there's been a lot of pressure to um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		do away with the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CFCs</ENAMEX> in these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spray</ENAMEX> bottles which has been a real problem
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah that is well that's destroying the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ozone</ENAMEX> isn't it yeah
 	
 	
 		again i that's what i hear and and there's this big debate apparently about whether the ozone there's a hole in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ozone</ENAMEX> or not but at last i heard it was
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">uh</ENAMEX> discovered that the hole was bigger than they thought initially
 	
 	
 		yeah that's it it's kind of scary
 	
 	
 		well it is scary and i think it will uh
 		continue to force us to clean up our act literally and figuratively
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		we've got to learn to manage without destroying the environment
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i think something too that you probably see in older states all we we do it down here once in a while we will have a cold spell is where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> will use their fireplaces
 	
 	
 		i i i'm wondering whether it's going to get to the point where you can't do that  in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> they're apparently going to they've passed laws that for habit for example <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> using
 	
 	
 		i think it will
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">barbecues</ENAMEX> gasoline lawn mowers
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">um</ENAMEX> and it's really bad in places like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> and it's gotten bad in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Denver</ENAMEX> and and uh it's not too bad around here although you see it you know more and more in the sky
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> are really wedded to their uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> and our economy seems to and this i think is one of the big problems
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah in this area too since you know in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> we're so spread out we have to drive so far but i know in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colorado</ENAMEX> i have witnessed that where it just uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it just stacks up at the when the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rockies</ENAMEX> starts but we're even getting it here we can drive into when we've been on vacation or something drive into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fort Worth</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX>
 		and you can tell it in the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">mornings</TIMEX> too my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> likes to go out and jog and there's just a brown fog here and we don't even have any mountains that are holding it in
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but they also said that more dense the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> and the more we <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX> together the worse it gets
 	
 	
 		well that makes a lot of sense i mean i i hadn't thought about it that way but it it
 	
 	
 		you don't have to have mountains there stopping it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh they make uh making more and more high-rise <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> and uh
 		so yeah we can comment and we didn't see this <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few years ago</TIMEX> it was pretty clear here
 	
 	
 		no and i think yeah and i think that that more and more it's becoming apparent to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that the earth
 		which includes all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> on it and everything that's going on it is a is an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> of sorts and that there is a  a whole
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		set of organic relationships that if we start to destroy <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> part of it it's going to tell us about it and uh we're going to feel it and i think it's going to be real interesting and particularly in light of what is obviously going to be a
 		big structural change in the economy
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh in this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> uh whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are willing to get out of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> and in in this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> uh the the solution that that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> seem to think work are politically unacceptable for example taxing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> heavily for using their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh i'm i have a little sports <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> that i enjoy using and i know just like anybody else how much fun it is to drive but
 		i think uh we're gonna have to make some fundamental changes and and i'm i'm not sure
 		how long it's gonna take or what it's gonna take because they keep saying that the economy
 		is gonna depend on how many <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> we sell
 	
 	
 		yes and it's a shame too when you do see somebody driving a big <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> in that it's a lot of waste but
