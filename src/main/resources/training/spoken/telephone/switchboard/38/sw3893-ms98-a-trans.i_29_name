 
     		
 	
 		okay  so have you had a project recently
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well as about as a matter of fact <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about two years ago</TIMEX> right now uh i've completely and totally remodeled and restored my kitchen
 	
 	
 		that's a project
 	
 	
 		yeah i uh i tore out the uh walls all the way down to the studs and started over we had had a uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen</ENAMEX> we've we had was um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		had a paneling in it dark paneling and and the cabinets were sort of old and it was just dark in here and old cabinets and uh counter tops
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		at first i was we were just gonna paint the thing and you know how everything just sort of grows
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		and uh so i ended up just just tearing tearing out the whole place and uh putting sheet <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rock</ENAMEX> in and building my own cabinets with ceramic tile on the counter tops and just everything  new floor
 	
 	
 		you must you must be pretty handy
 	
 	
 		well uh i'm fairly good at it not not not enough to be professional or anything but i can do my own
 	
 	
 		so you did the tile counter tops how do you like that
 	
 	
 		yeah um-hum
 		i love that it's it's really pretty we had just uh Formica
 		and when i built the new cabinets uh i looked into this tile deal and i thought well you know i think we can probably do this
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and um it was uh
 		it was not even not hard at all um it just i just followed the instructions the basic instructions that you use with the tile and uh they're not hard at all really it's just about anybody can do that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		did you have or do you have any problem with staining of the grout
 	
 	
 		no not at all um uh what we what i've been doing is just using some like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bleach</ENAMEX> and it uh gets it clean but it does it has browned over the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the couple of years</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know but it really don't look that bad even though it has gotten brown you know what i should have done now that i think about it was used brown colored grout
 	
 	
 		and just start out with that and uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and
 		that's right that's right
 		you know because it does stain some i mean you could whiten it but i never have
 	
 	
 		well how long did it take you to complete this
 	
 	
 		um <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about three months</TIMEX> probably <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three or four months</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		that's not bad considering you did it yourself although i'm sure it was a real pain to have to live you know with everything
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		well it was for a while the worst part about it was we had to do it when i got to the sink part over here what i did was i left this cabinet
 		just about this one wall where the sink is to the very last
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and um i figured well you know i'll remodel the rest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen</ENAMEX> and then when we get to that point i'll do that last because we so we can keep the sink as long as possible
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and then we had we were without a sink <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about a week or a week</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a half or so</TIMEX>
 		and um what we had to do was just take the dishes and uh put them in a big dish pan
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and you get <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> from the bath tub and then rinse them in you know for with the bath <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> not not in the tub  but you're just letting it run under there you know
 	
 	
 		no i know what you mean  sounds to me like the perfect excuse that your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> didn't cook for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about three months</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		real really  yeah we did eat out a lot
 	
 	
 		did you have any major catastrophes or anything
 	
 	
 		not a thing not a thing i almost thought i had cut through a water <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pipe</ENAMEX> in the wall but i didn't i just nicked it a little bit it wasn't all the way through  and now that was about it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 		well that's quite an undertaking uh you know
 	
 	
 		yeah  well have you have you done anything like that or or anything smaller or
 	
 	
 		well nothing that big a deal my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> did um he made a cedar <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">closet</ENAMEX> and shelving out in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garage</ENAMEX> uh for us which really was nice um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i don't know how it is in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biloxi we Dallas</ENAMEX> has no <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">basements</ENAMEX> i suspect <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Biloxi</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh no no there's nothing like that here either
 	
 	
 		yeah well we come from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Midwest</ENAMEX> where there's <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">basements</ENAMEX> and you know so you have to make storage where you can
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh he bought the sheeting uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">cedar sheeting</ENAMEX> and put that in and i didn't know for certain how that would you know how that would work out if it would be tight enough to keep the bugs and all out but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		sure
 	
 	
 		it's been great we haven't had any problems with moths or anything and the extra he finished the outside painted it to match the uh <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garage</ENAMEX> walls which is white and it's just beautiful it really added a whole lot you know storagewise to the house
 	
 	
 		right right
 		oh sure yeah it does
 	
 	
 		but uh i think the only glitches he ran into on that i put a few nails in it so i consider myself a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> in this  but
 	
 	
 		that's right you are
 		and you're and you're <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> and half
 	
 	
 		yeah right the only thing we had to do is down at the bottom of the doors he had to put in oh like some extra closure because even though he thought that the um the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plywood</ENAMEX> that he got was straight
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		somehow the humidity or something warped it a little bit while he was building it and we have to have a little closing you know to hold it down at the bottom
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh i understand yeah a little latch like yeah right
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		but that that was about it but our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">only four years old</TIMEX> so we haven't done you know just a whole lot to it at this point
 	
 	
 		well yeah yeah everything is still so brand new yeah
 	
 	
 		um-hum although we're talking about adding uh the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">the</NUMEX> ceilings here are high and the pitch of the uh roofs are very high and we're talking about adding like some <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> up in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">attic</ENAMEX> space
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		oh i see
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> because there is so much space up there
 	
 	
 		well yeah sure
 	
 	
 		but uh i don't know that that's something we will undertake ourselves part of it we'll probably do you know like hanging the
 	
 	
 		no yeah now something like that i would probably have hire have to hire
