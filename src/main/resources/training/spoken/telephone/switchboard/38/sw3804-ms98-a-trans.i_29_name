 		yeah it's making me hungry for them  right now
 	
 	
 		yeah you know i've made like little <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Swedish</ENAMEX> meatballs but they're just made out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beef</ENAMEX> you know
 	
 	
 		have you yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spices</ENAMEX> and things in them but never anything mixed with Bisquick
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		i i've used that quite a bit and it and it seems to work real well um and uh um
 	
 	
 		um-hum hm
 	
 	
 		when i've had so many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> uh to to feed like i'd try to do a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ham</ENAMEX>
 		an a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">turkey</ENAMEX> and and
 	
 	
 		yeah that's my that's my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> mostly is at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas time</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thanksgiving</TIMEX> time
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know i've uh i had an open house <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> here once when after we moved in here
 		uh which i had uh things like that but i always cooked them ahead of time and then i just sliced them
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know and had <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">macaroni salad</ENAMEX> with uh shrimp in it have you ever had that
 	
 	
 		no what
 	
 	
 		get some fresh little fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">shrimp</ENAMEX> and it's in your <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">macaroni salad</ENAMEX> that you make
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		the shrimp just gives it a really good flavor
 	
 	
 		oh i'll bet
 	
 	
 		yeah i don't like the can but the fresh you know
 	
 	
 		yeah i'll have to try that
 	
 	
 		yeah that was really good
 	
 	
 		i like things that are easy and and uh
 		nutritious
 	
 	
 		yeah right right  but uh at uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> time we just have a regular sit down dinner you know
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		which is kind of hard because you got so many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and then by time you pass everything around it seems like everything on your plate's cold
 	
 	
 		i know i know  well thank God for microwaves you know
 	
 	
 		so but anyhow i
 		yeah you can always take your plate and just heat it up you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh other than that i i don't have too too many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> uh you know i have like maybe just <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a couple another couple</NUMEX> over for dinner
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but uh other than than than that i don't have you know a whole bunch of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> like except except at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> and i have my family
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right well i don't anymore yeah it's been <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few years</TIMEX> and and uh
 		i don't have you know over a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> either and and uh  i try to
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh have everything all ready and and it it just makes it a lot nicer where i don't spend spend all my time in the kitchen
 	
 	
 		yeah right right
 	
 	
 		and uh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spaghetti</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		yeah that's easy i always like to have that too you know everybody seems to like that too
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i know i don't think i've ever met anyone that didn't
 	
 	
 		no everybody likes that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and then uh if you have a nice big roast that you can throw in the oven then you can put your <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">potatoes</ENAMEX> and carrots or whatever else all in there you know especially if a pork roast that's what i love
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		i like it too
 	
 	
 		with my
 		and um  other than that in fact i'm just thinking of what goes next <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekend</TIMEX> when the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Super Bowl</ENAMEX>'s on
 	
 	
 		i do too
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i've asked <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a couple</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to come over and i just uh had been thinking what to have for that
 	
 	
 		yeah well have you had any good ideas yet oh okay
 	
 	
 		no not yet  no and i you know i don't want to have to come away from the TV i want something that i can just take them and serve them while they're sitting in front of the TV
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know so i'll think of something just that that we can munch on over there you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and they can just fill fill their plate up at intermission and then go back over there and sit down
 	
 	
 		and that's the way to do it too
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		i think it's you know what's i think is so nice is that
 		in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this day</TIMEX> and time that we can have good food
 		that's good for you and you don't have to spend <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours and hours and hours</TIMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen</ENAMEX> and and it makes an awful lot of difference doesn't it
 	
 	
 		yeah preparing it right
 		oh it sure does
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		well when i was brought up you know we didn't
