 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well what hobbies do you have
 	
 	
 		uh i crochet uh in in fact uh that's what i was doing when the phone rang
 	
 	
 		oh you do
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		are you making an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Afghan</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm making a baby <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Afghan</ENAMEX> uh for my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter-in-law</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister-in-law</ENAMEX> who's expecting baby number one at age forty
 	
 	
 		oh how wonderful
 		oh my goodness
 	
 	
 		so  i feel uh i feel like she needs a goody
 	
 	
 		well i have a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister-in-law</ENAMEX> who had a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> at age
 		<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">forty</NUMEX> and i think again at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">forty three</NUMEX> so she's
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but i'm expecting too so on my first
 	
 	
 		oh my
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but um i don't uh the only thing i really have done in the past is um
 		uh cross stitch and needlepoint
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um i had learned to crochet some things you know those little kitchen towels
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		where you cut a towel in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> and you sew the top part on so you can i mean crochet the top part of it so that you can attach it to an oven
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i've done that kind of stuff but i haven't done anything as big as an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Afghan</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		do you do that often
 	
 	
 		no i i really don't uh in fact this is the first thing i've crocheted in in uh some time
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but uh my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandmother</ENAMEX> taught me to crochet when i was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five years old</TIMEX> which is a long long long time ago
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		so but i i don't knit my something goes wrong with my knitting the the gauge doesn't work
 	
 	
 		um-hum  yeah that
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh
 	
 	
 		um i just haven't been
 		oh i think i learned how to do that when i was real young too um one thing i'd kind of like to learn how to do is um quilt
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um i see so many beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">quilts</ENAMEX> and i have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> that that make them but you know there's just seems like there's not that amount of time nowadays
 	
 	
 		hum i know i know
 	
 	
 		you know because i work full-time outside the home
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		right now anyway i hope that'll change after the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> gets here but
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and then you don't have the time because you're tending to the child
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but um it would be fun to learn how to do a few of those things
 	
 	
 		yeah well i'll tell you how i sort of feel about it
 		i i feel like uh of course in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the olden days</TIMEX> it was a matter of necessity
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but it it i feel like now that you ought to do what you really like to do not just because your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX> or your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> or your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> or somebody else is doing it
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">the</ENAMEX> if it's not real recreation
 		it's it's it's not doing you any good
 	
 	
 		yeah i think that's true um like some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> make uh um decorating their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> a hobby
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i have a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> who she and i both got into our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> around the same time and she's real she has a knack for that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know she made her own curtains and and i would love to be able to do all of that but i don't feel that i have quite the knack that she does
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and so uh you know we're thinking of hiring a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">decorator</ENAMEX> and stuff and i sometimes feel like you know that's a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cop</ENAMEX> out but yet
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		if if i i don't want to spend all the time and money and not and then feel like it looks real cheaply done or or you know not be satisfied with it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but um my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> had that same knack you know for decorating and and it probably just comes with with age and with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> of experience you know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		no no it doesn't it you either do it or or you either like it or you don't you either have a knack for it or you don't uh
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		and and and uh again i i feel like that
 		if there's something else that you'd rather do uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have a natural green thumb
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> and uh if that's what you like to do fine but if you don't
 		then uh get a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> job and hire somebody
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		do something that you like to do uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		life is too short uh
 		i enjoy crocheting it it's real recreational recreation for me but
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh and</ENAMEX> and i used to sew a lot but uh and i just don't have the time anymore i just now barely keep up with my mending
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but uh you know uh if you don't like to sew buy it readymade everything is available anymore and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah isn't that true
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		we uh in fact mending it you even kind of has gone by the wayside for some most for many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> if they get a hole in their sark sock
 		they don't darn it they they uh
 	
 	
 		hum-um dump it
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh throw it away and buy a new pair
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but um
 		yeah there's a lot of things that i think that i'd like to do
 		but i don't make the time to do them you know and i keep thinking oh well when this happens then i'll have more time to do it and um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		because i like committing a a great amount of time to something if i'm working on it
