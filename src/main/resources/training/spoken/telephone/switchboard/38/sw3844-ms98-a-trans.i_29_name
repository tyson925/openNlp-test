 
     		
 	
 		all right i guess this is a great time to talk about fitness with everybody and their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">New Year</TIMEX>'s resolutions and going out and getting their recor regular exercise program um do you recor exercise regularly
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		uh
 		uh yes i do uh
 	
 	
 		and tell me about that if you would
 	
 	
 		well unfortunately i have a cholesterol problem and uh i for a long time i did aerobics
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yes
 	
 	
 		but <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of years ago</TIMEX> my uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> says no don't do aerobics any more ride the stationary bicycle so that that's what i do for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> a day i average <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six days</TIMEX> a week
 	
 	
 		
 
 		wow
 		well that's great that's fantastic do you have that set up where you can uh listen to some music or read a book or you just uh go
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh definitely oh definitely uh it's it's boring
 	
 	
 		well good  so you're good you're using it
 		yes  because you don't see a whole lot on a stationary bike
 	
 	
 		no no
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> and i i also belong to uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texas Club</ENAMEX> and uh so <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">some days</TIMEX> i uh i go over there and i work out with the the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Nautilus</ENAMEX> weights
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh
 		okay
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		well uh my goal is uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three days a week</TIMEX> but usually it boils down to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX> a week
 	
 	
 		yes yes
 	
 	
 		uh do you have a regular regimen
 	
 	
 		well you've got me at a disadvantage i do not have a regular regiment i do exercise periodically but it's
 		whenever i have the time i uh i have a problem in that i don't make the time and i i understand the importance of it and in fact when i was in high school and college i was
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		on all sorts of athletic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> and and regular programs but since i've gotten into a new job and into my uh career
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and into a young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> time seems to escape me right now but uh one thing that i really enjoy
 	
 	
 		um
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		is that uh i have <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bicycles</ENAMEX> and i have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> that they like to ride <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bicycles</ENAMEX> with me and we ride as a family
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah oh that's wonderful
 	
 	
 		and you know uh i actually live in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Plano</ENAMEX> but i'm working here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> and they have some excellent bike paths
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		where you can go and ride for miles and miles and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> and not see the same scenery twice which is really fun
 	
 	
 		um
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh one thing that i've been doing also is that
 		mind you it's not regularly but uh i like to go out and go jogging and i do that and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> get on their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bikes</ENAMEX> and uh we we
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		they ride along and i jog along and it's a nice time to spend some some time with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> too so i'm trying to coordinate
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> time in conjunction with my exercise time exercise program and uh we really seem to enjoy that
 	
 	
 		oh yeah that's extremely important
 	
 	
 		and uh there there's a couple of reasons for that is my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> are very sports minded even at their young age and uh one of them 's in <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">soccer</ENAMEX> and the other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> just loves to do it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and so we get out and and do this and it i found out that it's very helpful to them also
 		in my oldest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX>'s soccer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">league</ENAMEX> that uh he doesn't seem to run out of breath as much as the other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> do and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		he can stay in longer
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		and uh so i i don't have a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a regular one</TIMEX> but i i really would
 		like to set my priorities straight i guess and and set aside time to do that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i thought of different things i thought about going at the same time <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX> if i am generally uh getting up and heading off to work around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six or six thirty</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		which means i'd have to get up way <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early in the morning in the wee hours of the morning</TIMEX> to do that and uh i've also tried to set aside time in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the afternoon</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh things generally pop up that precru preclude me from from doing that so i just need to get into a habit
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah there's a a program on in the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoons</TIMEX> on channel <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">four o'clock</TIMEX> do you have a VCR
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		uh yes i do
 	
 	
 		uh you might record it and play it later now it's just uh
 		oh stretch and tone it's not aerobics
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		uh but it's called body electric and it's a a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX> broadcasting from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> and uh it's for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> it comes on uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five days a week</TIMEX> and uh it it it's a really good supplement to your <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bike</ENAMEX> riding
 	
 	
 		well great
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh it helps with flexibility and uh
 		for uh for some of the exercises she uses <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">three pound</NUMEX> weights
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		but uh she's not a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a</NUMEX> a great weight <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> but uh sometimes for the uh upper <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX> and deltoids and
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		uh back muscles she uses these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> pound weights
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well that's that's good that's one thing that i'd
 		and the weights i'd kind of like to get away from because in high school and college i lifted an awful lot of weights and that immediately
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
