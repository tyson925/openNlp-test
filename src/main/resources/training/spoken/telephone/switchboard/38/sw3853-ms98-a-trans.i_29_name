 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i have trouble uh coming up with things that actually i've considered invasion of privacy and perhaps it's because i've become so accustomed to the fact that that's the way technology works
 	
 	
 		life is yeah well you know there's something that um i really find kind of maybe it's not an invasion of privacy but it's kind of annoying
 	
 	
 		
 
 		what's that
 	
 	
 		um you know phone calls uh automated
 	
 	
 		oh gosh yes yes
 	
 	
 		you know i mean i i find that really offencing or offensive
 	
 	
 		i suppose that it's an invasion in that they know where you are and and
 	
 	
 		yeah and they don't stop i mean they you know you call and it
 		
 
 		it could be any time of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> and and what happens is is they'll call especially especially those computer ones
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		they'll call and and they don't you can't get them off the line you'll hang up and you pick it up a minute later and they'll still be on there
 	
 	
 		oh seriously i've never had that experience
 	
 	
 		yes i just had you know that just happened <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple day</TIMEX> of i guess it's kind of fresh in my mind because this happened <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of days</TIMEX> ago
 		i'd picked up the phone and it's you know they started talking giving me all this spiel and then you know you try to hang up because there's there's nobody to talk to there's only just um
 	
 	
 		that seems unusual
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and you hang up and then you pick up to make a phone they're still on there
 	
 	
 		you know that almost seems dangerous because what if you picked up the phone to call <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine one one</NUMEX> or something and you
 	
 	
 		i know i know that is
 	
 	
 		i wonder if that was a problem in their system that doesn't seem like it should work that way
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		but uh as far as privacy uh invasion of privacy i there really you know i guess i'm kind of like you i don't really find it
 	
 	
 		haunting you
 	
 	
 		there isn't a whole lot that i feel like it's a invasion of privacy of privacy um
 	
 	
 		i used to be concerned that everyone no matter what the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">creditor</ENAMEX> always wanted to know your social security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">number</ENAMEX> but then i figured well they're
 	
 	
 		oh i know
 	
 	
 		they all have to link it back to some number that that only you have and so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		everyone in the world that i've you know dealt with on a commercial basis probably has that number and that's just the way it is
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well the
 		i guess you know there's um
 	
 	
 		they have access to all your records
 	
 	
 		i i guess i don't think about that very often because it it has become the norm you know um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		if you wanna use credit you have to pay the price and that's
 	
 	
 		yeah and you they find everything i mean they find out everything about you they want to know your you know  where you live what you do what you know and some of the questions yeah and some of the
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		that's probably why you have gotten those calls because they know that you're one of those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who um are in a
 		i don't know income bracket or something but who has disposable income  that's why they're after you
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yes you know sometimes that does happen you know sometimes they they would you know somebody would call on the phone and and uh you know you think it's just
 		uh regular type questions but really they are kind of prying into your to your life you know you
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		they wanna know uh where you live how long you been living there
 	
 	
 		do you own do you rent
 	
 	
 		do you own do you rent you know what time of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the days</TIMEX> they're usually home what uh you know and sometimes you know you just kind of go through the routine of giving it out and then you think about it afterwards
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		why do they need all that you know
 	
 	
 		yeah i generally don't
 		you know when you buy a new product how the um warranty card always asks your level of income
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		and it usually says optional so i i rarely fill it i i don't think i ever fill it out frankly  but uh they they wanna know they  would like to come back and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		right
 		oh yeah oh yeah
 	
 	
 		see whether or not you're gonna buy another product
 	
 	
 		yep
 	
 	
 		interesting
 	
 	
 		but um
 	
 	
 		that's how marketing works today i think
 	
 	
 		i guess it is i'm i'm in that area so it's uh
 	
 	
 		are you
 	
 	
 		well i'm yeah i'm in sales so i
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you always kind of uh you know it i know that when we when i sell a product to a new customer
 		that's always the first thing that i ask you know is about their credit and you know would they have to fill out a little credit application with with us and and sometimes i feel very uncomfortable in in doing that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		really huh
 	
 	
 		um  you know but i know that in order for our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> to survive we can't you know uh
 	
 	
 		oh yeah you don't wanna take risks
 	
 	
 		don't wanna take the risks so
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um i i suppose some of those uh
 	
 	
 		do you personally look at those credit uh references or is there someone else who does that
 	
 	
 		you know that's that's the funniest thing is be rare i mean maybe one out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX>
 		do we check on it yeah you know but it's kind of a routine type thing where you just do it and and you file it away and uh
 	
 	
 		someone else in your <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> does that
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know at random we'll we'll go ahead and check on it but um it's not
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		oh really so there isn't someone who every time does it just not you
 	
 	
 		no huh-uh
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		so you know i just gather the information and and somebody else uh you know at their leisure time uh will check on those credit references but
 	
 	
 		but most of them are checked on routinely just by someone else
 	
 	
 		yeah most of them are yeah most of them are but they're not all you know they're not all done at the same time
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh</ENAMEX> that makes sense
 	
 	
 		and um
 		you know i i wonder about credit uh
