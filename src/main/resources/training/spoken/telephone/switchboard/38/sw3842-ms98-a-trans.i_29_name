 		and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> that i'm renting the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> that i live in had the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">landlord</ENAMEX> provides the yard work
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> that we own i provide the yard work
 	
 	
 		okay this sounds kind of like  slightly jumbled situation there
 	
 	
 		i know  well the the one that i live in is not nearly so nice as the one i rent out though
 	
 	
 		uh that good income huh
 	
 	
 		i wanna preserve the the the value of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> by making sure the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">yard</ENAMEX> is taken care of
 	
 	
 		yes
 		okay
 	
 	
 		so i i go over to my other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and mow the yard and plant <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">bulbs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		yes

 		i adore it
 	
 	
 		yeah it's real relaxation
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> ran a service <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty nine years</TIMEX> and his
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i mean when when i was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX> i didn't realize how true it was but he always said that that was the best way he knew of to wind to wind down after a hard day at work was to come home and put in a hard day in the garden
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and especially you know just hoeing just hoeing up the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">weeds</ENAMEX> it was  therapy to him
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i guess it still is but uh
 		and i didn't seem that way when i was like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten years old</TIMEX> but
 	
 	
 		did you mow the yard when you were younger or do stuff like that
 	
 	
 		oh yeah yeah um we had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about a quarter</NUMEX> of an acre worth of lawn between our my my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and our next door neighbor
 	
 	
 		ooh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		they were a rather elderly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> so we cut their <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">lawn</ENAMEX> for them
 		but uh
 		there's <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about a half acre</NUMEX> worth of garden we kept
 		so when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> and
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> we
 		we kept it worked up pretty well it was a lot of fun as long as you know  your heart was in it at least least to some extent or another
 	
 	
 		do you still do yard work
 	
 	
 		well uh since i moved away from home i got to live in a place that had a yard
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so  i not really
 	
 	
 		do you do anything anything like um uh <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house plants</ENAMEX> or
 	
 	
 		yes we've actually gotten to the point where uh for a while i couldn't seem to keep anything alive
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i couldn't even grow <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">weeds</ENAMEX> in the house
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about three years ago</TIMEX> my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> and i somehow another seemed to have turned into green thumbs we got we pinched off a uh <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a couple couple of a twigs</NUMEX> from a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house plant</ENAMEX> of her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>'s
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		oh gosh
 	
 	
 		and wrapped them in a wet paper towel and brought them <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> with us
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and put them in a jar of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Miracle Grow</ENAMEX> and water and these this thing took off and we planted them and now it's a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant uh  plant</ENAMEX> we pinched them off of was kind of full and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">leafy</TIMEX> but it was only about
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">inches</NUMEX> high off the top of the pot this thing's <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about five feet</NUMEX> tall now
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		ooh what is it
 	
 	
 		and i don't know
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it it's this you know some little broad leaf something or other we
 		but uh it's it's got real thick thick stalks to it that like i say it's the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> of those stalks <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">over five feet</NUMEX> tall
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but uh they're just growing like mad once we got that thing going we wound up with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about five</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house plants</ENAMEX> that are all doing real well some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> gave us some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aloe vera</ENAMEX> and it
 	
 	
 		oh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it's doing well i mean it's had it's bad spots but
 	
 	
 		i killed an aloe vera
 	
 	
 		uh it's had its rough times but yeah but it's it's doing real well now um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i brought her a uh a couple of
 		i don't even know what they're called looks like overly large <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">lawn grass</ENAMEX> but it just a broad leaf type of along net kind of like a a leaf on a stalk of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">corn</ENAMEX> but greener it's
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		oh yeah <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">um corn</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> those are called <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">corn</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> or or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dracaena</ENAMEX> or they're some kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dracaena</ENAMEX> but common name's <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">corn</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> i think
 	
 	
 		short <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house plant</ENAMEX> pardon
 		yeah well it doesn't get a stalk the the leaves all come out of the center it doesn't really resemble corn other than the shape of the leaf itself it is about like the shape of a leaf a leaf on a stalk of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">corn</ENAMEX> but it's not on a
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh huh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		stalk it's just all out of the center
 	
 	
 		huh that's i don't i know i have one of those that's not doing very well but
 		i think i know what you're talking about
 	
 	
 		yeah and uh it doesn't seem to flower any and let's see we've got a little somebody gave us a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fichus</ENAMEX> and uh
 		uh when we <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> got it no well we came close we got really close
 	
 	
 		you you haven't killed it
 		
 
 	
 	
 		um when we <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> got it she kept moving it back and forth from our own front porch to the uh inside and she never could quite decide where she wanted it inside
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and it had shed almost all its leaves it looked really scraggly and rough and when somebody finally told us the only way to treat those things is to put them some place and leave them
