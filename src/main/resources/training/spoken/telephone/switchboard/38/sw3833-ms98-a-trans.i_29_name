 
     		
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh do you work outside the home
 	
 	
 		um i did until my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> went bankrupt
 	
 	
 		oh poor baby
 	
 	
 		yeah now right now i haven't been able to locate a job down here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Patterson</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it's kind of a small
 		city so
 		i've been going to Modesto which is larger but it's not like being in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bay area</ENAMEX> where i came from
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but anyhow when i did work in the winter time i wore uh my <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wool skirts</ENAMEX> and sweaters and boots
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		because the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bay area</ENAMEX> gets kind of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">chilly</TIMEX> in the winter time
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and um then in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX> time i just wore you know the polyester <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blouses</ENAMEX> and usually usually pants and just uh heels you know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so uh where do you work at
 	
 	
 		i work for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX> and uh i have to dress somewhat more formally
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 		right
 	
 	
 		so i i look like the little old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX> preppie
 	
 	
 		you  do you i don't suppose you can wear pants
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh no i i guess i could but i don't
 	
 	
 		oh because i never see anybody in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX> out here it seems like i never see them with pants on
 	
 	
 		no no we don't wear pants uh i i wear suits
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh almost exclusively
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		have you ever had a uh a color analysis
 	
 	
 		no no i haven't
 	
 	
 		uh
 		well it's a very interesting process
 		uh according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX> that did mine she called them <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> and winter
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">spring</TIMEX> and fall and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX> she said you could call them A <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">B C D</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one two three four</NUMEX> or whatever
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but there are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that look better in the cool colors
 		than than the other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> look better in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">earth</ENAMEX> and warm colors
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summers or winters</TIMEX>
 		and uh
 		uh it's really an interesting process and i found out i was a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> so i look much better in the the blues pinks
 		uh
 		the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the winters</TIMEX> uh wear stronger colors
 		but basically the same types of colors but as a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> i'm not supposed to wear uh black or stark white
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		uh
 		the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winters just winters</TIMEX> wear black and white and the summer uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the spring</TIMEX> and and fall colors wear well i have a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> in law that uh
 		uh this the the camouflage colors the khakis and olive drab green
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		just make her eyes light up like crazy yeah and then i i also have a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> in law who has auburn hair
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		isn't that
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so  she wears the earth colors uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oranges</ENAMEX> and the olive <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">drab greens</ENAMEX> and the khakis and and uh they're most becoming to her so it it it really is an interesting
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		hum
 	
 	
 		analysis
 	
 	
 		yeah that would be interesting to do um i worked for a trucking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> so we didn't really even have to dress up at all if we didn't want to we could wear pants all the time you know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but uh i just in the winter time i just like to wear boots and you know the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wool skirts</ENAMEX> and the sweaters and everything
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but uh  i've never gone to and had a you know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		anything like that done to tell me exactly what color i would look best in
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh i know i don't look good in yellow but i like pink and blue you know and red
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		uh yeah uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but uh i just look in the mirror and
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah well reds uh i i have to have a red that leans towards the the blue uh in other words it leans toward the maroon
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but the reds that lead lean toward the orange don't do a thing for me
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so i have to be careful about reds
 	
 	
 		uh-huh huh very interesting
