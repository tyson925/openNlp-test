 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well are you in the market for a new car
 	
 	
 		uh well yeah i am as a matter of fact  well actually actually i'm looking for another car but uh uh new probably not
 	
 	
 		oh what sort of requirements to you have for your car
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> sports <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>  uh usually either black or red
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		um
 	
 	
 		and and electric windows and power locks  no
 	
 	
 		i see
 		top of top of the line
 	
 	
 		well uh not so much that as it is i've had so many times when uh uh you know i i'll have a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> next to me or i see somebody
 		uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> broken down on the side of the road and try to lean over and roll down the window
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		it is just a real pain or you know if i'm driving along and there's somebody next to me and uh somebody that i know and you try to talk to them it's real difficult to drive reach reach over and try to roll down the window
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		right right
 	
 	
 		and uh so power locks and power windows are just  just things that uh uh just really help a lot  what about you
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		well i guess i'm um more traditional in that i don't like power  power windows or power locks because  the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that i know have who have them always seem to have trouble with them
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and um  so i don't i just don't like anything that i can't figure out why it doesn't work  and then i want you know good uh gas mileage and i want an air bag and
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		uh i guess a good
 	
 	
 		have you ever had a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> with an air bag
 	
 	
 		no i haven't have you
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		somehow i just think you know i like the idea
 	
 	
 		well it it seems sure seems to save lives and uh  yeah i actually i like the antilock brakes
 	
 	
 		right
 		right that's a good idea
 	
 	
 		and i've never had a chance to i have been in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> that have had them but  i've never tromped on the brakes to see uh you know on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> just to see if they didn't lock up
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but uh you think you'd buy uh an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> or a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japanese</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		well i actually i don't know a lot about different brands i tend to have you know my requirements like the last time i bought a car i i guess i did sort of prefer <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> and my requirements were basically you know good repair record
 		good mileage um
 		and i needed air-conditioning and um
 		can't remember what my oh i wanted uh stickshift
 		and so i didn't have a whole lot of choice there was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> in all of the the metropolitan area that i could find that
 		you know was sort of a medium priced <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> with a stickshift in it it it turned out to be a a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> um
 	
 	
 		what was that
 	
 	
 		Lancer
 	
 	
 		huh stick shift huh did it have what a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">three</NUMEX> speed or a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">four</NUMEX> speed
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		no a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">five</NUMEX> speed and it basically it was something that a military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> had ordered and hadn't picked up and so it had been on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lot</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three months</TIMEX> and they were really eager to sell it
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		so i guess in this area at least you know if it's not automatic it doesn't move
 	
 	
 		well actually i much prefer a stick shift
 		and what i'm i'm curious i i know why i love a stick shift why do you  why did you want one
 	
 	
 		well i just wanted it because again i had i guess traditionally always had a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> that had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> and i thought it would be more reliable
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		it's hard to find stick shift <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> anymore
 	
 	
 		i found that out  i mean you know the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> would just sort of look at me like you must be crazy when you went in to and they asked and said that was the requirement
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		huh
 		yeah no i mean most of the sports <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> are stick shift
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well i'm not even sure all of them are anymore at least in this area not that i was looking for sports <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> but  now the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> i've talked to  don't seem to have stick shift
 	
 	
 		huh
 		huh
 	
 	
 		and so why do you like stick shift
 	
 	
 		um i guess i i grew up on it and it's fun it's it's an enjoyable part of driving i do feel like i have uh more control
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		over the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> and it it to me it gives me more a lot more control in the snow and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> and slick conditions
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		right right
 	
 	
 		uh it it it does uh i don't know it it's really more fun than anything else as long as you're not stuck in heavy traffic it's fun
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		right and actually it's probably safer on you know uh long trips because it keeps you more active
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		yeah  uh of course i like gadgets and and uh fun things on on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> which are all the things course the could
