 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		what do you think about drug testing
 	
 	
 		well
 		unnecessary a necessary evil i guess
 	
 	
 		yeah i think that it's appropriate in some job categories uh jobs that involve safety and
 		you know that that performance of which really would have an effect on the the the lives and safety of other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> you know health <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who
 		uh operate machinery and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fly</ENAMEX> and or drive whatever i think that those are really important i'm not sure how i feel about about other jobs just
 		uh for the purpose of determining whether or not an employee is
 		drug free you know on on general principles
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		but i can really see the justification for the others
 	
 	
 		yeah uh i guess i'm uh
 		partly biased since we just recently our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>'s gone to the uh process of
 		initiating drug testing on a random basis
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh</ENAMEX> for all job categories
 	
 	
 		everybody uh in the corporation
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		so whether you're an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> behind a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">desk</ENAMEX> or you're operating a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicle</ENAMEX> or whatever
 	
 	
 		that's correct
 	
 	
 		and and how do they how do they do that how often generally does random mean
 	
 	
 		well it's uh
 		other than they uh they insisted on the uh you know management and
 		and supervision taking the uh being done within the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> year
 		which we've all been done you know
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">uh</ENAMEX> seems to be
 	
 	
 		so in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past month</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		the past year
 	
 	
 		oh since nineteen <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ninety one</NUMEX> it started is that right
 	
 	
 		uh right actually late in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ninety</NUMEX> it was
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but you know they it's fairly infrequent it's just that it's there you know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		when you say infrequent is it maybe once <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a quarter</NUMEX> or
 	
 	
 		oh Lord no i don't think uh
 		<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of all in my group
 		hardly a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> of them have been tested you know
 	
 	
 		how large is that group
 	
 	
 		uh it's about uh <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty</TIMEX> people
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		so what do you see as the reasons that they chose to do that
 		that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> chose to do that
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		was it insurance issue or
 	
 	
 		that uh they want to you know social uh issues
 	
 	
 		safety issue
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		so uh on a performance level there was actually
 		a problem with abuse of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substances</ENAMEX> and they wanted to make sure that they were reducing that or
 	
 	
 		yeah i think that
 		that was probably the prime motivation and insurance like you say to get uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 		what kind of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> is it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texas Instruments</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh i guess i should have figured  anybody i talk to in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> is is probably  from <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		interesting well
 		they really i guess i shouldn't stray from the subject but they have some very interesting topics for for questions
 		i often wonder who has created them
 	
 	
 		yeah i guess there uh
 		may have been just a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committee</ENAMEX> throwing out suggestions
 	
 	
 		was the response from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> regarding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> testing favorable or
 	
 	
 		it was uh it was received at our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">site</ENAMEX> here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Houston</ENAMEX>
 		fairly easily however in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Austin</ENAMEX> where they have a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineers</ENAMEX> and uh
 		i guess a younger set uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> they uh they were pretty uh a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> quit over it and uh quite a
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		quite a bit of furor yeah
 	
 	
 		interesting quit on general principle
 	
 	
 		i guess yeah there was some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that just actually quit because of the
 		their uh objection to the policy being forced on them you know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh</ENAMEX> is there some concern that the tests may not be completely accurate that you might be taking some prescription <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medication</ENAMEX> and and
 	
 	
 		uh i don't know how much of that there is i don't think it's that big of an issue because they've hired a national <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> and it's you know handled
 	
 	
 		be interpreted correctly
 	
 	
 		<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> and there's supposed to be a lot of safe <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guards</ENAMEX> and all that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		do you know if anyone's been uh
 		um
 		disciplined or
 	
 	
 		oh yes they've they've they've been <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that have been uh
 		the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> has a
 		you get a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> step process the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time if you're caught you have to uh take a uh you know go into a program to even if you're not you know
 		still have to go into a program even
 	
 	
 		so even if it's you know one time
 	
 	
 		yeah if you're if you're you're high you know if you fail the test whatever reason you have to go in into a program and uh course that can be very quickly taken care of if you're not a habitual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> or whatever
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		then uh after that <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time chance then the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> time it's automatic termination so
 	
 	
 		seems fair certainly if <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are prepared for the fact that
 		there's a chance they're going to be tested you think they'd be smart enough if they did have a problem to eliminate their use
 	
 	
 		yeah well it's
 		it's almost become a uh non topic anymore
