 
     		
 	
 		uh it was about the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vietnam</ENAMEX> right
 	
 	
 		
 
 		the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Vietnam War</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah well uh
 		guess uh i'm <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twenty three</NUMEX> are you older than i am
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm forty one so i would uh
 	
 	
 		so you probably have a better opinion of of what
 	
 	
 		well i uh was in college when the war escalated to it's height and uh
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		i guess my feeling is consistent with that of uh the general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> that it was unfortunate
 		event uh
 		it's real interesting to think about it in the context of this new movie JFK which is
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		apparently linking the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kennedy</ENAMEX> assassination to his decision to his uh uh the apparently <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> uh who worked for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kennedy</ENAMEX> say he didn't decide that he was gonna
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		pull out of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vietnam</ENAMEX> was not going to commit more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> that that had nothing to do with the assassination of those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> say but they that he had come to that conclusion
 	
 	
 		um
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i think it was uh
 		particularly in light of recent events a really unfortunate mistake Communism was self destructing even then and uh
 		the history of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Vietnam</ENAMEX> which has been uh represented in a number of different commentaries and documentaries <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> on the public broadcasting system
 		uh it seems that it just didn't have to happen and i think uh its a valuable
 		uh if painful lesson for this country
 	
 	
 		yeah i mean looking back now know what we know now i mean it was just a complete disaster
 	
 	
 		right
 		at the time i wasn't that uh
 		wasn't that sure i i i really didn't know enough about it and wasn't that politically active uh
 		but it was
 		um
 		apparently something that could've been avoided and i you know i i look at wars generally as falling into that category um
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are beginning to wonder whether or not the uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Gulf War</ENAMEX> could've been avoided even though that was a remarkably painless war and as wars go
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah i just think
 		that the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Gulf War</ENAMEX> was just something that was really
 		um
 		i know it's i kind of look at it as a little bit of propaganda in a way because i mean we basically went in and spent i don't know how many <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">billions of dollars</NUMEX> and
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		just beat up on a
 	
 	
 		<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> world <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> really
 	
 	
 		inferior yeah inferior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX> that was just wanting wanting to quit and didn't have any <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> and i mean it's just i don't know how much pride one can really take in that and
 	
 	
 		well i think what what's uh i i guess i'd use the word relevant to the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Vietnam War</ENAMEX> question is that the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Vietnam War</ENAMEX> was apparently avoidable too it was a time when <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ho Chi Minh</ENAMEX>
 		apparently came to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> and said look if you're willing to provide me with support all i wanna do is unify <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vietnam</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh he was turned away by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Truman</ENAMEX> um
 		so it's
 		hum
 		a painful lesson i guess one that we're beginning to learn i'm really impressed by how much effect some of these movies have had on public consciousness the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JFK</ENAMEX> movie's cause causing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> after another to
 		call for the release of the documents that have been sealed
 	
 	
 		oh yeah that's just um
 	
 	
 		did you see any of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vietnam</ENAMEX> Wars um any of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Vietnam war</ENAMEX> movies
 	
 	
 		i've seen uh you know <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Apocalypse Now</ENAMEX> and um
 		uh what was the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> with um <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher Waken</ENAMEX> and um
 	
 	
 		oh the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deer Hunter</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deer Hunter</ENAMEX> yeah i've you know and the just a lot of other i guess inferior ones made but i mean as far i think <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apocalypse Now</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">um Deer Hunter</ENAMEX> were just
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		those <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> yep
 	
 	
 		just incredible movies you know <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deer Hunter</ENAMEX>'s a little bit more of a incident but
 	
 	
 		yeah they were they've
 		yeah well they were both remarkable films as a matter of fact there's a new film out about the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Vietnam War</ENAMEX> about the making of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apocalypse</ENAMEX> Now which itself is suppose to be a great yeah have you is it good
 	
 	
 		yeah <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Heart of Darkness</ENAMEX> yeah i've seen that that was uh it's great they had it on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Showtime</ENAMEX> um  before they released it to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">theaters</ENAMEX> fact
 		around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX> and uh it's really something it's almost it it's just as entertaining if not more entertaining than a film is because it's
 	
 	
 		that's what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> say i'm really looking forward to seeing his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> apparently made it from documentary
 	
 	
 		right she just shot documentary you know had like a little hand held camera and you know the whole thing's been edited together but when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin Sheen</ENAMEX> had his heart attack it's just amazing what you know <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frances</ENAMEX> is just
 	
 	
 		oh is is that on film did that that get captured on film
 	
 	
 		it it doesn't capture the actual event it captures him getting uh some treatment after it happened but she had a tape <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> running when he was talking on the phone about it and
 		he's just literally freaking out i mean about he's more concerned about the you know how because he's as the whole time i guess when it was being made um i was just a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX> back then but i guess it's just
 		the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> back in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> just were hearing about it how it was just such a disaster during this is like the last thing he need is is for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marty</ENAMEX> to have a heart attack i mean you'll you'll love it i mean it's it's really great um
 	
 	
 		right right right
 		yeah well i  the thing i think is really neat about
