 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		so have you remodeled your <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> recently
 	
 	
 		i haven't done too much uh i mostly get stuck doing repairs like broken replacing a broken window the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX> threw a rock through the window with his lawn mower
 	
 	
 		can you do that yourself or do you have it done
 	
 	
 		i did that myself and it kind of surprised me i just paid attention to how i took it out and went to the hardware <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX> and got a new one and put it back in
 	
 	
 		and then you put putty around the edges
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah that's all there was to it
 	
 	
 		i'm i'm impressed that you did that though
 	
 	
 		well the screen still has a hole in it so don't be too impressed
 	
 	
 		
 
 		we um live in our current <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about three years</TIMEX> and we've only done minor repairs like painting and we did put a new roof on but previously we had owned a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eighty year</TIMEX> old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> in another city
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		and that's where i got my real experience at repairs and so i've replaced many windows
 	
 	
 		i'll bet you have
 	
 	
 		but they had wooden they were wooden windows and um i don't know for some reason it the putty seemed easier or something because it blended in
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 		yeah what all did you do to your <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eighty year old</TIMEX> home did you totally remodel it or had
 	
 	
 		well uh we had a lot of it done i can't claim to have done much of it it had wood floors that we had refinished commercially so that they were all um even tiled what do you i forgot what you call that where you  skim the top and then revarnish
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and we had it had real plaster walls so we had a lot of plasterwork done
 		we bought when we bought the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> uh most of the walls were covered in fabric and although it was sort of pretty when we went through it once that the previous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> had their furniture out it looked pretty bad so when then we took down the
 	
 	
 		i'll bet yeah
 	
 	
 		um fabric to find huge plaster cracks
 	
 	
 		oh no
 	
 	
 		not unexpected i suppose but so we repaired a lot of that and then um we didn't do any real major we moved <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">just a couple</NUMEX> walls
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		and we put in new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bathroom</ENAMEX> fixture not not we kept the fixtures but we put in like a new we did put in a new bathtub and then we sort of bought the antique looking
 		you know the brass plumbing type thing although it was new
 	
 	
 		oh the
 		oh yeah uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i like old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> but it is everyone talks about it it's true small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bathrooms</ENAMEX> and small closets
 	
 	
 		that that's right yes i lived for a while in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX> and i was so impressed with the old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> there that the big old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> but i know <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> were constantly remodeling them and fixing them up
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		and plumbing you have to know a lot about plumbing
 	
 	
 		that's right and those lovely old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> had no insulation whatsoever
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know we had we ran into an interesting complication um our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> it had fifty <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> windows
 		so we decided in order with an exorbitant heat bill we decided one way we would attack that we put storm windows on and then we put insulation in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">attic</ENAMEX> a a lot of it because we didn't have very much the problem and we never anticipated it was in the summertime
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		the humidity it it would rise and in the stairwell at the top of the stairwell it literally would um the humidity would condense on the walls so that the walls would sort of sweat and
 		when we had an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineer</ENAMEX> come out and talk he just said that we had over insulated our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> so it quote couldn't breath
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and so the humidity when it would you know that the the highest point would go up there and then and then would condense and it was it was really a problem
 	
 	
 		i'll bet it was did it damage the walls
 	
 	
 		well not you could i don't know i'm sure over the long term it would and it would kind of cause sort of streaky pattern in the in the paint
 		um we put in the first thing we tried we just put in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fan</ENAMEX> in that area so that we could circulate the air and hope that that would help um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		we actually took a screen uh door window off <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of windows  to try and allow a little ventilation in that area and then the truth is it then became
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		cooler weather and then we sold our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>  and i never i always hope that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> didn't have the same problem <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</TIMEX> it's all those things that you don't necessarily want to tell them i don't know i mean we weren't trying to be dishonest or anything you just
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		
 
 		well you gave it your best shot
 	
 	
 		we gave it our best shot but it was kind of ironic that we thought we were being so energy conscious and you know it's
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 		and overdid it
 	
 	
 		perhaps we overdid it
 	
 	
 		i'll bet that eighty year old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> had a lot of pretty moldings
 	
 	
 		its prettiest features it had beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wood</ENAMEX> molding high ceilings and it had beautiful cut glass french doors
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and um i suppose that was it's it's prettiest features but and the and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floors</ENAMEX> were beautiful
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but it much like the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Swiss Avenue</ENAMEX> area in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i don't i only have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> there
 		i don't think i have the energy or the money  for those sort of beautiful old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> now
 	
 	
 		
 
 		no i've just recently helped a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> put up crown molding in the in his guest bedroom
 		up around the ceiling of course it was a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> foot ceiling in there and it was a rather small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> to
 	
 	
 		that's
