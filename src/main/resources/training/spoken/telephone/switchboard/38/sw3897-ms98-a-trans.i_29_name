 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		well i don't know about you but neighborhoods just aren't like that anymore and if you can you know get together with an old neighborhood like that that is really neat

 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		oh sure and and to find out what happened to everybody right um-hum

 		on a plain sheet of typewriting paper and i took old photographs of my <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cousins um</ENAMEX> when they were little real little and just did kind of a collage
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		on on that you know and just just printed it on uh a real good copy machine uh you know you they weren't really good pictures but that you could tell who everybody was and it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and everybody got a big kick out of that because there were a lot of pictures that i had that nobody else had had

 		it was no it each each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> that lived in
 	
 	
 		it was it was different than that
