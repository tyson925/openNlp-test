 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh oh
 		are you still there
 	
 	
 		yes i'm still here
 	
 	
 		oh i know what it was the answering machine must have run out of
 		
 
 		i i heard something click and i was like oh no it disconnected us
 	
 	
 		well that
 		no i think i think it's on i'm i'm so glad i got hold of you i want um something came up at work <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the other day</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are wondering how to choose a college
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i was wondering how what did your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> do to help you choose a college
 	
 	
 		well to be honest they didn't really do a lot i mean my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> sat me down i guess in junior high and said
 		um that i guess they had called him from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> and you know when they start giving you all those standardized tests and everything and you know <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dad</ENAMEX> said well you know you're a smart <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX> so
 		you're going to college and you're going to graduate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> so decide now what do you want to be  here here are your choices you can be a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX> uh he gave me a list of choices all you know
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		the different professions and i was kind of like i didn't even know you know
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i had no clues so i said dad
 		well i can't stand the sight of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> so a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> is out and uh i'm not i can't do math so a lot of stuff is out um
 		i didn't think i'd be a very good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX> because i like to draw but not that way so i said well i guess i'll be a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> because i think they help people
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">boy</ENAMEX> was i stupid
 		so <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dad</ENAMEX> said okay fine you're going to be a lawyer
 		so then when it got time to you know get close to you know you start getting college brochures and stuff  my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> kind of said well uh what's the best law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> in the country
 		and all his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> told him <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard</ENAMEX> and he goes okay well i think you should go there for undergraduate too
 		so i was like okay fine
 		so i like uh send them the uh you know do the what do you call it
 		you know send for the things you fill out and filled out the forms and um they interview you they always have one of their alums interview you and at the time i applied you had to do it through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Radcliff</ENAMEX> because
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		used to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard</ENAMEX> was for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Radcliff</ENAMEX> was for the girls
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and even though they were combined
 		you know even though they had to let <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard</ENAMEX> you still had to apply through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Radcliff</ENAMEX> so
 		i did all this and uh a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Radcliff</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alum</ENAMEX> here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX>  did my interview and basically <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard</ENAMEX> has a recognized and constitutionally upheld quota system
 		and they told me that i was provisionally accepted but that if that they got a black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> or something that was qualified from this area that i would be bumped because i'm just a basic you know
 		wasp type <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> so  i'm not really
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		you know they had this minority recruitment thing
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		so and sure enough <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about two weeks</TIMEX> before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> started i found out that they had taken uh they uh found a black girl
 		and uh took her instead so the only thing i could do was i had to go somewhere that you could pretty much register and start <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next day</TIMEX> so
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Texas</ENAMEX> was where my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> went to school and luckily it's kind of that way so i went down there and late registered and basically started classes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> after i registered
 	
 	
 		so you got to choose a college twice
 	
 	
 		yeah by myself
 	
 	
 		good grief
 	
 	
 		i mean my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> didn't really you know my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> was the first
 		well my mom
 		they were the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> that had been to college
 		which i know like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> from the east coast
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">colleges</ENAMEX> are all around you you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and so everybody goes to college or it's more normal i think because a lot of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> that are from the east coast you know everybody in their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>'s been to college but out here you know in fact my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> hasn't really been to college college they had a junior college
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that was fairly close by and and so she that's all she ever did was go to junior college
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		just you know <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two year</TIMEX> college and and got her degree but you know then my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> went back to school and finished school and went to professional school
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but that was after my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> and i were already little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> so nobody in my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> really knew how to advise me
 	
 	
 		that was the same way in in my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of course my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> were divorced so it was just <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> and my grandparents
 		but <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the key things then was what could we afford to do
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and i got a a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">co-op</ENAMEX>
 		deal at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX> and i was there for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of years</TIMEX> before i flunked out
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well where did you go to school in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and that choice
 	
 	
 		i bet that was neat
 	
 	
 		yeah it was but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> out <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> numbered the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty or thirty</TIMEX> to one
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		
 
 		but uh it was just a very small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> about <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three hundred</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> but the big the reason for choosing it was because of the financial aid that was available
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and it
 	
 	
 		that is really critical <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these days</TIMEX> i think
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		but then i
 		my next choice in college was hey i move back with <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mom</ENAMEX> and i i went to the local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">university</ENAMEX> to get my grade point back up
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		so a decent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> would let me in
