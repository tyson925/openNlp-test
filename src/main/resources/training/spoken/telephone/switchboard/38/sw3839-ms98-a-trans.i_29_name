 		well that's not that old of a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> but things do change from time to time don't they
 	
 	
 		no
 		that's right they they they do change and and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bathrooms</ENAMEX> you know if you have any <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> leakage anywhere can uh slowly deteriorate things and so you got to plug those leaks up
 	
 	
 		y'all have <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">basements</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> don't you
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>

 		is that right well is the water level high there
 	
 	
 		uh no we build them on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pier</ENAMEX> and beams as they up for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">few years back</TIMEX> and then what's popular now is just called a slab
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and we don't have snow to speak of

 		oh i see
 		i declare
 	
 	
 		uh the last home project i guess well <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year and a half ago</TIMEX> we bought a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> that had laid vacant for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about two years</TIMEX> and had been
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well sad situation estate thing and we've kind of put the whole thing back together uh the biggest thing i did was uh refenced and redecked in the back
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		oh i see are you doing this yourself
 	
 	
 		are you kidding
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i'd rather sell an extra insurance policy than use a hammer and a nail it wouldn't be straight anyway
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i declare oh well
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		let's see and we we found a part time fireman and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">policeman</ENAMEX> and in their so so called spare time they moonlight
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and we get a lot better price than trying to use a professional yellow page advertised uh
 	
 	
 		that's true these lot of fellows uh uh really really want to work pretty hard so they willing to come at little bit more reasonable prices i'm sure of that i just had some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guttering</ENAMEX> also replaced on my home
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">personnel</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh i actually replaced all the other guttering <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> and and the piece that i did <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> seemed all right at the time so i left it alone
 	
 	
 		have you heard of that continuous guttering they have now
 	
 	
 		that's what i put up this last time it's one solid piece <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about thirty feet</NUMEX> long
 	
 	
 		no kidding
 		were you were you happy did they make it right there on your property
 	
 	
 		no it was uh brought out on a truck
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		so i i it was it i have seen these things done they uh they come on great big large wheels i think of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">material</ENAMEX> and they roll it off
 	
 	
 		i haven't seen it done when we moved into the uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> we
 		we got guttering bids we finally repaired briefly what we've got for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than a hundred</NUMEX> bucks those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> were gonna sell me a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">three thousand</NUMEX>
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		go ahead and uh they talked about bringing a machine out and just making it right there in the front yard and putting it up as they make it so i've never seen one
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well this as i say this was already uh they had come out and measured it and brought out the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> pieces at the correct length and all they had to do is mount them and then uh seal <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> joint where the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> ends came together
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i just thought of a project i did my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> wanted an island in the kitchen
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		well we the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> isn't that new so i built a uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		a uh
 		a table
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		from the local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hardware store</ENAMEX> we have a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outfit</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Home Depot</ENAMEX> which is probably local down here but i ordered a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Formica</ENAMEX> top with rounded corners
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and then they have premade and bevelled uh legs and braces and so i simply took my counter top and put legs on it and braces and and uh put it together and uh
 	
 	
 		worked all right huh
 	
 	
 		for and it worked just fine it was premeasured the legs were premeasured exactly the same length so it's level hold it i have to put <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> business cards underneath it  that's pretty damn close for an amateur
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that's very very close i
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		as they say down south you done good
 	
 	
 		yeah had somebody come through and he said my gosh if you had bought that at a store it'd been <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven hundred</NUMEX> and fifty dollars and i got out for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about a hundred and forty five</NUMEX> i think
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		well that sounds great
 	
 	
 		so i was happy
 	
 	
 		yeah well i've got this uh the we were talking earlier about my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> i've got <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> more <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bathroom</ENAMEX> to rebuild and uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		we also have a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a</NUMEX> a porch that extends out from our master <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedroom</ENAMEX> that we want to rebuild it's uh taken a beating over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</TIMEX> and um now we're a little afraid to walk out on it because some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wood</ENAMEX> is deteriorating
 	
 	
 		how nice
 		are y'all in the mountains
 	
 	
 		uh we're in between the mountains we're we're in uh what we're called <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nitny Valley</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Penn State</ENAMEX> i
