 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and it's but it has been real icky well no it it rained <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> it rained
 		it stopped raining <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> it was it was clear but it's been really nasty the clouds have been over cast even though it's been kind of warm so that it is muggy
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that wasn't very good either
 	
 	
 		did you get some snow a while back
 	
 	
 		uh we did we got snow <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about a week</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a half ago</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		that's what i thought
 	
 	
 		and it was it was really wild because uh
 		the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">snow</ENAMEX> was um
 		it didn't stick
 	
 	
 		oh uh
 	
 	
 		but it flurried and you could see it
 		but it uh it didn't stick any
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		yeah it was nice it turned into it was like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rain</ENAMEX> it because it was warm even it was above freezing
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		wow
 	
 	
 		but it was between uh
 		just where the clouds were and where you know but when the snow got down here
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it was cold enough to freeze it and then it just stayed frozen it was wet snow i guess is what they call it when is starts thawing before it hits the ground
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		we haven't had anything like that
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		yeah it's only um it's only froze we have only had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> freezes so far <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this winter</TIMEX> but i think it is going to be a lot warmer soon
 	
 	
 		oh yeah well i am wondering about the summer what is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> going to be like if <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> is this temperate
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		we are bound to have a real dozy of a summer
 	
 	
 		that's what i think  but with all this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rain</ENAMEX> all the all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> ought to be real pretty
 	
 	
 		but
 		i don't know i've i've had um i have <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Easter</ENAMEX> lilies that i grow in my back yard and they have already started up
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		wow
 	
 	
 		and it's way too early
 	
 	
 		yes it is
 	
 	
 		for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Easter</ENAMEX> lilies they shouldn't be up until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX> when the the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> actually start to bloom
 	
 	
 		yeah i've seen <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Day</TIMEX> lilies uh not Day lilies daffodils around <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> uh and blooming
 	
 	
 		already coming in bloom
 	
 	
 		and blooming
 	
 	
 		oh please
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i i put down crocus <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> thinking oh well it will get <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cold</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January and February</TIMEX> you know and i won't have to worry about it
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i don't think i am going to get crocus this spring
 	
 	
 		you might not you might not
 	
 	
 		no i don't think it got cold enough for them to come out
 	
 	
 		but do you have the wild <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> up there
 	
 	
 		we don't have as many wild <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> here as there are down toward <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Austin</ENAMEX> i use to go to school in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">San Marcus</ENAMEX> so i'm familiar with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Austin</ENAMEX> and the area
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		they ought to be really pretty this year
 	
 	
 		i think so i think the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">highways</ENAMEX> are going to be great
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i'm ready to travel
 	
 	
 		yeah we like to go out and take pictures of them and everything it they ought to be really off of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two ninety</NUMEX> especially is real nice
