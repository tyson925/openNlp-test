 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		well why don't you tell me about your lawn and gardening
 	
 	
 		oh let's see it hurts  um i don't know i do quite a bit of it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		do you do you have a large lawn
 	
 	
 		um pretty fairly fairly fair amount yeah yeah we switch <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> here and there do you like to garden
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		well  i like the yard to look nice but i can't say i really enjoy it
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yeah no i've i've got other things that i like to do and that's that's not my favorite
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i don't know sweating out there sweating in the sun you know and pulling <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">weeds</ENAMEX> and those stuff
 	
 	
 		oh no no i don't like that no
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		no not that part just the pretty part
 	
 	
 		yeah and i won't mow the lawn either and you know watering the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">lawn</ENAMEX> is a pain in the butt because we don't have a an electric system so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right right
 	
 	
 		or sprinkler system i should say so
 	
 	
 		yeah i like to get out in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and that's it
 	
 	
 		well what do you like to do when you garden
 	
 	
 		oh mostly i like to keep a little garden
 	
 	
 		oh so you actually grow vegetables
 	
 	
 		right right right just like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">um salad salad vegetables</ENAMEX> that kind of thing
 	
 	
 		well that's nice
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and um
 		that's about it
 		just you know and shrubbery and everything and to keep the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">weeds</ENAMEX> down and stuff put mulch around it so you don't have to weed them
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah you know i i find that gardening for me is just uh it it's expensive
 	
 	
 		it really is
 	
 	
 		you know you get into buying as many <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> that you need to make it look good and you know you can't just buy <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two or three</NUMEX> you've got to buy <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a dozen</NUMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> small area
 	
 	
 		right
 		right right
 	
 	
 		you know so
 	
 	
 		so it doesn't look it looks skimpy if you don't
 	
 	
 		exactly and i know we've got <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this spring</TIMEX> we've got to push pull a bunch of stumps out because they're
 		they kicked the bucket so
 	
 	
 		oh heaven
 	
 	
 		well that means we'll just have to put something else
 		and so but you know we haven't we hadn't had any freeze damage <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> of course because it hasn't been that cold i guess it's been about the same with you all
 	
 	
 		really
 		right
 		right i think it's only frozen um we've had a freeze twice
 	
 	
 		yeah and i
 	
 	
 		and it wasn't very bad
 	
 	
 		and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rain</ENAMEX> is unbelievable i mean it's just
 	
 	
 		right  right did you get any snow
 	
 	
 		we got a few a few flakes last week
 	
 	
 		oh you're kidding really
 	
 	
 		just enough to make it look you know i mean it didn't even of course settle you know on the ground but it looked pretty while it was coming down
 	
 	
 		right
 		well that's nice
 	
 	
 		yeah what about you
 	
 	
 		no none none not none whatsoever so some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> are still kind of growing along
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so that makes it nice
 	
 	
 		that's true that's true ours are well they're they're kind of dormant they're pretty mellow right now
 	
 	
 		yeah but soon it'll be time to go out and put some bulbs i get enthusiastic in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the spring</TIMEX> and then it kind of dies down
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		a little while later when you have to take care of everything
 	
 	
 		in fact i just had a garden <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> come by and give me a well you know one of those places that fertilizes your <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">lawn</ENAMEX> give me an estimate because i just don't want to go out and buy all the chemicals and stuff because because i don't know what you need for this weed versus this weed versus this weed
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 		right
 	
 	
 		so i just let them treat all my <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">weeds</ENAMEX> and i won't have to deal with you know buying this stuff and having it sit in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garage</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		wow that's not bad
 	
 	
 		well yeah it's better for us because we don't we have a pretty small lawn
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		so and and you know the cost i think per time is a little less than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> bucks so
 	
 	
 		do they get get rid of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ants</ENAMEX> and stuff like that
 	
 	
 		i don't think they do the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ants</ENAMEX> i think they're just dealing with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">weeds</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh oh
 		not bad not bad at all though
 	
 	
 		no because we've got a real problem they're overtaking everything
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so but i mean we got some good grass but it's getting you know um
 	
 	
 		to the point where the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">weeds</ENAMEX> are taking over the grass
 	
 	
 		exactly it's getting choked out
 	
 	
 		oh my
 	
 	
 		well i think we covered it don't you do you know anything else you want to talk about about gardening
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh let's see i still have onions growing in the garden
 	
 	
 		you you still have onions growing
 	
 	
 		well they'll in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> they'll go <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all year</TIMEX> around
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and then if you want green onions you just go out there and grab some
 	
 	
 		so so do you go uh give them away that you have so many
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		you use them pretty much yourself
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		well that's good
 	
 	
 		yeah if you put them in all times of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> you can go out and take them you know for a green onion here and there and then if you have some left over they'll go to a a regular bulb onion and then you can have that the next um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		the next time <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next next year</TIMEX> yeah
 	
 	
 		so the green onions the green onions grow into the
 		the bigger onions
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		huh yeah they will if you let them alone and then you can put them anywhere sometimes i'll put mix them in with plants
 	
 	
 		wow
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		just have a bunch of green here and there
 	
 	
 		well you sound like somebody that needs to come to my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and  do a little work but
 	
 	
 		
 
 		and then oh let's see and then um i put <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rye</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">grass</ENAMEX> or my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> did put <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rye</ENAMEX> grass out <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this winter</TIMEX> to make it look green
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um right you put it around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September November</TIMEX> to make it look green
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		and that stuff fades away though right
 	
 	
 		right when it starts getting hot um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it'll start dying down and your regular grass will come back in
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh</ENAMEX> so it doesn't cover i mean it it it doesn't compete with the regular grass or anything
 	
 	
 		in the
 		no no no no huh-uh it has real shallow roots everything but you got to get out and mow it it looks nice for a while and then it goes away and it kind of fertilizes the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">grass</ENAMEX> that's there all the time
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
