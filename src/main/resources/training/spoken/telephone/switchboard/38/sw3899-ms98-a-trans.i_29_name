 		okay i pushed it
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		so what do you think um we can do to uh prevent air pollution
 	
 	
 		well um i worry about incineration you know i worry that we're we're doing way too much of that although i'm not sure
 		the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> thing that i have trouble with is wood smoke whether how whether that's a very serious one or not um
 		you know uh with
 	
 	
 		yeah well you know what i was talking to my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Denver</ENAMEX>
 		and he told me that they have restrictions on when they can burn their fireplace
 	
 	
 		well that's what i've heard it kills me  because i love fires and i and i really really care about <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pollution</ENAMEX> and i don't use anything that's got the the the stuff stuff the
 	
 	
 		yeah i couldn't believe
 	
 	
 		stuff in it you know the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spray</ENAMEX> bottles and i uh try to do everything i can but that's the one thing that i think is
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		very difficult is is uh wood fires because it seems to me that they were natural
 	
 	
 		yeah i can't understand
 	
 	
 		that's a that's a natural process and unlike unlike you know all of the rest of it but
 	
 	
 		yeah i just couldn't figure out how could they could restrict uh you know like a fireplace because a lot of places that's all that all the heat they have in their home
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that that that's what they have yeah  but um i you know i i am really concerned about it because you can you're beginning to well you're beginning to see the air
 	
 	
 		you know
 		well i know yeah isn't that terrible
 	
 	
 		and  and that's frightening and i know in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> uh a whole lot is being done i don't know how well that's working and if all those things all those laws went through
 		about about the for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturers</ENAMEX> and everything and has that do you know
 	
 	
 		well i don't know all i know is that we have to have our car our <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car smogged</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every two years</TIMEX> you know and um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		but i think what they're gonna do is try to get the try to get the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturers</ENAMEX> to make <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> that you know use <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gasoline</ENAMEX> more more uh better and and more cleanly or use cleaner fuel
 	
 	
 		um-hum  well you think that they would be able to do that you know i think they could too you know they just  they don't wanna they wanna use uh
 	
 	
 		i think they can do that i i think
 	
 	
 		you know something that's gonna burn all this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> where we can buy more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX>  you know
 	
 	
 		yes i think that's right i think that's right but it's scary what it's doing to to stone <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know the the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid rain</ENAMEX> i mean destroying things <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> are dying lot of forests are are dying of these uh in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> and in in uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i don't know about i don't know about in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		well i don't know about that either but uh i know i took a ride down <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southern California</ENAMEX> just recently and it was just amazing to look you know like being up higher and looking down and seeing all this
 		crud you know it oh it's terrible
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah well and and i had not experienced it as much my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> went to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pomona</ENAMEX> and he went
 		the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> starts in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fall</TIMEX> and that is the notorious smog season so when he <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> went out there <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about five</TIMEX> you know <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh a long time ago <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four or five years ago</TIMEX> but anyway he he called and just said <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>  now i know what they're talking about i mean this stuff you really feel you can't breathe
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 		yeah it it it does it burns your eyes and everything but a lot of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trucks</ENAMEX> that's on the road now to i think they could do something to those because some of those <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trucks</ENAMEX> just smoke like heck you know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		but it doesn't seem like no one ever does anything about that
 	
 	
 		no i know and and as far as what i you know i do things about almost everything else but as far as the air is concerned i am trying to buy a new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> but there are no <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> available with clean fuel
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so i can't do that um i just
 	
 	
 		no the electric <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> i think that was a good idea i would really go for that
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		uh yeah i would too but that and it it's not affordable and it's not out there
 	
 	
 		yeah right right
 	
 	
 		and then i have stopped using anything  but pump <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sprays</ENAMEX> so that i'm trying to get i'm trying not to use that whatever that's called <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chlorofluorocarbons</ENAMEX>
 		some kind of  anyway that's that's hurting the ozone uh level i'm trying not to do that
 	
 	
 		i
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		the bad thing i do is wood fires
 	
 	
 		yeah well uh we have a fireplace here to i don't burn it <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">every night</TIMEX> usually i just have mine on the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekends</TIMEX> or when i have <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> that we're gonna be in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all day</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh no no no i didn't either yes
 	
 	
 		you know and it's just nice to sit in the living <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> with a fireplace going but um other than that i don't use mine
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah but
 		no and i i'm not sure  i'm not sure that this is something that air pollution is something <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> can work on as much as they can on some of the other ones
 		uh like recycling or even water you know <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> use or saving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> and that's what's scary to me
 	
 	
 		yeah right
 		right right
 		yeah i know i think it's gonna have to be these large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> and uh-huh
 	
 	
 		large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> that's right industry and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturers</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		right right right right so
 	
 	
 		and uh that  we have less control i guess it depends on who we vote for and how we write
 		you know write letters to them
