 		oh i well i haven't seen either of those
 	
 	
 		you've never seen <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern Exposure</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">huh-uh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh it's a great show
 	
 	
 		um
 		i also like to watch <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Star Trek</ENAMEX> but it's on so late here that i don't always get to see it
 	
 	
 		really yeah we like it too
 		have you seen the movie
 	
 	
 		uh i haven't seen any of the movies  because i just barely just like in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last year or so</TIMEX> got interested in it and they're you know already out with number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> by now but
 		so i haven't seen any of the movies yet but i
 	
 	
 		oh you haven't seen any of them
 	
 	
 		
 
 		no
 	
 	
 		oh well they're good
 		they're real good
 		they're uh
 		they're getting rid of the old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cast</ENAMEX> for the movies though
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		which ones are you watching the new ones
 	
 	
 		yeah i've seen uh quite a few of the older ones i haven't seen really the new generation that much
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		is there one you prefer better the older <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or the younger the newer one
 	
 	
 		well they're
 		they're a lot different but i like i like the older ones because at that time you know they were really
 		futuristic you know
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and
 		the newer ones are
 		i guess the newer ones are real futuristic too but i like i like both of them
 	
 	
 		yeah i do too i have a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother-in-law</ENAMEX> who really likes the old ones
 		a lot i mean he almost hates the new ones  yeah because he he thinks the newer one is like a soap opera and the other one isn't or something but
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		whatever
 	
 	
 		no it's
 		not really
 		it's not really like a soap opera but
 	
 	
 		oh i think yeah
 	
 	
 		but it's
 		but that's true i mean you you learn more about the the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> and stuff but that's the way all shows are now
 	
 	
 		yeah sure
 		well let's see
 		um
 		i like to watch <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colombo</ENAMEX> because it's like a mystery thing
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and that's sort of how <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matlock</ENAMEX> is but <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colombo</ENAMEX> is
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> tricky i mean he doesn't even try to let the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> know he's getting onto them
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">uh</ENAMEX> did you see the one
 	
 	
 		well the it seems they always show Colombo the same ones over and over though
 		you know what i'm saying like that one where he goes to college
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">um</ENAMEX> did
 		
 
 	
 	
 		or those is there a series on
 	
 	
 		um yeah there's like one on well we see it <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Thursdays</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX>
 		and
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		it was this last time it was about this um movie director
 		did you happen did you see that one
 	
 	
 		yeah i saw that one see that was a rerun
 	
 	
 		really oh i guess i've never
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm wondering if that's
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		see i don't know if that's the the
 		movie of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the week</TIMEX> or
 		or what but it seems like there's only about
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four or five</NUMEX> different ones and then and they keep showing them over and over
 	
 	
 		oh i guess i've i haven't seen it before
 	
 	
 		he was a movie <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> and he had that gal killed
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		yeah on the set or something
 	
 	
 		that was pretty good though
 	
 	
 		yeah it was
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but i yeah i like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Colombo</ENAMEX> probably the best of any of those mystery things
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but um there's no never anything good on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturdays</TIMEX> though
 	
 	
 		no kidding
 	
 	
 		i don't think so well <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Star Trek</ENAMEX>'s on at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> but i'm never home
 		so
 	
 	
 		what is it that there's something i watch
 		something i watch on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturdays</TIMEX> and i can't remember what it is
 		now i used to watch <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Twin Peaks</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		you never saw that
 	
 	
 		i've heard of it a lot i've heard of a lot of
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> somehow or something they'll say so and so from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Twin Peaks</ENAMEX> or something you know
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah that was a definite soap opera
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		but it was it was a different type of show
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i didn't like the way it ended though
 	
 	
 		oh did they end the whole series
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		yeah they didn't they only did it for i think <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		but it's all over now
 	
 	
 		oh another show i like to watch is MASH
