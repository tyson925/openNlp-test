 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
  
 		uh creates some conversation anyway
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah so what do you think do you think they're honest or they in for it themselves or
 	
 	
 		oh no i i think uh i think they're honest i i you know there are some exceptions i think for the majority of them are honest and uh i just think in uh especially in the federal government the thing has just become bigger than
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		both of us all of us and it's just too big to handle and uh i think they look uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		they look a lot fairly incompetent at times and and i just think it's
 		i think they mean well they have good intentions and i as you know as far as the topic goes we as far as i'm concerned they're basically honest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> but uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 		well i was thinking if they were in for their for their own personal gain they're probably
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh
 	
 	
 		they what was that your other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">line</ENAMEX> or
 	
 	
 		oh i don't know what that go ahead go
 	
 	
 		yeah but they'd probably you know they'd stay in for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> or twelve years maybe but then get out and use those contacts they made and go work as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consultant</ENAMEX> for some of these private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">industries</ENAMEX> that
 	
 	
 		
 
 		let me get this other thing here hold on a second
 	
 	
 		okay
 		sure thing
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">hello</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it's still me
 	
 	
 		okay i don't know what that was
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh no i just think the
 		the uh federal government especially is just so huge i mean problems are so big and uh it's so
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		internationalized that uh i don't know it just i don't know what the solution is but uh i don't think they're in it for their own personal gain uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah there's actually you know you think you know they get paid what <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred and hundred and twenty five thousand</NUMEX> that's really not all that much compared to
 	
 	
 		right
 		well
 	
 	
 		what
 	
 	
 		considering that they have to live up there i mean the living conditions up there i mean not the conditions but the private cost of living is atrocious and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh i don't think a lot of them are making uh netting a whole lot of money once they leave up there
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		but uh
 	
 	
 		oh and i think a lot of them go in with a you know pretty <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">idealist</ENAMEX> approach that you know they can make some changes and stuff  but i think they get in they all of a sudden find out what the real life is  and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		right and they're just one of uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five hundred</NUMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty five</TIMEX> and you're just talking about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House of Representatives</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		exactly
 		well you look at even the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> you know he's got to fight against all you know the other <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five hundred thirty five</TIMEX> to get anything through anyway so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well i think anytime you've got a a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> and a uh oh a so-so <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">senate</ENAMEX> as far as uh the split between the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrats</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> and then the democratic uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> uh whoever's in power
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		is going to have their hands full and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah it doesn't
 		it's not really conducive to getting a lot done it sure seems like
 	
 	
 		no but uh it's too bad uh but i think it's like a lot of things whether it's a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> or an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> of some kind or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">goverment</ENAMEX> federal government it's uh it gets to be too big and uh it controls uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you don't have the proper controls in place well then it's going to get out of hand and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are going to look silly kind of foolish foolish and silly when they're uh trying to operate that thing
 	
 	
 		exactly
 		yeah and like you say it's
 		you know the right hand doesn't know what the left hand's doing and the do you know even mouth sometimes are doing going the opposite direction so
 	
 	
 		right
 		i know our state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> gets a lot of heck as well down here and uh i don't know about of course about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> i don't pay a whole lot of attention to the state government uh we've got a
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		a female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX> and she ran against a real clown here <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year or so ago</TIMEX> and both of them neither there just wasn't a whole lot to pick from
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah well there was that was a lot of that was public quite uh a public thing i mean we heard a lot about it on national news news that was that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Richards</ENAMEX> wasn't that her name
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 		right
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">uh Richards uh Ann Richards</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX> she won then <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clayton Williams</ENAMEX> was the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> that ran against her and he was a west <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> uh rancher and so forth
 	
 	
 		gal that won
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but uh they were both a
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> of clowns
 	
 	
 		seemed like there was more personal mud mud throwing than anything else if i if i remember the news reports and stuff but
 	
 	
 		well they
 		they had a good time it was serious business but i think they enjoyed themselves and a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> down here just
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		so are they doing any good is she doing any good or
 	
 	
 		oh
 		not really she i think uh they she's been in office just <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about a year</TIMEX> now and uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		as far as her public uh public opinion surveys i think they give her about a fifty fifty rating she she hasn't uh destroyed the place but the economy down here is in pretty bad shape and she can't do much about that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh she's she's done okay that who's to say how he would have done he he's a business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> he's been successful i i
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		if i had voted i would have voted for him but  she's done all right
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah did we just uh we got our <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman mayor</ENAMEX> up here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Salt Lake</ENAMEX> uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">just this past</TIMEX> election and uh you know they made a big deal of that but she's a business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> and that's what she was really pushing was
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		business mindedness in uh you know in government and stuff and some of those in same business philosophies and it will be interesting to see how she does because
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know she's kind of a self-made i don't know if she's a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">millionaire</ENAMEX> but she you know got her own <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX> and stuff but that was her big thing that she was pushing so
 	
 	
 		um
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		she a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republican</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh no she's <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrat</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		which uh
 	
 	
 		well you
 	
 	
 		actually <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Salt Lake</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">county</ENAMEX> around <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Salt Lake</ENAMEX> is quite a bit <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democrat</ENAMEX> so it's not really surprising we've had a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a</NUMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Democratic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mayor</ENAMEX> for quite a few years
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> as a whole is probably more definitely more <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> but
 	
 	
 		is that right
 	
 	
 		yeah it will be a lot it will be interesting to see how she does the you know there's
 		she's already stepped on a few toes i think she's making the changes but
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		well she's going to have to do
