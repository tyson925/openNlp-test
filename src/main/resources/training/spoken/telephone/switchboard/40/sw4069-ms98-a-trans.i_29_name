 
     		
 	
 		i'm an avid recycler um but our <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>'s not doing as much as they ought to what about you all there
 	
 	
 		
 
 		there is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> in town called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Nacogdoches Recycles</ENAMEX> that will meet i believe it's once <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a month</TIMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> and you can take plastics papers
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		or bottles
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but it's up to you to collect them it's up to you to get them down there and then what they do with them i don't know
 	
 	
 		you don't know yeah
 	
 	
 		there isn't any you somebody had had talked once before to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">City Council</ENAMEX> meeting about maybe having different colored waste cans
 	
 	
 		right that they pick up
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh</ENAMEX> because they do that in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Palestine</ENAMEX> and nobody wanted to go for that they were gonna charge a little extra on the bill and nobody wanted to do that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		right
 		nobody wanted to do it
 	
 	
 		and i save aluminum cans and
 		to take those to the to the closest place is about
 	
 	
 		it do you have a place to take them
 	
 	
 		it's <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about thirty minutes</TIMEX> away
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">wow</ENAMEX> is that right
 	
 	
 		yeah and it and the last time we took some things
 		the price is not really
 		worth it
 	
 	
 		worth it yeah not worth the gas huh yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah because by the time and you save them and squish them and
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		they're just they were everywhere
 	
 	
 		yeah oh i know i know it
 	
 	
 		and that's the bad thing about it and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX> we we started saving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX> and stuff well they just packed up and i have cats well they had a field day
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		destroyed those
 	
 	
 		now what do they do i have cats too but they don't do anything with newspaper
 	
 	
 		mine have some kind of paper thing oh yes any any kind of cardboard and paper and they just tear it up
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		do with their claws or chew it
 	
 	
 		um-hum both
 	
 	
 		how fascinating
 	
 	
 		i don't know what it is
 	
 	
 		oh isn't that interesting i've got <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX> don't seem to interest them at all
 	
 	
 		i don't know what it is and you can't leave the mail don't i don't leave the mail on on the coffee table or it's chewed up
 	
 	
 		oh no
 		is that right oh my gosh
 	
 	
 		and it was just really one i've got i've got several and one in particular but then she kind of showed the other ones what was going on
 	
 	
 		and then they learned how huh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh</ENAMEX> so now it's just a big play play time
 	
 	
 		well that's funny well i i we we do have more <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> than that around here so that we they're they are trying in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> to do some
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> curbside recycling they've got special special you they selected <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> and in those sites they they've been doing it and they've had a pretty good success so they're talking about
 		you know doing it more but it isn't in my area so i've got a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen</ENAMEX> full of you know cans and bottles and scrap metal and
 		everything and and then i have to drive it somewhere and there
 	
 	
 		yeah i think if they would make it a little more convenient for us everybody would
 	
 	
 		then everybody would do it well it's one of those things that makes you feel good you know makes you feel like you're part of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">of a</NUMEX> of a solution to a problem
 	
 	
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		and and uh there's not that much that makes you feel like you've got any control over anything so
 	
 	
 		oh i know and we take the little plastic bags back to the to the grocery store
 	
 	
 		back to the grocery so your grocery <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX> does that uh-huh yeah well that's good
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		but but <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">as far as</NUMEX> bottles and things go there isn't any place any any close
 	
 	
 		and that's strange because now bottles are the one thing that are totally recyclable they're the easiest and and uh you know i mean i try to keep and reuse and i
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		oh i even carry around uh you know like if i i i travel around the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> a lot so that i'm frequently stopping at fast food place and eating  in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> or on the way to the next site
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i've gotten to saving the plastic forks and washing them and using them again so i don't keep doing that but boy i mean it's an exhausting way to live
 	
 	
 		it really is
 	
 	
 		we are very use to throwing things out there's no question about it and
 	
 	
 		yeah i i've started saving like you said the plastic knives and forks and things
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i save all the little condiments and things and i
 	
 	
 		yeah right exactly exactly lots of little uh soya <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sauces</ENAMEX> and ketchups all over the place
 	
 	
 		yeah things that i normally threw out because they just give you ton and now i've got a big basket full in the refrigerator
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that's right that's right well now i've gotten to where i say don't put any of that in  because it just leaves me with having to dispose of it
 	
 	
 		exactly they'll say do you want any no i do not
 	
 	
 		no please no
 	
 	
 		but i i try and we have a lot of of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazines</ENAMEX> and things like that but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that's
 	
 	
 		and that's hard to get rid of unless you've got there's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">place</ENAMEX> here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> that will take the slicks and all your junk mail and
 		cereal boxes and everything but you have to drive it downtown and so you know my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen</ENAMEX> i mean certainly i don't like anyone to ever come in because i've just got this stuff everywhere i don't drive it <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX> so i've got just piles of it
 	
 	
 		yeah and i've got a tiny little <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen</ENAMEX> so the option of you know some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> will maybe have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> bins one for your garbage and then i have no room
 	
 	
 		right
 		but but you have to move out of your <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> to have all that yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah i have i have room enough for one garbage can and that it is
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i know and it and it really is hard and and uh i then i'll fill up the back of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>  and i'm driving around with trash in my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> and that well at least maybe it keeps someone from stealing
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know because  they'll think there's nothing in this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> but trash anyway
 	
 	
 		and that's true
