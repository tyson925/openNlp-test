 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay um what does your does your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> do anything about recycling
 	
 	
 		we have been working hard to get a program of recycling going
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		the best we've been able to do is an area that has uh storage bins uh for um bottles and uh plastic
 	
 	
 		um
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> need to drive it there we don't we haven't moved to having uh picked up with the garbage yet
 	
 	
 		right
 		Plano um
 		oh it's probably been i guess i started in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September</TIMEX> um
 		started where they gave every every household a bin that you could do newspapers aluminum uh bottles with code <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one and two</NUMEX> on them
 		and uh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glass</ENAMEX> and uh it has been really really successful um
 		they said that they figured like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty five to thirty</TIMEX> percent participation and it's been like forty <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">five percent</NUMEX> and um they also do um
 		they pick up on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">another day of the week</TIMEX> for um
 		lawn debris that could go in like a big compost
 	
 	
 		here uh they don't take uh lawn debris to the landfill any more
 		we need to load it into <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> and take it to a general site where it gets recycled uh but
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i think they're they're not making it easy for the uh general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> to do it here i mean they they
 		you have to haul everything yourself which can be a mess when it comes to uh yard waste in particular
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 		how big is your community
 	
 	
 		well we've got enough <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> we've got a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about eighty five thousand</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but they're just very reluctant to to get moving the way in which i would like to see them moving
 	
 	
 		um-hum the i yeah that's i i would like to see the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturers</ENAMEX> really uh
 		you know the only thing that they recycle right now is is plastics <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one and two</NUMEX> and i would like to see them recycle either more
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plastics um</ENAMEX> you know up to code <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> whatever it is or see the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturers</ENAMEX> using
 		more of the um
 		uh code <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one and two</NUMEX> that i i mean i don't even know of a place to drop off the other the other ones
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">um</ENAMEX> did did did you tell me that you're recycling newspapers
 	
 	
 		but um
 		we're recycling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX> aluminum
 		um i mean like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aluminum</ENAMEX> cans like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">soup</ENAMEX> cans and all that not just you know soda pop <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cans um glass</ENAMEX> and uh the plastics
 	
 	
 		boy you're you're further ahead here most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are recycling <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aluminum soda</ENAMEX> pop and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beer</ENAMEX> cans
 		uh for the money that they get out of them and that seems to be the only incentive on that side
 	
 	
 		right
 		it sure does take a lot of lot of cans to do that that to make anything though at least down here it
 		i i took like <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> garbage sacks full i mean just like paper sacks and got like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a quarter</TIMEX> and i thought this just really isn't worth my time
 	
 	
 		yeah it really is but there are a few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who who
 	
 	
 		so
 		that that go through the dregs yeah
 	
 	
 		they will manage it what we've done at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> is to have uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> bring the stuff to our church
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and then there're couple of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who who crunch them down and then
 		uh take them to a recycling <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> and then the money is used for uh the outreach program to provide food
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		that's great
 	
 	
 		and so that has been an incentive uh within uh our our particular church
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> doesn't want and none of the uh recycling
 		places want them because they say that they're it costs them more to recycle than than they get out of them so we're stuck with newspapers
 	
 	
 		yeah really
 		really
 		we we i know uh even before this took place um in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September</TIMEX>
 		the our like our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy scouts</ENAMEX> were doing paper you know paper drives and even when i was younger um i remember having paper drives at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> and um so
 		i know it it seems like for you know a long time the the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> area has been doing some kind of paper recycling i don't know what they did with the papers you know <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty thirty years ago</TIMEX> i'm not sure
 		but i know now i mean we have a lot of um
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stores  Wal-Mart</ENAMEX> is down real big down here and and their their paper sacks that they do are all you know out of recycled paper and we have a lot of lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">companies</ENAMEX>
