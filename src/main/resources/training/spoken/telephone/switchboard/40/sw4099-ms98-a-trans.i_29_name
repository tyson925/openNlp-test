 
     		
 	
 		okay i guess we're talking about exercise huh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		okay
 		yeah yeah well first of all i i have have to ask you how how old you are
 	
 	
 		oh i <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">am twenty seven</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twenty seven</NUMEX> okay yeah well i am quite a bit older than you are  but no i i think exercise is extremely important and i i do exercise on a regular basis
 	
 	
 		
 
 		you do what type of exercise do you do
 	
 	
 		well i do um jazzercise which is an aerobic um
 	
 	
 		oh you do
 	
 	
 		program that are you familiar with it
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		it's uh you know a national <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> and we have a jazzercise <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Plano</ENAMEX> that has classes like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all day</TIMEX> long so you can
 	
 	
 		is that different from aerobics or is it the same thing
 	
 	
 		no it's really it's it's an aerobic routine you you warm up and then you have <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> of aerobic activity starting you know slowly and then working up to uh you know a high heart rate and then you gradually go down again
 	
 	
 		and you do that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		no i only do it  probably <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two or three</NUMEX> times a week
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		the minimum they want you to do is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times a week
 	
 	
 		oh and this is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">club</ENAMEX> or uh do you belong to a group
 	
 	
 		well it's really a
 		i mean it's called a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> and you buy <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as many</NUMEX> classes as you want to a time and then you just go in whenever you can
 		so like i usually choose to go at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">nine thirty in the morning</TIMEX> or a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fifteen class</ENAMEX> or a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten thirty</TIMEX> class in the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">mornings</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		do you go with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> or do you go alone
 	
 	
 		no i go by myself and and that's one of the frustrating things cause i can find very few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to go with me
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and most of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> that are my age don't exercise or they might play <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">tennis</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and since i am not a <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">tennis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">player</ENAMEX> um you know i don't get that but i am you know i am between i am in my late forties so um there aren't many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> you know that want to do that most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that are in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX> are young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		oh
 	
 	
 		you know with with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between the ages</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh yeah  young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> or yeah
 	
 	
 		young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> you know young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> with with small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> are the ones that i find well what do you do
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		uh i really don't have a routine i like playing <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">basketball</ENAMEX> we just bought a new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> with a <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">basketball</ENAMEX> hoop and that's what i do everyday
 	
 	
 		oh great
 		yeah so you play everyday
 	
 	
 		yeah pretty much when my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> let's me
 	
 	
 		well now who do you play with do you have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> that play with you or just
 		you know
 	
 	
 		no i just shoot around by myself
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh that's about it i use to play <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">soccer</ENAMEX> a lot in high school but when i graduated i haven't done much i don't have a problem i know i have to do more aerobics but i don't have a problem with weight i could eat <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all day</TIMEX> and not gain an ounce
 	
 	
 		well see that's that's that's really good and i think that keeps a lot some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> from exercising
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i mean i don't have a problem with weight either but i think i don't have a problem because i exercise you know i mean <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are always saying to me how do you stay thin and it's because i exercise but i also watch what i eat
 	
 	
 		you do exercises
 		you do exercise
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know but you'll come being being <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty seven</TIMEX> you don't really have to worry about your heart rate and that yet but as you get older you will
 	
 	
 		yeah and i
 		well everyone's told me my waist line is going to expand one of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these days</TIMEX> but
 		i don't know
 	
 	
 		well it might not  it might not because everybody's been telling me that too and so far it hasn't happened you know and i
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i just feel like you know you have to constantly weigh yourself
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and just keep an eye on it and cut back if it starts to get you know too high
 	
 	
 		yeah i guess i enjoy sports a lot so that's why i've kept active in that way
 	
 	
 		yeah but you don't play any other sports but basketball
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">uh basketball</ENAMEX> volleyball um
 		just about it just not really heavy just as far as recreation or hobby i do that
 	
 	
 		but do you ski being in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Utah</ENAMEX> i was wondering if you skied
 	
 	
 		um i used to but it got too expensive so
 	
 	
 		oh did it really
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		because i know that skiing in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Utah</ENAMEX> is is suppose to be great
 	
 	
 		yeah a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> do that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and but well i just i never find the time i had rather do other things
 	
 	
 		yeah well i have never skied before but i have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> that go to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Utah</ENAMEX> all the time and they think it's really and they ski i guess there's a place where you can ski where was it <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tahoe</ENAMEX> where you ski from
 	
 	
 		oh they come up here
 	
 	
 		no that's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nevada</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> i guess yeah i am thinking about where you can ski over the state line
 	
 	
 		that's in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nevada</ENAMEX> uh-huh
 		oh yeah but
 	
 	
 		but there's a funny there is a place in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Utah</ENAMEX> called a funny name
 	
 	
 		there's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Snow Bird</ENAMEX> or Alta
 	
 	
 		but it's like oh <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Heavenly</ENAMEX> is that it
 	
 	
 		Heavenly
 	
 	
 		yeah i think it's called Heavenly
 	
 	
 		huh i've never heard of that one huh-uh
 	
 	
 		you've never heard of that
 		well maybe it isn't in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Utah</ENAMEX> i don't know
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but they said they've skied <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heavenly</ENAMEX> and  it sounded like you know that they skied really well and when they are actually talking about a place it was kind of funny
 	
 	
 		do they exercise much or i mean for skiing i know when i went you can get sore easily but
 	
 	
 		oh yeah you can get really sore i know you i can mean i've talked to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> but most of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> ski enough so that they don't get sore
 	
 	
 		oh yeah see i'm this one or two timer a year if i do go and i am really sore after
 	
 	
 		and
 		and then is it your your quadriceps that are this worst you mean your legs and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		my legs really really ache
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but that's i am using muscles that i have never used before
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well and it's strange that like you can do like i did aerobics you know all the time and then i went horseback riding
 		and still i was so sore and i couldn't get over
