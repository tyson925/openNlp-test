 
     		
 	
 		so um do you have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> of your own
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yes
 	
 	
 		uh how old are they
 	
 	
 		they range in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twenty four</NUMEX> down to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		ah so have you had to deal with this uh child care question yourself
 	
 	
 		not not really my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> has provided the child care up to now
 	
 	
 		uh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		uh that certainly is the most straightforward
 	
 	
 		that's the easiest one
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		do you have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i do i have uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> who will be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX> and uh we're expecting another in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		and have you been into child care
 	
 	
 		no not yet although my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> stays <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> also uh we're starting to look into maybe a preschool
 		<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a couple of hours</TIMEX> a day for the older <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> next year
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh
 		just to give him a little more time with other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> and to give my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> a little more time with the the baby
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh but otherwise i i mean even just looking for that has been kind of difficult finding one that you really like and that doesn't have some uh
 		major disadvantages
 	
 	
 		well i think one of the things you kind of have to do is decide what you want out of day care or out of preschool you know do you want a real academic one or do you want one that's more for socialization purposes
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh you know i i think those are some sort of critical issues we see a lot i see a lot of programs that are really geared to get the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> ready for school and i see others that are sort of more oriented towards fun for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yes that's true that's true uh
 		and i would tend to lean toward the fun at this age
 	
 	
 		me too  the last thing they need at that age is academics
 	
 	
 		yeah i mean they'll get it eventually anyhow uh how how old are your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> when they started some sort of school
 	
 	
 		well we generally with most of our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> there were well with our oldest one they didn't have kindergarten in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and so we sent her to a private kindergarten and that was really her first exposure
 	
 	
 		um
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		with the others we've either
 		with some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> done a
 		a sort of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mother</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Day</ENAMEX> out kind of thing where they took turns
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of times a week</TIMEX> or we've actually put them into a little preschool at about age <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> just for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX>'s kind of socialization and again to give my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> a little bit of relief
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah it sounds like we'll be doing something similar and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> was thinking of uh starting up a little preschool
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		maybe just with a few other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> and it would be sort of a mom it would end up being a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mom</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX> off thing because they would take turns
 		um
 	
 	
 		we did that until our very last <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> and then my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> kind of said you know i'm ready for a break
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh so that's quite a spread <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty four to five</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh we have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> so
 	
 	
 		wow that's great
 	
 	
 		there's a lot of space in between i mean there's not an awful lot of space in between them
 	
 	
 		um
 		so did now the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty four year old</TIMEX> was was nineteen when the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five year old</TIMEX> was born has she been at home
 	
 	
 		uh she was in college actually when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> was born
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		what kind of what's their relationship like
 	
 	
 		very good
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		it would be
 		very interesting i mean old enough i mean really
 		no sibling rivalry there i would expect
 	
 	
 		no and she kind of really wanted him  i mean she wanted us to have him so she was real excited about it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh she has a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> of her own now that's just <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of years</TIMEX> younger than he is
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i always had <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> who had an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">uncle</ENAMEX>
 		uh
 		hold it no that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> is
 		wait a minute this should be very simple
 	
 	
 		my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> is a
 	
 	
 		that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> is your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nephew</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah right
 	
 	
 		that's right yeah i always had <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> who had an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">uncle</ENAMEX> who was a year younger or the same age and i always thought that was neat
 	
 	
 		well we didn't quite make that but came close so it doesn't
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh but they were pretty close at least compared to me and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">uncle</ENAMEX>  whose <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about forty</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> older
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um
 		um
 		do you plan to have more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		all said
 		um
 	
 	
 		now we've we're into the grand type <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> period now that's much better
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i would think that would have a lot of rewards does your does your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> live nearby
 	
 	
 		they live about uh
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> from here they're in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Antonio</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh well
 		well that's accessible for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a weekend</TIMEX> um does she have to worry about child care
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh no right now she's staying home taking care of her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> or her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> is in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> still
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh so she works a little night job to help him through school and he stays home and takes care of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the evening</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh it sounds great
 	
 	
 		so they've been able to work that out so far she doesn't wanna go back to work if she can avoid it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah yeah i wish i could stay home with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and me too
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um
 		but it is nice to i mean i i find it
 		it really gives me peace of mind to know that my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> is home
 		with our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> you know as as far as knowing what kind of care he's getting
 	
 	
 		i don't know what you hear in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> but you know there's a lot of
