 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so uh
 		does your <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> do any sort of drug testing
 	
 	
 		yeah they do do random drug testing i i work in the defense industry
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and so they're they're they're pretty concerned about something like that although in my mind i don't
 		i don't like the idea of having a having like a hit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">squad</ENAMEX> come in
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and suddenly like you know put my employment on the line over uh my lifestyle choices considered
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i i don't think considering i don't think it affects my job and like nobody um
 		nobody's life is at at risk i don't think they should really care what i do in my spare time
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		so what are they worried about are they worried about
 		i mean do you is this a secure environment you're in
 	
 	
 		i think i'm not i'm not really sure i think that they're worried that you might uh
 		if if if you're a drug <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">addict</ENAMEX> you could probably compromise government secrets or something like that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but i i think it's a pretty conservative approach to you know uh
 		uh things i think it's like a fifties approach to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a to a an an eighties or nineties</NUMEX> lifestyle
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know i i don't know i think <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> are pretty pervasive in our society
 	
 	
 		uh yeah and not to mention the legal ones which they don't even care about
 	
 	
 		
 
 		and yeah well also i what i think is a a problem is that there's a there's a lot of things out there that will actually make let you test positive for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> when you're you're not even
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		like not even on drugs
 	
 	
 		right and you'll be penalized
 		i mean you could lose your job very easily
 	
 	
 		right
 		i did you see that thing on uh <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">60 Minutes</ENAMEX> about the uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot</ENAMEX> who um they there was a mistake at the lab
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		and oh it was on in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">60 Minutes</ENAMEX> there was a mistake at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lab</ENAMEX> and he he tested he was a B fifty <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> bomber pilot
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		and he he tested positive and he it ruined his career he
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		he uh he was drummed out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX> and he spent i think something like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven years</TIMEX> working you know before he was able to work his way back through the the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX> to be uh
 		you know i guess it's called exonerated
 	
 	
 		i guess so right
 	
 	
 		but by then his career is was was ruined because
 	
 	
 		oh yes his life is over at that point
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		he's he he was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven years</TIMEX> and it was just like it it was a an accident
 	
 	
 		yeah i've read things that talk about the number of false or negatives
 	
 	
 		and
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		to the number of false positives and you know the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> you're going to hurt
 		while accomplishing you know whatever you think you're accomplishing is really quite high
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh you know but i but i also uh you know you read things about uh like <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train car</ENAMEX> conductors
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh  which you think of the
 	
 	
 		you  like the ticket takers
 	
 	
 		well no i'm talking about like the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> no i'm i'm talking about the the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineers</ENAMEX> now that that is pretty scary though
 	
 	
 		engineer
 		
 
 		it is the only thing is i my what i think is they they're testing for
 		you know especially illegal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> is part of the real problem the real problem is you want to make sure this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> is on the ball
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i think that what they should be doing is performance testing
 		not drug testing you know they should have some sort of video game or something
 		that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> has to play or you know something like that because if he you know maybe he didn't get any sleep <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the night</TIMEX> before
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh just stayed up too late and for that reason is not on the ball or he's
 		you know he he's unhappy about something or he's sick
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		or uh
 		you know uh using some legal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> that they don't test for i mean i really don't want to be i don't want to die in a train wreck
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and and it's because i don't want to die that i want them to do a more meaningful test
 	
 	
 		yeah but then again uh you know i also if i was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conductor</ENAMEX> i i i wouldn't want
 		i wouldn't want to have to like you know piss in a little paper cup whenever  you know
 	
 	
 		well i can see there be yeah i actually it's some some mixed mixed feeling about feel i mean i feel like okay if you're going to do testing do a meaningful test like a performance test
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh
 		the testing itself uh i could see where the testing if it's not if it is a performance test i mean it's directly related doing your job
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh it has nothing to do with your personal you know lifestyle uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		by then i had just had a thought about like what about a what about a police <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> you know
 	
 	
 		
  
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i mean that then you begin to to wonder if i understand they have like random
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		law enforcement <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> have to go through through random random tests just to see i guess like what side of the law they are they're on
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know and  and i'm beginning i'm i'm starting to think a little more a little more about this is that i guess should we really be talking about  what should we be should we have legalized drugs
 		you know
 	
 	
 		well a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> say that that would
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		simplify a lot of things uh i tend to
 		i tend to agree just because the attempts to make certain things illegal were such flops
 	
 	
 		yeah i i think that uh
