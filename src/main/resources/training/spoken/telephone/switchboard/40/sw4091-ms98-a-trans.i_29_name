 
     		
 	
 		i guess that starts it um
 	
 	
 		
 
 		all right go
 	
 	
 		so um i guess right now what's most important for me uh doing is coming up is we have a really good stock program
 		uh where i work and it's gonna give me about a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three hundred</NUMEX> percent return
 		this time around on my uh investment
 	
 	
 		good
 	
 	
 		which is definitely helping since i'm gonna buy a house
 	
 	
 		is what do they what do they give you stock in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> you work for
 	
 	
 		yeah what they do is what they do is it's it's a purchase program
 		where you get the stock it's it's it's on a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one year</TIMEX> cycle and you get it at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eighty five</NUMEX> percent of the lower of the beginning and the end price for the year
 		so like the the set price at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the beginning of the year last May</TIMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five sixty four</NUMEX> a share
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		stocks trading <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about fourteen</TIMEX> now
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		so and you so i'll get to buy it at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five sixty four four</NUMEX> and turn around the same day
 		the only down side is they do it as a withholding off your uh income so you got to kind of you know be willing to squirrel away at whatever you wanna do
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah that sounds good
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		what <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> is that
 	
 	
 		that's with Interleaf
 	
 	
 		excuse me
 	
 	
 		Interleaf
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Interleaf</ENAMEX> never heard of it
 	
 	
 		uh desktop publishing
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		so
 		but um you know
 	
 	
 		yeah what are we supposed to talk about salaries  benefits besides salary is that
 	
 	
 		yeah benefits other than salary
 	
 	
 		yeah but i i get a i get a pretty good i work for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">City of New York</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i get a pretty good um health plan
 		and
 	
 	
 		yeah but that that's definitely a good thing to have  especially these days
 	
 	
 		yeah the health plan's pretty good and and we get um they also have a deferred compensation plan which is similar to what you're talking about where they'll they'll take out money tax free from your income and invest it
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and it's a group investment so you i think you also save fees
 	
 	
 		what is what is that like a uh like a  uh  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TIACREF</ENAMEX> type thing
 	
 	
 		it's like a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">401K</TIMEX> plan except they don't they don't contribute
 	
 	
 		okay yeah  so it's for retirement
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		yeah so you you have to wait until like  fifty <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> or
 	
 	
 		yeah i think i think you can take out the money anytime you want but you'll pay you'll pay taxes on it and you're better off waiting until you retire when you are probably going to have less income or some something like that
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah we we we've got a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">401K</NUMEX> here
 		but um i chose to go into the stock program because you can't lose on it and you know i can always take the money off of that if i wasn't saving up for the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> i would be putting money into a 401K
 		but you know i'd much rather get the eighteen eighteen percent minimum return on the stock and use that for the house
 	
 	
 		yeah uh
 	
 	
 		but yeah you know medical medical is good you know we get a good program here what's basically <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred</NUMEX> percent coverage for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about twenty</TIMEX> bucks a month
 	
 	
 		wow that's that's really good
 	
 	
 		it's like your yeah it is it's a very good <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> as far as benefits go they've got 401K's they've got uh
 		the health coverage they've got you know the stock program they've got uh 125K selling it for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty</TIMEX> bucks they do put it in the dental you know dental is like you know eighty or fifty percent depending on what you're doing
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">um</ENAMEX> and you know you <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 125K</TIMEX> means i can pay that piece out of pre tax money rather than post tax
 		the only problem with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">125K</ENAMEX> is you got to say at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the beginning of the year</TIMEX> i think i'm gonna have a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">thousand dollars</NUMEX> of expenses <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> and then you have to be willing to have that money deducted from your salary and if you don't use the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">thousand dollars</NUMEX> it goes away
 	
 	
 		if you own oh okay i see
 	
 	
 		so at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the year</TIMEX> if you haven't used it all up it's you know the feds take it or or whoever takes it it just disappears
 		but you know if if you know you know so you wanna underestimate a little bit so like you know i know i easily have a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">thousand dollars</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">five hundred dollars</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> of dental and and miscellaneous miscellaneous medical and deductibles
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		so i just have them pull you know <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five hundred</NUMEX> it means i pay like you know as opposed to paying like you know <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">eight hundred dollars</NUMEX> i pay or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five hundred</NUMEX> i pay like <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three hundred</NUMEX> because it's on pre tax
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">hello</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm here
 	
 	
 		yeah it uh it was a width away that's why it's it's every time i talk it sounds weird but uh yeah there's there's other benefits too noneconomic i mean there's there's uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		there's benefits just in working for a big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> i think in in that you have a lot of uh different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> doing a lot of different things and
 	
 	
 		yeah i i think it it depends how flat the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> is if you know  hang on my computer is talking to me um you know it depends how flat it is if it's um
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		i don't like working in an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> where you're really deep in the tree
 		because then you start to feel like you've got no real you know power to change anything
 	
 	
 		right well that's working for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> is somewhat like that except for my unit you know i have control over what goes on in my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> and and just that
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		um but what i mean is i i say for instance i'm an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> uh a collection <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">City of New York</ENAMEX> and and in the environmental control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i'm i've learned so much about computer systems and sharing of information all these managerial type things that i never thought i'd be involved with and if i was in private practice i'd never be able to learn all that stuff
 	
 	
 		yeah but there's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sides</ENAMEX> to that because also you know i've seen a lot of i knew somebody who worked for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Digital</ENAMEX> and for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</TIMEX> he worked on like you know the tape <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">driver</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> tape drive and that's all he did
