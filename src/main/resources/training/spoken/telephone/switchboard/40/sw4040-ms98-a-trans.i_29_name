 
     		
 	
 		uh hello <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">hello</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh you were going to talk about child care
 	
 	
 		yeah uh
 		we well me and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> we got a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five year old</TIMEX> and we have
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh
 		kind of like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> rearing he we have problems with him <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every now and then</TIMEX> but other than that it's it's pretty he's a pretty good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and we uh really don't really have any problem with finding day care for him because i'm in the service and we just take him to the day care on base
 	
 	
 		i see how much how much do they charge
 	
 	
 		they charge <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about forty five dollars</NUMEX> a week
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh</ENAMEX> that seems relatively low by commercial standards isn't it usually about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixty</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred</NUMEX> a week
 	
 	
 		um yeah it's it's pretty pretty expensive on the outside
 	
 	
 		right um so you've you've been you've been pleased with the service
 	
 	
 		oh yeah they do a lot of you know lot of stuff in in their day care and stuff
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		uh how long have you been taking your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> there
 	
 	
 		oh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about a year</TIMEX> now
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh</ENAMEX> before that did he go somewhere else or
 	
 	
 		well before that my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> was kind of stay at home <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mom</ENAMEX> now she went back to school so
 	
 	
 		i see
 		you say you went back to school
 	
 	
 		no the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> went back to school
 	
 	
 		oh i see uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so he's been there for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">almost a year</TIMEX> now
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		um gee i think   where where does she go to school
 	
 	
 		she goes to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UT</ENAMEX> uh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arlington</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh-huh okay yeah i had a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> who went there at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time
 		but i think we're getting off the topic so
 	
 	
 		yeah uh
 	
 	
 		so um  let's see i mean i i was uh reading i read a lot of articles on child care back when it was when there was a debate in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> over funding of uh child care <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> and what should be done
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i came out uh very much in favor of a tax credit approach where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> would be given a tax credit and they would select whatever services they wanted for their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> rather than to have the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> subsidize certain providers
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh that was i i thought it was important well i mean it is important uh that that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have the opportunity to select the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">service</ENAMEX> that they would choose
 		because a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> are in you know in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> well well not really centers but they're being cared for by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> and uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh that's the sort of they they prefer it that way the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> do because they know the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who are caring for their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> and they don't have to take them very far
 		plus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about a third</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> are in church run <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> and there was a big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> state controversy over whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> could
 		fund those are not i think they ultimately decided to but they placed a lot of restrictions on it so it wasn't clear that the church child care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> would want to go to the trouble
 	
 	
 		um yeah
 	
 	
 		so uh anyway  i continue to be an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocate</ENAMEX> of the um of the tax credit approach now myself i'm not married so i don't have any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> and it's not a problem but uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		still i know a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that do and uh you know i mean you you you really wouldn't wouldn't um uh well i'm on
 		gee i'm on the benefits <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committee</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">university</ENAMEX> here and uh child care is a topic of conversation we the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">university</ENAMEX> started up a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> but it's <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about two miles</NUMEX> away from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">campus</ENAMEX> and i'm not sure it's going to be real convenient for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to take their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> over there
 	
 	
 		yeah well well when i was stationed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lubbock Texas</ENAMEX> uh they had a child care <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> right on base uh right at the school i mean
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and that helped out my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> because she just went part time there and you know take a couple of classes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a week</TIMEX> but
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		right uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh i think it's a good deal deal but um like you were saying it's <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about two miles</NUMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> and that's
 	
 	
 		yeah it's just a lot of time
 	
 	
 		it's not going to be very good i think they should talk about putting <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> right on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">campus</ENAMEX> itself
 	
 	
 		yeah well they say they claim that it's a better environment for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> than to be in with all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		well they kind of have this i think in a different building you know on right on the
 		uh edge of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">campus</ENAMEX> and everything where they really didn't get in
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 		yeah i am sure that a lot of it had to do with how cheap it was to acquire the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> if they would've built a new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> then it would've i'm i'm sure it would have cost a lot more than if they uh if they put it down where they did where real estate's probably cheaper
 	
 	
 		in
 		oh yeah um i think they used one of the existing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> they already had
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so you know it it worked out pretty good
 	
 	
 		so so so what do you think about the about the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> about the tax credit versus the subsidy approach which seems seems most appealing to you
 	
 	
 		uh
 		well i haven't really thought about it like that
 		
 
 		because well you know we pay
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i think
 		well the
 	
 	
 		excuse me we pay for any you know the child care but we don't pay as much as they do off base
 	
 	
 		that's right yeah
 	
 	
 		uh i think the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> should subsidize some of it you know
 		to give the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> you know some break on on the money portion of it
 	
 	
 		well i mean they they yeah the issue the issue is whether they can take it off of their taxes or whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> decides which centers are qualified the other problem
