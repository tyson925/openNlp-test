 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i guess my basic feeling is that
 		as a middle income tax <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">payer</ENAMEX> i'm not paying too much if i'm sure that i'm getting value for the dollar i mean that i guess sounds like a cliche but
 		uh looking around at a a lot of the infrastructure particularly in the northeast here uh you know <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridges</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX> in terrible shape and
 		i don't know  i'm sort of overwhelmed by it all
 	
 	
 		do you think that that's because the uh
 		because the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> have been seduced by the opportunity to get the vote
 		uh so they've spent the money on
 		on uh popular how should i say it programs that show up immediately you know like giving away uh
 		uh let's see how shall i say it
 		paying money to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that that uh
 		
 
 		uh
 		it it takes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> for a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX> to begin to show neglect uh whereas a temporary uh
 		
 
 		uh input of money can uh
 		which they can never turn off by the way will get this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> votes
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah it's entirely possible certainly anything that's been
 		discussed over the the last <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dozen</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years or so</TIMEX> or maybe even longer in terms of of tax reform or or revenue reallocation
 		seems to be concerned with just that you know who's who's gonna start getting more and how fast um i kind of came of age in the
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sixties</ENAMEX> and it seemed to me seems to me that the the general attitude in the
 		entire <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> is a lot different then than now i mean i think there was more a a general sense of prosperity
 	
 	
 		there was
 	
 	
 		yeah although
 		my
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		oh excuse me
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i was just going to say there's significantly more money
 		and we weren't a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">debtor nation</ENAMEX> in those days
 	
 	
 		yeah i i've never been able to reconcile that fact which which does seem to be true with the fact that the typical middle class family
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> seems to have you know and expect some what more in terms of material possessions and vacations and what not
 		but back then uh i think there is more of a sense of because there was a feeling of prosperity <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> did not mind paying for social programs
 		for instance or public improvements and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> there
 		there seems to be a sort of a jealous guarding by each generation
 	
 	
 		well
 		i think <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> things have happened number one
 		uh
 		it's like uh
 		
 
 		pay play now pay later uh somebody's we're we're to the point now where
 		where the pay later is uh is here and  and uh
 		when i was growing up they always warned me against borrowing money to go on a vacation because you have <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all year long</TIMEX> to think about those payments
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and it just goes by pretty fast well the play now pay later uh
 		mentality uh sounded pretty good at the time when you when you had a fair amount of disposable income and uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um
 		the the debt load is way up uh
 		you know in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the sixties</TIMEX>
 		what was the cost of tuition the cost of tuition in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">those days</TIMEX> was
 		was the cost of uh almost <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</TIMEX> rent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> right
 		i don't
 	
 	
 		yeah pretty much i mean i i paid whatever something on the order of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">four thousand dollars</NUMEX> a year for
 		tuition and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> and comprehensive fee and uh for those those figures have been dwarfed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> certainly
 	
 	
 		yeah i mean well i'm not saying <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</TIMEX> rent is <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">four thousand dollars</NUMEX> but but tuition uh i bet tuition was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about a third</NUMEX> of that uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know perhaps anyway what i'm saying is that everything costs more these days uh and we've reached a point where
 		where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are like i say taxes are going up uh your expenses have gone up and the perhaps the thing that's more important uh
 		uh
 		progressive we are now making what uh what we used to think of as only the rich made
 		you know the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> the minimum wage is  let's see what is it when i was a  i'm
 		i graduated from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">college</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixty one</TIMEX> and i can remember when i graduated i  hoped someday to make eighteen <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">thousand dollars</NUMEX> a year
 		and taxes on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eighteen thousand a year</TIMEX> uh were a whole lot less than uh
 		you know taxes on what what i thought was a very good salary
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um
 		are about the same as they are <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> only i'm making
