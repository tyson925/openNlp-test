 
     		
 	
 		well we in our <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> seems to be involved a lot in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mid East</ENAMEX> what do you what do you think
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well yeah i uh
 		and i'm i'm sure there's things going on that that uh we don't know about but but uh it
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year a year ago</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">now</TIMEX> when the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the war</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Desert Storm</ENAMEX> was finishing up seems like things were uh
 		going to settle down and nothing seems to of seems to have settled down after all
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		it that that happens a lot doesn't it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		wars don't usually settle things  much
 	
 	
 		yeah right
 	
 	
 		um um and i i guess i i feel like we
 		we keep getting into <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">places</ENAMEX> without really understanding what we're doing
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh which really i find upsetting because it seems like we've got experts
 		and we've got <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who understand these cultures but i always wonder if they're really used because it seems like then afterwards we have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> explaining to us how if they'd only known such and such
 		we wouldn't have done this you know
 	
 	
 		yeah and and i i think there's a
 	
 	
 		and would
 	
 	
 		yeah i i i i have very much doubt that
 		that there's a real understanding at the top levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">of the</ENAMEX> of the cultures and of what's going on
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		in terms of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">and</ENAMEX> and it seems to me that our policy basically seems to be uh the enemy of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enemy</ENAMEX> is my friend
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		and that that
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX> was uh was our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buddy buddy</ENAMEX> as long as he was against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> was our bigger <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enemy</ENAMEX> and then  when it turns out that uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		but <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> of course used to be our friend
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i mean we can't it's a little hard to keep it straight isn't it
 	
 	
 		and
 		right oh yes yes and when we decided <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX> was our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enemy</ENAMEX> then the uh uh
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		oh what's his name in uh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Syria</ENAMEX> uh
 	
 	
 		yeah um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh Hafaia Susaad</ENAMEX> i believe uh is suddenly our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> even though he was he was on our our leading terrorist yeah our leading terrorist list so uh
 	
 	
 		right
 		on hit our really bad list
 	
 	
 		you know and
 	
 	
 		and i i i keep reading about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jordan</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hussein</ENAMEX> and i just feel so sorry for him sort of in the middle of all of this trying to keep some sort of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sanity</ENAMEX> living vulnerable right where he is
 	
 	
 		right
 		right right and and uh
 		i think we're trying to we're trying to extricate ourselves somewhat from being
 		so definitely tied to to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli</ENAMEX> side in terms of all of that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli</ENAMEX> versus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arab</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		right yes yes right
 		right
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		i haven't seen uh solid evidence yet that we're doing a really good job of that  yeah yeah so
 	
 	
 		of doing that either no  no i i i i just get a sense of our
 		walking in over and over and over again in places where we weren't well versed or something
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 	
 	
 		didn't didn't know what we were doing so i mean it just feels unprepared or
 	
 	
 		right and
 	
 	
 		something and and if we could it's not wise that i guess i'm still looking for a statesman
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		you know someone who really the the the kind of stories you hear about or you look back in history these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> really understood what they're doing and did this wise thing every once in a while
 		and i just keep thinking i know there with all the resources we have there must be <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who could have explained some of this and said if you do this subtle thing understanding their culture <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et cetera et</ENAMEX> cetera it'll have this effect but
 	
 	
 		yeah well it it
 		from what yeah from what little i heard in terms the the the most understanding
 		to get really cynical about it the most understanding uh
 		i uh felt that was displayed in terms of of uh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> in particular
 		was that it seemed to me that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Bush</ENAMEX> was was trying to play the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peacemaker</ENAMEX> in such a way that
 		that he was guaranteeing that given their culture that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX> could not back down and would not could not do anything but go to war
 	
 	
 		oh absolutely yes
 	
 	
 		and that uh
 	
 	
 		i mean which which was uh in the line of business that i'm in which is mediation
 	
 	
 		uh oh boy
 	
 	
 		every absolutely everything he did i mean i was in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">classrooms</ENAMEX> teaching <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> about how to do negotiating and mediating and every single thing we did was against every principle i was teaching it was like
 		um
 	
 	
 		oh that must have been that yes that must have been really fascinating fascinating watching
 	
 	
 		yes
 		it was emotionally quite difficult uh to say the least because it's sort of like
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		golly gee this is a set up for absolutely the worst chance
 		possible what are what are we doing here you back someone in the corner is it too surprising if they come out fighting
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right
 	
 	
 		i mean uh ah didn't you ever see that with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> i mean don't
 	
 	
 		right
 		yes
 		yes
 	
 	
 		i i saw did see one of the peace rallies where they just said  i can't remember the exact thing it was
 		something like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Saddam Saddam</ENAMEX> go home
