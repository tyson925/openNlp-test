 
     		
 	
 		so how do you get most of your current event information
 	
 	
 		well during see i'm going to school right now and uh while i'm working i don't get a i don't get a chance to read the paper a lot
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i don't watch TV as much really either because uh my free time is kind of and i do like to do other stuff with it while i'm at work sometimes i on the computer network um
 	
 	
 		right
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i read the news sometimes and that's kind of helpful
 	
 	
 		i would imagine going to college though your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professors</ENAMEX> and different things you keep up on what's going on
 	
 	
 		that's true i mean my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">roommates</ENAMEX> and stuff you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> around me talk about it and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> i work with are pretty you know up up-to-date on that kind of stuff so
 	
 	
 		right well i'm a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">housewife</ENAMEX> i have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> and so um i get most of my information probably through just the news at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">six o'clock</TIMEX> and then um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		talking with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and just hearing what's going on but
 	
 	
 		do you watch do you watch the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> like major network news or do you watch like the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McNeil Lehrer Hour</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		just the regular channel just channel <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> that's our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> here that's the um eyewitness news
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		uh-huh oh channel see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> where i am channel <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eight</TIMEX>'s um like public TV so it's kind of different
 	
 	
 		so
 		oh uh-huh yeah
 	
 	
 		i think i think the uh
 		i think a lot of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commentators</ENAMEX> on like the major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> like right it's kind of appropriate right now because of the election stuff going on but um it seems that um
 		they kind of get to throw their opinions into how they you know report on the news
 	
 	
 		right and i think even in the elections they choose who they're going to follow and who they're not and basically you know if a candidate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> can get them to follow then the news will
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know kind of publicize his name
 	
 	
 		yeah exactly
 	
 	
 		i don't think that the way i get the news is the right way to get it i think you get a very lopsided picture of what's going on
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh uh</ENAMEX> because they can they can only report on i mean they give each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> perhaps you know ten <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> blurbs in which to you know to say
 		you you just can't get a full picture of you know their message unless you have time to sit down and read and probably read something on it
 	
 	
 		right
 		right and the news too it just doesn't um cover all that many stories i mean it just covers your basic you know violent crimes
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and you know and and your catastrophes catastrophes with weather and stuff but other than that you really don't know what's going on
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um i will read our current letters that come out on elections and i guess i do read that and i do study who's running in our area and i do study what's going on in the economy
 		it you know and i guess i do read other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazines</ENAMEX> um too to get my information
 	
 	
 		what kind of uh see i subscribe to like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Science News</ENAMEX> and that's that's real good because it gives like a brief summary of all like the updates like of what's going on in science without getting into a lot of detail that would you know bog me down that i wouldn't know about
 	
 	
 		right i
 	
 	
 		but other than that i don't really read i don't i don't really subscribe to anything else
 	
 	
 		i used to read <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every month</TIMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reader's Digest</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but um now i guess i just have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> that clip articles or if i you know am interested in something of course during the war when we were in war i read up on that just a little in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX> to find out what was going on but a lot of the times
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		i you know i wish i had the time to read all the stories in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX> but i just can't seem to find the time if they'd put it out in a video or on  not a video but a cassette tape or something where you could just listen to it i would do that while i was doing other things
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but
 	
 	
 		well i remember during back during the uh during the war everyone here at work always had the radio or the TV on because that they were going constantly with that stuff
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well i um they even did a story on our news here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> on what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> wanted to see more of and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> said that they wanted to see more on
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		outside of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> news you know we just don't want to hear every <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> all the killings that went on here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that we want to hear what's going on with the economy what's being done to help it what's going on in other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> what's you know just more information
 	
 	
 		if they reported <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every</TIMEX> murder if they reported every violent crime in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Atlanta</ENAMEX> it would take it would probably take the whole news hour but uh
 	
 	
 		yeah well i guess you'll get pretty good news coverage in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of years</TIMEX> when you host the uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Olympics</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh yeah that's they still already they're having like um in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX> they have a section i think every <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">now and then</TIMEX> on on the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Olympics</ENAMEX> you know and they've got like a countdown it's like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixteen hundred days</TIMEX> or something
 	
 	
 		i know we're trying to get tickets to it right now yeah
 	
 	
 		oh really that's gonna be crazy <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that time of year</TIMEX> here but uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i can't believe i mean they're they're uh stretching out the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Olympic</ENAMEX> news for that much coverage over
 		i guess <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> want to hear about it also big in big in the news right now is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Braves</ENAMEX> because they're uh they're in you know training spring training or whatever and they did so well last year
 	
 	
 		right right yeah they spent a lot of time that's another thing they spend <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a long time</TIMEX> on sports and i think that um that's fine i would like to see more time spent on other things but
 	
 	
 		yeah it seems like
 		i don't know it's they way they do the newscasts uh i wish they they kind of separated it you know or if you wanted to watch one thing you could turn to some some channel for it but i don't have cable
