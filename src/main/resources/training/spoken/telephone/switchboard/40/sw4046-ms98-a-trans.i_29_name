 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so have you had to think about uh
 		nursing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> and the elderly that sort of thing in your own life
 	
 	
 		nah not really my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> are still pretty young my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">forty five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> about the same age
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh that's very young
 	
 	
 		yeah um
 		so that really hasn't been an issue for me
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		how about yourself
 	
 	
 		uh no my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> are getting older my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> is uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seventy</TIMEX> and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> must be about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixty</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so i'm starting to think about it but i haven't had to do anything about it yet uh my grand
 	
 	
 		right have they got any kind of uh supplemental insurance for that or
 	
 	
 		no i'm pretty sure they don't um they have some income from pensions and social security um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but no i don't think they have any insurance that would cover that sort of thing
 	
 	
 		yeah well i've heard about most of that insurance i was wondering because it seems like what i've heard is usually that the stuff says uh kind of thing where they cancel you <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of years</TIMEX> after you get in into the home
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so it tends to be kind of useless anyway
 	
 	
 		yeah its my impression those costs are so high that without something
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know special you can't handle it anyway uh
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i mean i think we might uh we talk about having them move in with us
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but there are certain health
 		you know certain health conditions that we wouldn't be able to handle and i think we've just sort of avoided thinking about it real hard
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right
 		yeah
 		i don't know it seems to me that for the kind of money a nursing home typically costs you can maybe even afford to
 		to have a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurse</ENAMEX> come into the home periodically
 	
 	
 		that might be a good alternative i mean it is my impressions <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">tens of thousands of dollars</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		dollars <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> at that point yeah it seems like you could hire somebody part time
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah what the heck
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and certainly more dignified than uh
 	
 	
 		yeah its
 	
 	
 		than warehousing them
 	
 	
 		it it it does seem like there are a lot of horror stories out there and
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's it's kind of scary because it seems like uh you know a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> you know it's it's uh the budgets of these places has gotten so tight
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh you know they just really can't take care of them very well the budget and staffing especially if it's a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> run
 	
 	
 		i saw something on <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Sixty Sixty Minutes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few months ago</TIMEX> about nursing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> that was a real you know horror piece
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah it seems like every time i see something on television it's not good
 	
 	
 		yeah so and i guess you know we have to think about gee maybe we have another <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">forty</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> before we'd end up in that sort of situation is it possible we could
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		put away enough money to handle it ourselves
 	
 	
 		yeah it seems that way
 	
 	
 		huh um do you do you have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandparents</ENAMEX> who are left
 	
 	
 		yeah i sure do they're they're pretty healthy everybody in my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> seems to die when they're they're in good health but they get to be like <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">seventy</ENAMEX> or eighty and all have aneurisms just drop dead
 	
 	
 		well that's could be worse i think
 	
 	
 		yeah i think you know that's pretty good way to go
 	
 	
 		if i could live until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seventy</TIMEX> or eighty and have an aneurism and drop dead i'd probably
 	
 	
 		i'd be happy
 	
 	
 		yeah i i think that might be sufficient might be sufficient
 	
 	
 		yeah that's that's the worst part um seems to me that a lot of times <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> wind up in nursing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> who tend to survive major things like <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">strokes</ENAMEX> or uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart attacks</ENAMEX> that sort of thing and then you know they can't really help themselves so they have to be cared for
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah i mean it seems like in a case like that you'd need more help than ever to uh
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		to more more support and some way to live a fulfilling life and it doesn't seem like those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are getting it
 	
 	
 		yeah i mean it seems like they'd be almost just you know better off just withholding care to some some degree
 	
 	
 		well it's always a tough question you know i mean with not only the elderly but sick <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in general you know when do you withhold and when do you not
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		well it seems to me it's a little bit easier with the elderly because you know at least they've lived a life
 	
 	
 		you would think yeah i mean you'd think hey the clock's bound to run out at some point
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		yeah
 		yeah it's something it's something like fifty <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">percent</NUMEX> or greater of all health care expenses are in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last five years</TIMEX> of life
 	
 	
 		yeah um you my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurse</ENAMEX> and she tells me stories about uh
 	
 	
 		so
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		the things that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are put through the so heroic measures they're put through when they're very sick some of them are very old and some aren't that uh
 	
 	
 		right
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		everyone really knows isn't going to make a real difference but they're sort of left not knowing what else to do than everything they can do
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah
 		seems like uh unfortunately that many of those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who are put through those if they'd uh let their wishes be known ahead of time frequently they wouldn't have been interested in heroic measures and
 	
 	
 		yeah my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> has certain certain wishes that she doesn't want certain procedures done and i just hope i can remember what they are  it comes time to deal with it
 	
 	
 		if that's the case then
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 		yeah well i don't know my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>'s a medical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> and uh you know we got some of the uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Journal of the AMA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Medical News</ENAMEX> thing and it seems like that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> unless they're in writing or video tape or something
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		that they're kind of in a
