 
     		
 	
 		okay you wanna start
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah i might as well uh one of the things i'm very concerned about the air pollution is the uh this this the ozone layer uh
 		uh  uh issue uh i used to own a heating and air conditioning business and handled lots of freon different types of freons
 		and it uh rather bothers me that uh i was in in effect uh contributing to the delinquency of the the environment so to speak
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah now that's stuff we never even thought about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three years ago</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		right right and one of the reasons they fixed up the freons <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eleven twelve</NUMEX> and thirteen in in in that area was because they were inexpensive uh they could be made uh you know cheap inexpensive and lots of it
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> and in that and its properties were great uh with uh the machinery didn't have to have lots of expensive machinery to uh get your heating and cooling cycles to work
 		so
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh</ENAMEX> so have they stopped that practice now
 	
 	
 		well  course there's only a a  tremendous number of a refrigerators and freon excuse me refrigerators and freezers
 		both commercial and residential uh utilizing freon twelve and of course the the new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> i guess starting with nineteen nineteen <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ninety three</NUMEX> will not have freon twelve in their systems
 		but uh there's you know there's the ton of after market machines and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et cetera et</ENAMEX> cetera
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		and that's got me very concerned you know highly concerned that uh
 		
 
 		it's gonna be quite a while before we can uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		undo this now that could spawn several good industries and help pull us out of this recession but you got to have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that can make you know earn a salary to pay for this conversion
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so we're so i see us in a kind somewhat of a catch <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty two</TIMEX> unless we unless the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX> or industry and or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> go together and and come up with a way to uh
 		have us uh as a an unemployed the part of the unemployed society be able to be gainfully employed again converting all this freon twelve stuff into uh the new nonpolluting uh compound
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		because as i say there is a there's a tremendous well how many uh uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> own a refrigerator
 		and then do you know that number and then how many own a a freezer separate from
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and how many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> especially here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> own <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trucks</ENAMEX> with air conditioning
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i mean this is there there are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that that make it have a thriving business uh that do nothing but heating and air conditioning on on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">automobiles</ENAMEX> and trucks
 		and uh the only reason i didn't uh get into that more when i was had my little business was because uh most of your uh air conditioning in in on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicles</ENAMEX> tend to be greasy and dirty to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-th</ENAMEX> degree
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i mean
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so uh that's why i stayed in stayed more towards towards uh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> and that's a polluting polluting type deal too is the excessive um you know uh petroleum products in your engine bay and so forth and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dirt</ENAMEX> and grit and
 		the those <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> mixed together with with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> and uh  really make a uh make a mess
 	
 	
 		um yeah
 		yeah i hate to see a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> going down the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> or even a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">truck</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bus</ENAMEX> for that matter that that's putting out a lot of dark
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		smoke and i know there's a lot of pollutants we can't even see coming out of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> but that that particular bothers me
 	
 	
 		right
 		well most
 		most of the time when you see bus uh you know the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">buses</ENAMEX> with the diesel that's uh those are <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon particles</ENAMEX> and uh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon dioxide</ENAMEX> and water vapor
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> because when you when diesel diesel is burned it's it you know diesel <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fuel</ENAMEX> is burned in a in a in the diesel engine it's burned so completely
 		that you don't have any uh uh nitrous oxides uh or oxides of nitrogen uh to uh form
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		because of by virtue of the very combustion process of the diesel engine
 		because diesel <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> is uh
 		is not very volatile
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know where <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gasoline</ENAMEX> if you leave a little pail of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gasoline</ENAMEX> out before long it's gone
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diesel</ENAMEX> is going to be around because it doesn't evaporate easily
 		and it's got uh you know it's it's latent heat is high but it's slow burning at at uh
 		normal pressures that's why your diesel engines have such high compression ratios
 	
 	
 		oh i see
 	
 	
 		as the as the air is heated you know by virtue of the compression process to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">like one</NUMEX> to nineteen or nineteen to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> ratio
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and so if it the car sucks in uh fifty degrees
