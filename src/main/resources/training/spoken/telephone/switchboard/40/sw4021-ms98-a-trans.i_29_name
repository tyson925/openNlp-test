 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and then you can just slip that in there it's a lot cheaper of course <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">quarter inch and three quarter inch</NUMEX> aren't much cheaper than each other
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>

 		um
 	
 	
 		and i only need a few more things like a joiner i'd like to have and small some smaller things

 		oh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> everytime we
 		yeah i just bought a a sprayer to finish my project um a high volume low pressure sprayer
 	
 	
 		air uh air uh air pressure

 		it's air it only <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sprays</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> PSI
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		but uh the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">cubic feet</NUMEX> per minute of air flow is up to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ninety</NUMEX> and so that's what
 		that's what gives you your thrust of your paint
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		um do you do
 	
 	
 		how much how much does that cost you
