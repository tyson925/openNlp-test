 
     		
 	
 		you said you're are financial uh financial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planner</ENAMEX> so do you work with individual um
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yes
 	
 	
 		like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> or i mean
 	
 	
 		well we work with both we work with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> and we work with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> and um we do business and personal
 		uh financial planning and budgeting and investing for those people
 	
 	
 		so how do you handle your own account
 	
 	
 		how do i handle my own account
 	
 	
 		your your own budget
 	
 	
 		uh well the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> part of being of of a good budget or a good financial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planner</ENAMEX> is to uh number one don't have any debt
 		so yes being debt free is very important and keeping a budget uh below your income is important also
 	
 	
 		hm  right now i think really the only debt we have is our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		oh that's great you're ahead of most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> out there then
 	
 	
 		well good  but we really don't have a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</TIMEX> budget that we live on but we don't spend
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		um frivolously either
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh i mean we don't i don't we don't have anything on the computer that says oops we only have <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">five dollars</NUMEX> left to spend <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</TIMEX> you know it's not that rigid um
 	
 	
 		well a budget does not have to be rigid
 	
 	
 		hm um i know though i'm expecting and um we're thinking about cutting down to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> salary  and so when it comes down to that that is going to be quite a change in our
 		income because i not quite fifty percent but maybe forty percent of our income is based on mine um
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		so i think when  when it comes to that time period we are going to need to watch our our funds a little bit more um right now we're struggling with it oh
 		the thing is that both our <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> are paid off but they are the same age and his my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mine</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> but his is breaking down a lot more you know i haven't had any problems and were were
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh trying to decide well do we go ahead and get another car or do we just drive this one till it breaks
 		you know and if we do what kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> do we want to get and if we do do we should we pay cash for it or uh try to get a low interest
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		you you know interest rate
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well uh one thing that really uh helps i find in budgeting and personally in budget as well as a business budget is prior planning prevents poor results
 		and uh lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> uh have not even considered that maybe that a car payment a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</TIMEX> car payment that they put it in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every month</TIMEX> whether they have a car payment or not
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and therefore they would save up enough money over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple year</TIMEX> period to replace a vehicle when they needed it
 	
 	
 		we both have done that um we both work at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> that have <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">credit unions</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so we had direct deposit you know for our <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> payment anyway and when my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> was paid off i never told them to
 		you know to stop taking that money out so they've still been putting in oh i don't remember how much my payments were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two hundred and fifty three</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">hundred dollars</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		well that is called smart budgeting
 	
 	
 		oh good  smart budgeting is that what you said or just smart
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh it's real financial planning but we're talking about budgeting so
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		that is very smart to do
 	
 	
 		and then my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> has done the same thing with his payments
 		so it's just more to us not necessarily setting up for another car but just going into savings
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i i think our thing right now is the way the interest rates are and uh
 		well that's in our goals i guess for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year first quarter</TIMEX> is to examine our financial
 		standing you know and try to decide how we want to invest our money because right now the the uh interest rates on everything seems to be so low that you know i don't really see any benefit over um uh
 		oh i can't remember what we compared it to but over putting your money in say a CD or market money account or something over just a regular savings there wasn't enough difference
 		in the interest rate to make a different i mean  to uh i mean i guess our savings account is probably a lot more liquid than CDs or or um
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		money money markets i don't know what else there i know there are a bunch of different things you can invest in but
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		right now i don't know what do you think the way things are going right now
 		that
 	
 	
 		well uh um with the economy the way it is it's very important that um we don't spend capital we don't have to because we don't know when we'll need it
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and secondly is is that we need to make our money work for us so we don't have to work harder
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and uh it just takes time to do that and um if a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> has capital resources uh or cash on hand to take care of emergencies
