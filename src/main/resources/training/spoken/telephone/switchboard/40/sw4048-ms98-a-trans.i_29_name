 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		pretty good pretty good so we're talking about drug testing in the work place huh
 	
 	
 		drug testing in the work place um i've been tested a few times just before pre drug employment but that's about it i've never had random drug testing
 	
 	
 		yeah we have random drug testing at in my business but i've never been uh never had to do it yeah yeah they started that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about a year ago</TIMEX> and i think it's mostly for the
 	
 	
 		oh really what
 	
 	
 		the field <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that you know drive <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trucks</ENAMEX> and heavy machinery that kind of stuff
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but uh they they have done some testing around our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> mostly after lunch looking for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> drinking uh drinking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beer</ENAMEX> and stuff at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">lunch time</TIMEX> at least that's
 	
 	
 		oh they do with alcohol
 	
 	
 		pardon
 	
 	
 		they do it with alcohol
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah they they they'll check for alcohol
 	
 	
 		oh i thought it was just like marijuana or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocaine</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		now once once you start doing that stuff you sort of you're sort of stuck into uh checking for the whole the whole thing
 	
 	
 		huh that's interesting what type of field of work are you in
 	
 	
 		yeah it's a
 		i'm in the oil <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX> yeah
 	
 	
 		oh in the oil <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX> okay and you work in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> around
 	
 	
 		yeah i work in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> so uh it's pretty pretty safe environment
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah see i work in the automotive air bag industry where we make the safety bags for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> and we work around around a lot of explosives
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		well that sounds like kind of an important job to be uh straight on
 	
 	
 		yeah so that's you know i'm all for it because the well the type of environment i work in you know working they're working with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">explosives</ENAMEX> and so they could blow up the whole
 		well they have safety features with each of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">explosives</ENAMEX> they use but still it can be dangerous
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah well i i i agree i think that uh
 		you know under certain circumstances especially when you're working in in high risk uh
 		uh industries where you can really hurt other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that that you need to have that kind of stuff
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know if it's as long as it's not abused uh
 		you know random you know as long as it's random and and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX>'s rights are uh are protected i don't have that big a problem with it
 	
 	
 		now do they fire them or do they
 	
 	
 		well see this is it this is where i start having my problems with my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> i work for a private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> and and the the policy is something like
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		see if i can restate this correctly now if you turn yourself in as having a drug related problem then you're eligible for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> counseling
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but if they catch you if you test positive for a a controlled substance then you get fired
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		so it you know it's sort of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of these little catch <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty twos</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		huh that's i think our policy is that all right it's probably the same thing i'm not really sure because
 		anyway i don't have the
 	
 	
 		yeah really it's one of those things that you read once and then if you if you're not worried about it you just forget about it
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but i know they do have counseling and that they do give you a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> chance but i'm not sure if if it's if you get caught or if you turn yourself in
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah our yeah our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>'s a little tougher on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> chance i mean if if they're going to give you the opportunity to turn yourself in then they ought to
 		you know  go out of the way i think a little bit more to uh to help you get you help get you rehabilitated to you know to get get back at your job
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but uh when you're not when you're a private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> the rules don't always apply
 	
 	
 		uh do you think it works very good with that random do you think it limits the
 	
 	
 		well it's  it's hard for me to to evaluate it because everybody i work around is in an office environment and you know it's not
 		i guess i haven't haven't run into anybody that's that's had a problem that's that's been a problem
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh
 		so i guess you know i guess it works uh
 		much like uh
 		well shoot like any lottery i mean everybody's got an equal chance to get picked
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so uh i'd rather have that than you know say well <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A's</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">B's</ENAMEX> are going to be in and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next week</TIMEX> C's and D's are going to come in
 	
 	
 		
 
 		you could time it just right
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah right right
 	
 	
 		i've met <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX> i know when i was working with he had <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> on his breath and i'm not sure if our policy covers that or not that'd be just as dangerous
 	
 	
 		yeah well especially around uh you know equipment machinery and stuff
 	
 	
 		huh
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		you know i've i've gone out and had a had a beer at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">lunch time</TIMEX> but
 		not to excess in any case
 	
 	
 		um-hum do they give any limits on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> or is it
 	
 	
 		uh i don't remember to tell you the truth i don't think they do
 		um
 		well i they must i mean gee whiz
 		that just shows you how much i've been paying attention because i i really don't know i'll have to go into work <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX> and ask
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well you know you can take some of that that testing a little bit too far uh there was a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Houston</ENAMEX> that they did uh an unannounced drug sweep of the of their company
 	
 	
 		oh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh it was it was it was an unannounced sweep of of it was not only drugs
