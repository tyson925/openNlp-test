 
     		
 	
 		oh how's your products been
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um i really haven't had uh too many problems uh seems to me that everything that i buy
 		goes bad just after the warranty runs out
 	
 	
 		i hear that one have you had any lately go out
 	
 	
 		yeah i've had a dryer an ice <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">maker</ENAMEX> a microwave
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> and they unfortunately i bought them all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> at the same time when i bought my new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and uh
 		i really don't have any recourse so i had to call and have them all repaired and that
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		yeah it was a hassle
 	
 	
 		so you didn't get anything even all the all the warranties were out
 	
 	
 		yeah the warranty on the refrigerator uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> the refrigerator warranty's still good but the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">maker</ENAMEX> itself
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		lasted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three years</TIMEX> and it was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three years</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two months</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		you're kidding yeah we just moved into a new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX> too so we had to buy all those too
 	
 	
 		no
 		uh watch out
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		the only thing i've had problems with is um i buy a lot of wood working equipment through the mail and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i bought this paint <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stripper</ENAMEX> where they advertise
 		that it's nontoxic and such and when you get the product
 		it ends up being toxic and all these warnings so
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		i didn't return it because it'd probably cost me more than i just ended up using it
 		but that's about the only thing i've had gone wrong
 	
 	
 		i usually have pretty good luck with appliances but
 		i just uh it was within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two days</TIMEX> that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> of these stopped working and the
 	
 	
 		that's incredible
 	
 	
 		the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">maker</ENAMEX> was uh had to have a new pump and the uh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microwave</ENAMEX> had to have uh some kind of something i can't even pronounce and they uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">dryer</ENAMEX> had to have a new heating element so it was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about almost three hundred dollars</NUMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> of them
 	
 	
 		and they all went out at the same time
 	
 	
 		uh within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two days</TIMEX> of each other
 	
 	
 		or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two days</TIMEX>
 		wow
 	
 	
 		i was
 		it wasn't a good week i was pretty mad
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and plus the place that i'd bought um them all had gone out of business so
 		even if uh i think even if i had uh
 		had kept the warranty the service agreements were
 		with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> that that manufactured but still they were through that
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">retailer</ENAMEX> so i don't know if i could've taken it to another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">retailer</ENAMEX> or not
 	
 	
 		wow that's frustrating
 	
 	
 		but i didn't have to worry about all that because
 		they weren't under warranty
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so
 		it was a call to the local appliance dealer
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		who came out and fixed them all but
 		i the only other things that i've ever had trouble with um
 		i seem to have a real bad trouble with electric hair dryers blow dryers
 	
 	
 		uh-huh they go out a lot
 	
 	
 		yeah i've had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two or three</NUMEX> of those go out one was under warranty and
 		the other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> weren't but i just
 		other than that you know TVs and
 		things like that i haven't ever had any trouble with i don't think products are getting much better though
 	
 	
 		yeah see i'm in the manufacturing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">field</ENAMEX> i just home from work and make um automotive air bags the safety air bags
 	
 	
 		oh really that's interesting
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Morton International</ENAMEX> and
 		i think well it's it's changed a lot with the manufacturing environment we test everything
 		after each assembly process
 		and so our testing is pretty thorough but
 	
 	
 		do you do you test each individual one or do you just test
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		like if you've got <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> you test <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> and by the test results of the one you assume that the other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> are okay
 	
 	
 		um the tests that well we test every <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> electrically we don't
 		i think they test um <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">four or five a day</TIMEX> actually exploding the air bag
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and but we do test after during the assembly <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">project</ENAMEX> product um after we assemble each part of the inflator or what explodes the bag we check to make sure it's there
 		after we install it so each assembly process has an inspection right after it's done
 		and then we do electrical tests on them during the process so
 	
 	
 		well that's something i've never had to use it's never i've never been involved in an automobile accident so
 		luckily that's a product that i haven't had to test
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but i think it's a great idea i'm i'm
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		seems like all the good logical ideas take <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">forever</TIMEX> to
 		to come about but that
 	
 	
 		well they do the all the testing that we have to do through the government
 		it's incredible how much testing they have to do
 	
 	
 		oh i'm sure they wanna be thorough before they but uh even you know i don't mind spending the extra money on the car
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		if you know even if they pass the savings the cost onto the consumer because
 		it just seems like a real worthwhile thing i'm not a real big seat belt my uh
