 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay so <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank</ENAMEX> what uh type of uh
 		budget do you or your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> have
 	
 	
 		well uh i don't know that we really have a budget i have a set amount that i that i save actually well actually there is a a way uh we budget our our money apparently uh
 		my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> uh
 		has so much uh you know gets so much to do shopping with every <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">couple of weeks</TIMEX> and
 		uh we allot each of us so much money per week for our personal stuff gas and things like that and besides that i uh you know i have a set amount that i save <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every every month</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		right that's
 		that's sounds like uh probably a tighter controlled budget than what i have  i'm single so i guess
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh i don't know if that's an excuse for not having a tight budget but i basically
 	
 	
 		really don't need to
 	
 	
 		right i don't need to
 		i'm the only that i have to keep track of so it makes it a little bit easier
 	
 	
 		uh
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">um</ENAMEX> and also i you know i try to save a certain amount <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each month</TIMEX> as well and uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i kind of
 		i kind of have an idea of what my expenses are and i i'm pretty consistent from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">month</TIMEX> to month
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh whenever i need to uh you know whenever that changes i'm pretty well aware of it without actually having to maintain a budget for it
 	
 	
 		right
 		well i found that uh you know things as as i've gotten older i'm in my fifties now but before we use to have to have to very have a very strict budget i had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> and uh
 		you know we we planned out how much we're going to spend for food and how much for for this and for that and kind of anticipate how much things were going to be and
 		uh i guess one interesting aspect of the budgeting i do now is that i set aside uh like i kind of fence off areas of my check book for instance there are certain things that i know will come up uh every so often <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every six months</TIMEX> i have to pay car insurance
 		uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every six months</TIMEX> i have to pay my taxes so i take a set amount i've got a money market account that i do a lot of uh saving in and i also have got a checking account besides that but
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		what i do on my money market account for my taxes for instance which amount to uh an average of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two hundred and</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty</TIMEX> dollars a month i'll just take <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two hundred and</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty</TIMEX> out and i put it in parenthesis i take it out of the right line total
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and put it in parenthesis in there and let it build up <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every month</TIMEX> i add <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two hundred and</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty</TIMEX> dollars to it and then when the tax bill comes in i've got that much set aside
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and i guess that's a way of budgeting
 	
 	
 		yeah that's
 		i guess i kind of do a similar thing more medium uh medium or longer range i just have a
 		maybe a target amount that i'll save for like i'm probably <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">within a year</TIMEX> i'd like to buy a new car
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so i kind of have uh an amount in my mind and i'm making every effort to
 		to  put a little bit away and
 		you know increase the amount i need for a down payment or whatever
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> are are definitely something that you have to figure into your budget not only for buying them but for for keeping them on the road too
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		um
 		you know we've got <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> has a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> and i and i like to drive a pick up <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">truck</ENAMEX> so
 		we're on a schedule where i try every uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three or four years</TIMEX> to to buy a new one and you know i'm constantly making car payments but i figure that's got to be the story of my life anyway is making car payments
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so uh you know i get <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> paid for and uh actually i'm saving up for another one besides so
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		it's
 		you you know it's it's kind of a never ending thing but you try to you try to schedule those things so that
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh you're only you're not paying for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> at the same time i guess what i'm saying
 	
 	
 		right
 		have you thought about uh leasing
 	
 	
 		well i've thought about it but leasing wouldn't i you know i don't use it for my business my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> uses hers just for pleasure and i use <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mine</ENAMEX> just to go back and forth to work which is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only ten miles</NUMEX> away so
 	
 	
 		i see
 		right
 		but if you're rolling it over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every three years</TIMEX> it might be advantageous to do that
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah i guess uh
 	
 	
 		you know typically you  if you purchase your own <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> you tend to make uh the best returns after you pay it off of course you know the longer you keep it beyond that point the more profitable it is to own it yourself
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		right
 		yeah you're right um i i have uh been know to keep
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trucks</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> for oh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> or twelve <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> but i find that after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about four years</TIMEX> they kind of start going down hill and you got to put put stuff into them you know
 	
 	
 		that's right  yeah <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mine</ENAMEX>'s uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven years old</TIMEX> and i think <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> was that was a rough year for it i had expenses a number of expenses
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but uh i'm hoping that
 		most most of them were just kind of uh you know the
 		as you get to a certain number of miles you have to get everything replaced brake shocks and all that so i just went through that whole set <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i'm hoping i'll be have a slow period before i need that again
 	
 	
 		those things can really upset your budget when they when they come in uh you know it's nice to have a little bit set aside for the for the unexpected shall we say
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		so that it doesn't uh kill you all in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one month</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		right what line of work are you in
