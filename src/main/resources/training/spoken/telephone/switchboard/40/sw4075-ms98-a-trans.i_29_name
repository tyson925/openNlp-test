 
     		
 	
 		this recycling it's uh i don't know what you all are doing but we are not doing a whole lot here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arlington</ENAMEX> about it uh they have a trial section that uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		so
 	
 	
 		part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> has been given these uh plastic garbage cans where you are suppose to separate and put it out
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i don't happen to be in the part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> that does that though
 	
 	
 		right here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philadelphia</ENAMEX> the
 		city for residential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> has certain they had a trial section that was having curb side recycling with special containers
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and then they decided to go ahead and phase it in piece by piece so <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every year</TIMEX> a different piece of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> gets added to the list
 		but in my neighborhood they have had voluntary recycling for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several years</TIMEX> now
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first and third Saturdays</TIMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every month</TIMEX> you take your
 		bottles and your <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX> and lets see bottles <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX> to certain <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">corners</ENAMEX> in the neighborhood
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and there is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmer</ENAMEX>'s market that collects the plastic they uh
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		it use to be a firehouse
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but they are trying to get some urban renewal going in here and trying to make the area safer i live near the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> where i'm a grad student
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and it's not the safest neighborhood there is
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so they are trying to get urban renewal going and they one of the things that this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmer</ENAMEX>'s market does is collect plastic
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and they use that money to keep up the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> and organize events and that kind of thing
 	
 	
 		oh that's interesting the grocery <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> here usually have some bins for the plastic bag recycling and some of the plastic jugs and bottle type things
 	
 	
 		right they have that for the plastic bags here too yeah let's see and the
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		we don't have very uh i do not know of a very good place for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glass</ENAMEX> here
 		but i don't i would not know where to take glass
 	
 	
 		uh-huh how about <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aluminum</ENAMEX> cans do they recycle that
 	
 	
 		oh yes they'll recycle those we have places for those and uh for a while they were the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX> there were places but i think they had so many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX> now they are kind of discouraging us from taking them any place
 	
 	
 		right well the only part the thing is that it's probably isn't profitable to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">just</NUMEX> from a standpoint of making new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> to recycle
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but where you end up having a savings is at your landfill last so much longer
 	
 	
 		yes i know and we have that problem  but uh
 	
 	
 		down home i know my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX>
 		um
 		live in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Carolina</ENAMEX> and they have had some landfill filling up problems and they the county built a new landfill and a site that wasn't geologically proper
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so that the landfill consideration is a good reason that probably <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> are still going to end up paying to have the paper taken away but they just won't have to build landfills as often
 	
 	
 		i see
 	
 	
 		another things that they are doing now at home but in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> here is recycling of paper and
 		and that is done by separating the white paper which is i guess is a higher quality
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		from the miscellaneous paper
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		and well they also recycle aluminum cans
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		they have every <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> little cardboard boxes for putting in the white paper and the mixed paper
 	
 	
 		oh that's a good idea
 	
 	
 		and big trash cans down at the ends of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hallways</ENAMEX> that when they get filled up you can go take them down the hall
 	
 	
 		oh
 		but do you all have any place around there for uh used oil <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> oil
 	
 	
 		oh you know that's one thing that kind of bothered me i now when i i use to get my my oil changed when i go down to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Carolina</ENAMEX> there has been a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goodyear</ENAMEX> tire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX> that has been servicing my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> for a number of years
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and they have pretty economical rates but now in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Carolina</ENAMEX> there is this
 		mandatory waste recycling fee and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daddy</ENAMEX> would like to to get the used <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> to pour over fence posts
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		so you know to make the fence posts last longer and weather better but the oil the the uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Goodyear</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX> won't even
 	
 	
 		right uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		they say they can't give you the oil they say it's against the federal law now
 		and that they have to charge the waste recycling fee
 	
 	
 		my goodness
 	
 	
 		so the only way you can get in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Carolina</ENAMEX> anyway and they say it's because of federal law you can get your used <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> back is to do it yourself
 	
 	
 		huh well we do ours ourself and we take it to a uh
