 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		think about what nursing home
 	
 	
 		well  my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> were both in them
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father-in-law</ENAMEX> and it's a tough decision to make
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		because <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> it really confines the uh the people
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		usually they don't care for it  and kind of put you on a guilt trip
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh have you had any experience with them
 	
 	
 		well uh this my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandmother</ENAMEX> in fact uh has a personal care <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> and she keeps a couple of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elderly ladies</ENAMEX> in her home
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh i live i live with her and so uh it's it's uh my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> also does the same thing
 		and uh it's uh
 		i think the quality of care they get is a a lot better uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and a lot more personal but uh
 	
 	
 		but it's still still not like home
 		
 
 	
 	
 		no but uh i think it's uh quite a bit better than than a nursing home i i've just seen
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> just go down hill when they uh go into a nursing home
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that seems to be
 		uh
 	
 	
 		but uh you know and it's hard to really
 		know what kind of a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> is run
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		unless you really know someone that's in there
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and
 		
 
 		you have to kind of take that with a grain of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX> too
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that uh  yeah they may say it's real bad
 		uh just because they don't like it in there
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		whereas it's you know usually pretty good
 		uh  uh the one my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father-in-law</ENAMEX> was in had uh
 		oh God  entertainment every <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> of some you know bingo or cards or whatever
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		well that's good
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and uh and it's easy to check out the meals you know just go up there during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">uh meal time</TIMEX> if you can stand it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		because they don't eat that too well
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		go uh always you always have to check it for cleanliness too
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i'm sorry what was that
 	
 	
 		well you have to make sure they're clean
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and they just had a incident in uh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> here
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		where the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX>'s suing the nursing home
 		he came in at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX>
 		check on his mom
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and she was sick
 		and uh went up to the front desk and said what's wrong with my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mom</ENAMEX> and they said what is she sick
 		we didn't know that
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and here she died <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two hours later</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh oh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		so you know
 		and  well there's an awful lot of variables in them
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i've seen some good ones and uh
 		i've seen some uh my other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandmother</ENAMEX> was in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> and it was
 		i guess they it wasn't too bad but she uh she was a good way away from her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> and uh
 		kind of by herself there and it was it i didn't really like going there at all it was
 		it was not a pleasant experience but uh i think there're some good ones out there's some here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Atlanta</ENAMEX> that are closing down  it's
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		apparently a shaky business right now
 	
 	
 		well i think <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicaid</ENAMEX> payments are uh
 		kind of tightening up on it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		you know in some of them some of them try so darn hard
 		but caring for an elderly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> who might be forgetful
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		is ever ending
 	
 	
 		yeah it is uh one of the ladies my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandmother</ENAMEX> has is apparently
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		showing some signs of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Alzheimer's</ENAMEX> and uh she'll
 		my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandmother</ENAMEX>'ll put her to bed and uh she'll get up you know anywhere from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> times and wonder where the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedroom</ENAMEX> is and you know that kind of thing so
 	
 	
 		well it's around the clock care
 	
 	
 		yeah it uh it takes a lot of patience
 	
 	
 		yeah an awful lot
 	
 	
 		but
 	
 	
 		and and gentleness too
 	
 	
 		yeah she  she's she's pretty good with them though she does a real good job
 		and uh oh i you know i would i would probably throw up my hands and quit but she just you know turn around put her put her back to bed
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know which is good
 		so i i hope i can provide that kind of care for my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandmother</ENAMEX> you know she's still going pretty strong but uh
 		uh i i don't think i would
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">wanna</ENAMEX>
 		turn her over to a nursing home i i'd like to be in and  i think that's the position of a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> but they can't afford it
 		you know
 	
 	
 		costs a bunch
 		my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother-in-law</ENAMEX> is uh eighty two
 		and we'd probably put her in the same <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> that
