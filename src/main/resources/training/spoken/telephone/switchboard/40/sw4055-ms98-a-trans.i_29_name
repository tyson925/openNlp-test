 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Bill</ENAMEX> right
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">okay Bill</ENAMEX> have you done much camping
 	
 	
 		uh yes i'm a scoutmaster in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boy Scouts</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		ah ha
 	
 	
 		i camp uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every month</TIMEX> uh camp <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least one weekend</TIMEX> and during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX> we camp uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two or three weeks</TIMEX> a year
 	
 	
 		oh well that that sounds good
 	
 	
 		i'd say i camp quite a bit
 	
 	
 		yes you do um now do you have a lot of mountain well you don't have mountains in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> do you where do you find places to camp
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well uh we we do a lot of canoeing when we go camping
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and we uh we also uh carry all our equipment with us
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and so we canoe down the river and then sleep on the river on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the uh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sand bars</ENAMEX> and then get up <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the next morning</TIMEX> cook our breakfast and go down the river again
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh
 		oh my word well that sounds adventuresome
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well um i've done oh i would say quite a bit of camping mostly with my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> and i
 	
 	
 		how about yourself
 	
 	
 		um we have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and so we have found that camping with the little ones isn't as enjoyable as just when we go ourselves so we've tried to get out once a year and go
 		on a anniversary camp out and we have gone up into the mountains and uh not necessarily roughed it but we have just found it just real enjoyable to be alone up in the mountains
 	
 	
 		well that's good
 	
 	
 		and then the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> are our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> are old enough now they're twelve and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eleven</NUMEX> and so they're involved involved in the scouting and they do a lot of camping with the scouts
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 		and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year my one twelve year old</TIMEX> went to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">scout camp</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a week</TIMEX> and
 		so <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> they'll both be going and so that's been real enjoyable for them
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">great</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		what uh what kind of camping do they like best do they like it where they have tents and uh do they cook on stoves
 	
 	
 		um yes they've well
 		no actually they've i remember they have taken the the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> the heavy cast iron <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> ovens and done their cooking there over the fire
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i don't think they've taken the stoves um <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> they camped in tents
 		and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> i believe it will be in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tents</ENAMEX> also
 	
 	
 		uh-huh of course i imagine it gets <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cold</ENAMEX> in parts of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Utah</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh yeah</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it doesn't get very cold in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so lots of times we don't even take tents
 	
 	
 		oh is that right
 	
 	
 		we just use trail tarps
 	
 	
 		oh and what does that consist of
 	
 	
 		uh it's just a piece of material that has uh that has a lot of
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh places where you can tie off to it and make it into a tent
 	
 	
 		oh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh like a uh they're very light weight and we use them when we go backpacking
 		so we go backpacking fifteen or <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">twenty miles</NUMEX> then uh they're not very heavy see so you carry them with you and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh
 	
 	
 		they'll keep you dry or whatever
 	
 	
 		yes uh see when when we go camping here we have to take our big huge heavy sleeping bags and  lots of tents and
 		i like to sleep on the air mattresses i don't am not  my bones are getting so old so i like to i like to sleep on the mattresses
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um
 		so have you had any adventures on your camping trips with encounters with wild <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> or anything like that
 	
 	
 		yes yes in fact uh um <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last month</TIMEX> we went camping we saw a lot of deer
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		uh in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX> and in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the afternoon</TIMEX> just <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">deer</ENAMEX> everywhere
 	
 	
 		my word
 		jeez
 	
 	
 		uh  so uh but it  even though uh it wasn't hunting season and we were with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boy Scouts</ENAMEX> so of course we don't uh want to go hunting
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but we got to see a lot of deer
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		um out and about and there's of course we see smaller animals all the time and uh one thing that is a big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the evening</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> uh is uh make sure that all the food's put away and so forth
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		because uh we have uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">armadillos</ENAMEX> do you know what a armadillo is
 	
 	
 		oh uh they're covered with like a heavy armor
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		type stuff uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and possums and uh raccoons
 	
 	
 		my word
 	
 	
 		and uh we have those uh creatures down here that they like to uh
 		they like to go hunting for a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a midnight</TIMEX> snack
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and so that that uh that can be a problem if you don't put all your equipment away
 	
 	
 		oh but they won't necessarily attack a human or bite you or anything
 	
 	
 		they will if you attack them
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		but most time they run away from you
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		if if they if they see you're up you know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but they don't have any problem walking right by you if you're asleep
 	
 	
 		oh my word
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		well that sounds a little less fierce than bears we
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		we want to go
