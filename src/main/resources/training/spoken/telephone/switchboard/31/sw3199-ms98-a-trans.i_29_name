 		okay the things that came across you know they said to make it memorable memorable but i thought <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of all you needed to
 		kind of about the same time <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every year</TIMEX> like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the same week</TIMEX> of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the same month</TIMEX>
 		and and then you'd have to send out
 		uh you know good flyers and then mail to all that you wanted to attend
 		and of course food and fun are going to be your your
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ways</ENAMEX> to get <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> there um the ones that i've attended
 		some have had breakfast and lunch and it's been a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">whole day</TIMEX> affair some  of course just have lunch or

 		uh all kinds of events are usually held
 		i've seen talents for  mainly the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> that are there and
