 
     		
 	
 		basically um my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> and myself use the credit cards in regards to major purchases we really don't get into small little purchases if we're going to purchase something quite large we might put it on a credit card but
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		other than that it's not something that we use a lot of um
 		we may have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two or three</NUMEX> versus um i know a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to a half a dozen</NUMEX> or uh up to a dozen credit cards but um ours are just major credit cards that we have and uh use uh
 		use only when when we feel it's necessary to make a big purchase
 	
 	
 		yeah is that like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Visa</ENAMEX> and and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MasterCard</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		do you have department store credit cards too or
 	
 	
 		uh yeah <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sears</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sears</ENAMEX> is pretty major with us simply because we do um
 	
 	
 		appliances
 	
 	
 		appliances and things like that and they're real good with their appliance and stuff like that so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh we try to avoid them with a passion because of the percent of interest rate if you've got the cash to pay for something it's better to do it that way than versus credit cards unless it's a small enough sum that you can do it within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a two three month</TIMEX> period but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		if it's uh
 		any large purchases um you've got to kind of think about um how much you're going to put down as far as uh payments on it so that you're not getting eighteen percent or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">twenty percent</NUMEX> interest taken off so
 	
 	
 		right
 		my my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> and i do basically the same thing but we we end up sneaking <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a few</NUMEX> in there that surprise
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		we still pay it off <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every month</TIMEX> if it kills us  but we do it mainly for you know the cash flow what is that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		oh float that's the word float and i often will keep track track of what i've charged and sometimes deduct it from my checkbook already
 	
 	
 		uh-huh sure sure
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		sure so you know
 	
 	
 		and sometimes just and keep a list and make sure i
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		i don't go over a certain limit especially around birthdays you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		exactly exactly yeah
 	
 	
 		oh
 		if we go out to a restaurant oh just to float it or i don't know
 	
 	
 		or if it's a business transaction a lot of times that's important too to keep a better receipt of it so yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yes my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> has a
 		uh
 		or anytime like a plane ticket or you know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		even if we have the i'm sure we'd have the cash before we got it but
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		the float for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than a hundred dollars</NUMEX> seems real nice for that
 	
 	
 		sure
 		oh sure for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the month</TIMEX> or whatever
 	
 	
 		that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty days</TIMEX>  or whatever
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		exactly
 	
 	
 		we have a new one from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX> and we have you know haven't used that one too much  be interesting that's nice  because you can use it for a calling card also
 	
 	
 		so
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh yeah</ENAMEX>
 		exactly sure
 	
 	
 		it's a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MasterCard</ENAMEX> too so it's kind of fun uh  but you get a lot of junk mail about them
 	
 	
 		sure yeah
 		oh yeah and you always get these preapproved uh credit card things coming through uh your credit is great so let's send you another credit card or it's preapproved for
 	
 	
 		yeah you're such a a wonderful person
 	
 	
 		such such to entice you to get more credit cards
 	
 	
 		we'll give you <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">five thousand dollars</NUMEX> up front
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and so you know we always laugh about that because it's quite a bit i mean you know you always constantly getting those preapproved stuff so
 	
 	
 		right do you have uh uh an annual fee on yours or  do you get yours through a bank or
 	
 	
 		uh ours is through a bank yeah we had it <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a long time ago</TIMEX> through a banking system so yeah just a but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i i can't see paying an annual fee for it i mean i almost
 	
 	
 		oh you're already paying them uh if you're if you don't pay it off within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that month</TIMEX> interest anyway so yeah that's exactly it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so  okay
 	
 	
 		well it sounds like i'm being paged otherwise so that
 	
 	
 		okay all right thanks a lot by now
 	
 	
 		good talking to you thanks bye-bye
