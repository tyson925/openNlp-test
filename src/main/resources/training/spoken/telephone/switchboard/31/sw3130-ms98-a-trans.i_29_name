 		good <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX>
 		yes we do we've got um a pickup twice <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a week</TIMEX> that they come out and they have their own special bin that they hand it out to everybody and they take it uh-huh
 	
 	
 		do
 		oh really and it's twice a week
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		really we have recently started uh a bin program here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Plano</ENAMEX> where uh used to be we we put all of our trash in green bags and the trash <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> came out <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twice a week</TIMEX> and picked up
 		and now they have uh these large green containers
 		and you have to put your trash that you don't recycle in there and then they haven't started curbside recycling yet but they're but they're planning on doing it very soon apparently the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trucks</ENAMEX> that they had
 		um lined up they needed the parts for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX>  and so that put off the program for a while but uh do you recycle
 	
 	
 		oh
 		um uh my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> do  put it that way they they've been recycling cans for extra money so that's that's been their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> money and they're fixing to go to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Disneyland</ENAMEX> so
 	
 	
 		do they uh-huh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh well that's great well that's the way we started too my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> was going to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Camp Goddard um</ENAMEX> which is through the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Plano</ENAMEX> school system you know in the fall
 	
 	
 		so yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">couple of years ago</TIMEX> and she had to earn money for it and she was too young to babysit so that's how she started she started recycling cans and from there we now recycle <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glass</ENAMEX> and newspapers
 		and uh aluminum cans and plastics uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		really
 		is is is that the same way as with the aluminum cans where you go and they weigh it or whatever and
 	
 	
 		no the the only thing we get paid for are the aluminum cans um the rest of it we just do because
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		
 
 		my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> has become hooked on recycling and so you know we don't get paid for that but that's okay you know that it's it's not that much of a bother really you just have to rinse out your bottles or whatever and we use a lot of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">two liter</NUMEX> bottles
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">um</ENAMEX> and like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk cartons</ENAMEX> and things like that it's amazing how much plastic you generate
 	
 	
 		yeah i was amazed at how many cans that we got uh because when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> first went down i said that you know that's great and i was thinking you know maybe i'd help supplement it you know when they turned them in but
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		its amazing how many cans you go through
 	
 	
 		yeah it really is yeah it really is well all that stuff and how much how much we have reduced
 	
 	
 		and how fast they accumulate
 	
 	
 		our waste you know that we we're generating a week um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i know our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> when we first went to this bin program said oh there's no way you know we're going to have to have pickup twice <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a week</TIMEX> they were real upset but they weren't they were only picking up once a week and we said to them if you recycle
 		you'll you'll you know you'll go <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks</TIMEX> without having to put out the green container and uh it's it's really amazing the other thing he does that my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> a real <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stickler</ENAMEX> about is we don't collect our grass clippings
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		really
 	
 	
 		no he he got a little mulcher thing it's just a little attachment for the lawn mower
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and we mow once a week you know no no more often then that and then the clippings just get mulched up and then just lay on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">on on the um</ENAMEX> on the lawn
 		and it's amazing it's amazing we don't collect any of that and that that has cut down a lot in what we throw out
 	
 	
 		yeah well well we don't ever we don't catch it either mainly because my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> rarely has time to mow the yard so if it mows gets mowed i do it normally and i can't mow the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">yard</ENAMEX> with the grass catch on it it's too heavy
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so i just mow i just mow it and leave it and it just soaks in
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		sure it does sure it does it really does and it
 		actually they say that you're wasting fertilizer if you're not uh if you're catching your grass clippings that that's that much <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fertilizer</ENAMEX> you have to use because it does fertilize the lawn it's amazing
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah oh i like it better doing it well one it cuts down on my mow time anyway and you zip through it quicker
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh</ENAMEX> that's true that's true that's true
 		well i i really think you're going to get hooked on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plastics</ENAMEX> and paper  before you know it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		probably we probably will
 	
 	
 		it's it's really not that much trouble we keep a large plastic uh just a you know a garbage bag in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garage</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and as soon as we use something you know we crush it up and put it out there and then you know <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every few weeks</TIMEX> we have recycling a recycling center like near <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wal-Mart</ENAMEX> they're they have the containers that you can just go over there and drop it in and it's really no trouble
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh i feel like at least we're doing something
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know uh um i read a book <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time or a magazine a magazine article and they said something about how
 		you don't realize even just your small contribution it seems like a small contribution but it's not if everyone were to recycle just their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX> they would save save <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> a day
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a day</TIMEX> just from not throwing out your <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX> and uh when you read that you think well gee maybe it is a big deal you know
 	
 	
 		what what makes me sick is is when they show the the dump sites
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know and and how big they are or like in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">barges</ENAMEX> that that go up and down the the river and they don't have any place to put it and it just floats in the and it's like ugh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yes
 		yeah
 		yeah yeah yeah and that's and that's really not necessary
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		it really isn't if everybody would do just a little bit it would make a big difference it would make a huge impact so i'm excited about the recycling program in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plano i i</ENAMEX> can't wait for them to get it started
 		um because that it'll be that much easier for us you know like i said now we have to take it over to to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wal-Mart</ENAMEX> it would be real nice if they just came by and just picked up um
 	
 	
 		yeah it it's it's convenient out here for them to do
 	
 	
 		now what what do they pick up it's just
 	
 	
 		they pick up the the plastic the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glass</ENAMEX> and the newspaper uh-huh
 	
 	
 		oh they do uh-huh and do you have to sort that or do you just put it all in
 	
 	
 		and they will do the aluminum
 		no you just put it in the one bin and and i guess they do the sorting but um they'll do the aluminum cans too but we don't give them those  the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> keep those so
 	
 	
 		right right so you're doing that now you're doing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX> and the glass oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well we don't we don't take the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX> to begin with when neither one of us are home to to read it so we don't have the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX> but the the plastic and the glass
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		at first when it first started it it it was hard you know because you're just used to throwing everything
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> would come home and go through the trash and say
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		you threw this away  you know  he would get he would get all upset and i'd say it's just such an automatic reaction and now we think before we throw anything away i mean it's really funny we we really
 	
 	
 		
 
 		it is
 	
 	
 		once you get into the habit of it it's okay it's just it's just making it a habit that's hard
 	
 	
 		oh i know well the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> have even got to the point where they if they see anybody going in the trash can with a can you know they they're oh no don't do that and they go to the sink they rinse them out and they put them upside down they let them drain and and then uh after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of days</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		they take them all outside and i put them in a big bag anyway and then they dump the bag out and then they crush them so that's their activity thing they go out there and crush so
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tha t</ENAMEX>'s fun yeah yeah yeah oh that's a lot of fun that's a lot of fun well that's great well i'm to hear you're doing that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> was here recently from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Connecticut</ENAMEX> and they have a deposit on all their bottles and cans
 	
 	
 		oh really
