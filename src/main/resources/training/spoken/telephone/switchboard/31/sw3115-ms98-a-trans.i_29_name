 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		all right and and your occupation is teaching
 	
 	
 		i'm a i'm a substitute <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> is is this <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pat</ENAMEX> i'm talking to now yeah i'm a substitute <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> in i believe the same school system we both work in
 	
 	
 		substitute teacher
 		yes it is it is uh-huh
 		right well i was just trying to make an introduction here
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		but oh and and i haven't told you i'm going to be at a different <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> now
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		i've just gotten a another job at an elementary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barron</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		well i bet you're you're you may dress differently then for that
 	
 	
 		right i well not really i've got the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX> i've got to uh read to kindergartners so i'm going to be down on the floor with them i've got <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about forty</NUMEX> kindergartners i'm going to be doing working with every day
 		for uh you know <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a half hour</TIMEX> so i'll be i'll probably be wearing slacks as often as i do
 		because i'm i'm if i'm going to be down on the floor messing with them i'm not going to wear nylons and you know nice nylons and dresses
 	
 	
 		well
 		what i wear sometimes depends on on how cold i think the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> might be or what room i might be in since i'm a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sub</ENAMEX> and have different <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> to go to and always carry a sweater
 	
 	
 		right
 		well of course you've been at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clark</ENAMEX> enough that you know it's always cold
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		but you don't know uh
 		i guess at some of the other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> you go to unless you've been there
 	
 	
 		you know you try to layer so you can add or or or take off
 	
 	
 		subtract right
 	
 	
 		and it's it's interesting to notice when you go to different <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> that some are a little more fancier than others and have a very casual
 		uh
 	
 	
 		i i think some of the dress codes are different at different <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> that's one of things one of the things i ask about
 		you know whether whether she would allow slacks and she said she doesn't have a problem with that she just didn't like sloppy dressing
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and and i said well you know that was okay and i'm basically i just you know i wear slacks <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> round except every about once a week i try to wear a skirt and and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the winter</TIMEX> you know i just add a
 		maybe wear longer sleeve shirts than i do in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX> and add a heavier jacket or you know wear jackets more in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the winter</TIMEX> than i do in the summer
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		that's about
 		i don't i don't really work in a profession that requires that i wear a business suit and
 		you know look really
 	
 	
 		right and well for me sometimes they even have dress up <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> or they you know have have spirit week that that you wear your different <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outfits</ENAMEX> and you have to have the color for that particular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> if you if you choose to participate in spirit week
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right right
 	
 	
 		and one might be a hat day where you have to come up with some
 		sort of hat
 	
 	
 		and you never know that though sometimes when you're going in do you
 	
 	
 		no but because i sort of stick to several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> uh i'm usually aware that there might be a spirit week going on and and might might remember to do it and then many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> on a particular day during uh
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		i guess football season maybe <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all year</TIMEX> long they wear the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> colors for uh game day which
 	
 	
 		right on what <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday Thursday</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		right it might be <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> for the high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> and it may be <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX> for the senior high schools
 	
 	
 		right right so that would kind of give you
 		a clue i guess and and sometimes you get the long term stuff so you're aware ahead of time
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		of what's going on that so that's
 		and i don't know you know i i think about well the dress code they have for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> you know are they put <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> and say they have to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> have to wear ties
 		and there can be no blue jeans worn and because some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> i know wear uh
 		dress up jeans not sloppy looking jeans but tapered jeans that they've had dry cleaned so they have got the crease and uh you know they'll wear it with a nice top and and uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i don't know that that looks that bad but if you're going to tell the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> they can have to dress up i guess you can tell the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> that too
 	
 	
 		yeah it it i see that the i think the elementary school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> or maybe even the middle school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> dress a little fancier than than some of the high school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> i think
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but it i think it varies it it just so much anything anything can go
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and you can see in some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">departments</ENAMEX> in some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> like history at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clark</ENAMEX> they're all pretty fancy
 		but they're just sort of into clothes and then there's other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">departments</ENAMEX> that aren't and they'll just wear your common ordinary you know whatever you might
 	
 	
 		right right right
 		yeah there's a couple <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> up there that that do dress up more than others right
 	
 	
 		might say
 		right
 		and so you try to maybe follow those if you know you're going there you don't want to dress too tacky because you're  going to be in the same <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> with them
 	
 	
 		right
 		well and you always course it's a standing joke you know when the when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> come in in a a tie and a suit coat you say you know what have you got a job interview <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> or there there's
 	
 	
 		
 
 		or you're going to be observed
 	
 	
 		there's usually yeah there's usually something going on that that uh and would would uh cause that to happen and i i don't know how a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coach</ENAMEX> would feel if that teaches health or
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		English you know <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> or whatever that they had to wear a tie i some of those male <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coaches</ENAMEX> that might really
 	
 	
 		right they go around in their little coaching shorts or parachute pants
 	
 	
 		right and a T-shirt
 		right that i didn't ever understand i mean we've got <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coaches</ENAMEX> that teach health for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five periods</TIMEX> and then have athletics <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">sixth</NUMEX> period so
 	
 	
 		yeah well at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vines</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coaches</ENAMEX> don't do that they they dress pretty good i would say and then they go to their coaching and they they put their shorts on there
 	
 	
 		whether
 		change then well see that's what i would think
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		that's what i would think
 	
 	
 		but they they don't look you know they don't wear their sweat pants or or anything they're they dress like any other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> would in in a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">classroom</ENAMEX> situation not in PE
 	
 	
 		right
 		course we had had one coach <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> period he'd teach <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PE</ENAMEX> and the next period <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Health</ENAMEX> and then a period of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PE</ENAMEX> and and that's hard you know so he just left warm-ups on but
 	
 	
 		those i can understand yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh no i think really probably they could they could uh
 		really and i don't know if if they put make uniforms the thing for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> i guess the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> will have to follow suit with a dark skirt and a white top and
 	
 	
 		i don't think we'll ever get to that no i don't think i think we're going the opposite direction it's the parochial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> that i guess many times they've had uniforms for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> i really don't really know if they still do
 	
 	
 		you don't think so
 		well some of them yes they do and and it's not at some of the private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> but even there's a couple public <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> where where the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> wear uniforms and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> you know dress in accordance with that
 	
 	
 		it certainly makes it easier to dress
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		well it's certainly cheaper and easier in the long run i think that you don't have to be concerned about your wardrobe
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		well i i think it would make a difference at school i i don't think we should be spending time
 		saying somebody's wearing torn clothing or wearing shorts too shorts too short or they've got the really short skirt and the black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nylons</ENAMEX> and the high you know i mean
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it's a lot of trouble to to take care of that and of course the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> say then why bother just let me wear what i want and and yet we can't to that either i'd like to see them go to to not necessarily a uniform but saying that they've got to wear
 		a button down shirt you know that would that would alleviate any T-shirts with sayings on them but if they could wear a button-down shirt and a pair of dark slacks
 		and they could buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">th</ENAMEX> em anywhere they wanted and you know and
 	
 	
 		yeah but i doubt that that would come about that that will come about just  i yeah i i
 	
 	
 		and then the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> could
 		right i don't no not in Plano
 	
 	
 		no not yeah
 	
 	
 		they may get away but they said in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> that that helps their educational process there
 	
 	
 		well i think it does it it takes their minds off of of trying to compete
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Highland Park</ENAMEX>'s thinking about going that route
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so it
 		and then i think that's going to push <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> to dress a lot more professionally than they do
 	
 	
 		yeah i i don't think a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> are very professional but
 	
 	
 		yeah i agree with you on
