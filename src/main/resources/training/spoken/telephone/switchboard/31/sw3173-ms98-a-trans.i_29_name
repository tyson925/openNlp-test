 		i think our next <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> i would like something like a an economy <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> that gets really good mileage and um one that's really reliable i would
 		i think probably not an a brand new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> but maybe something like a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sentra</ENAMEX> or something like that um something my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> can
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		and of course it has to have air conditioning
 	
 	
 		oh absolutely air air conditioning and a radio uh AM FM and a cassette <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">player</ENAMEX> and um
 		what else do i want
 	
 	
 		does it have to be a special color
 	
 	
 		um i would think kind of a subdued color would be nice you know a a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">navy</ENAMEX> blue or a
 	
 	
 		
 
 		it sounds like something your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> would drive right
 	
 	
 		yeah that's what it would be for is for him to drive
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		back and forth to work
 	
 	
 		yeah well i don't think we're looking for another car right now because we just bought <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> but when we were looking we were looking for something had enough seat belts of course and we wanted air conditioning and
 		a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">five</NUMEX> speed and that was kind of iffy but that made it better economically so
 	
 	
 		i think that's something we might want too is some kind of standard transmission at least rather than automatic
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		we'll probably have to look for a another <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> sometime and we'd look for about what you're looking for something but probably real cheap it wouldn't be a used used <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> so but no
 	
 	
 		i think we would want one that even though it was a compact <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> or whatever that it would still be nice enough that um you could take someone in it and not be embarrassed
 	
 	
 		um-hum would you like <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> doors or it doesn't really matter
 	
 	
 		uh probably well probably probably that would be a good idea
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		hm yeah it it's hard for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to get in with a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> door sometimes so
 	
 	
 		that's right so if we wanted it to take <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> out with it that's a good thought i
 	
 	
 		it be fun just to win one wouldn't it that would be great alrighty well i i think that's all that we need to say
 	
 	
 		that hadn't crossed my mind
 		yes i would go for that
 		well thank you for calling
 	
 	
 		all right we'll talk to you later bye bye
 	
 	
 		all right good-bye
