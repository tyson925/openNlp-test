 
     		
 	
 		
 
 		well <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom</ENAMEX> just <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">tonight</TIMEX> i was working on my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> out of necessity and i had uh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">uh</ENAMEX> had a long age old problem of my bright lights not working uh this is the type of uh switch where you flip the the lever the turn signal on the column
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and when i would uh put it in the bright light position the lights would go out completely
 		which is even worse than them just not getting bright
 	
 	
 		exactly
 	
 	
 		and i had presumed that it was the switch and uh this is uh an older <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> it's a seventy <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> MG
 		so i had to mail order the part uh which i had done and tonight i went out and uh at least hooked in the new part only to discover that that apparently is not the problem it's not in the switch because it does the same thing with the new switch
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so i'll be faced with having to return that product and uh hoping that uh you know that they will accept it although it's been removed from the box it's obviously not been really used
 	
 	
 		did did did you do the diagnosis or or was it just an assumption that that's probably the part that failed
 	
 	
 		uh i had
 		done what diagnosis i could primarily by looking at a wiring diagram that i did have of the car
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh pretty much decided that that had to be the problem i talked to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> mechanic about it and he suspected the switch also
 		uh but i've not you know i really don't know what the problem might be it it the other switch could be the main switch itself uh that turns the lights on or off which is on the dashboard
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh it might be tied into the equation somehow
 		but uh
 	
 	
 		yeah i know uh when working with the uh flashers
 		there is uh usually a a special fuse that operates the flashers do you have a separate fuse for your high beam as opposed to your low beam
 	
 	
 		i i don't know i should look at that i don't remember seeing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> in the uh
 		in the the diagram but i'll have to go back and look at that
 	
 	
 		diagram
 		yeah i don't even know if my current <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> have a separate fuse i know sometimes when you think there are uh
 		things running while they're at the same <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> like the headlamp
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you tend to think well there's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> fuse operating the whole thing but sometimes the extra amperage that a high beam drives as opposed to a low beam requires uh the use of a of a maybe a higher fuse
 	
 	
 		yeah that's a good idea
 	
 	
 		so that's a possibility
 	
 	
 		what i've typically found when that uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> are pretty good about accepting returns on products like that when they're not needed after all and i hope that that's the case this time
 	
 	
 		is this a a mail order <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parts house</ENAMEX> that specializes in in parts for uh old imports
 	
 	
 		right exactly it's out of uh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kansas</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um
 		um so it's not <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">J C Whitney</ENAMEX> or somebody like that
 	
 	
 		somewhere
 		no it's not i also got a piece of chrome for the the hood that they had indicated was the right part for this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> but it is not either it's obviously doesn't quite fit
 		so it must be for a different year
 		so i'll have to try to return that as well
 	
 	
 		yeah have you found any uh uh reliable import service <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in the metroplex
 	
 	
 		well i had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> that i used for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> on this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> because i've owned this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> since it was new
 		and uh but it's over like in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brook Hollow</ENAMEX> industrial district down on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stemmons</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Inwood</ENAMEX> area
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i hadn't used him for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">some years</TIMEX> and the last time i called him back it turned out that he had further specialized instead of uh all <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">import cars</ENAMEX> he has narrowed it down to where he only works on uh <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> and
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX>  i'm not sure that he works on much else at all but he doesn't work on <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> any more and gave me the name of somebody else to take a look at it
 	
 	
 		i'll be darned
 	
 	
 		so uh uh i may have to check with that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> as it turns out that one that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX> is near where i now work so i'll uh i should be able to take it in and check that part out
 		i've not had to to exchange any other parts recently uh
 		because they were defective now i've had had pretty good luck i just however did uh have to get a
 		a uh one of these jam box portable dual cassette players
 		uh repaired i'd purchased it at at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam</ENAMEX>'s and i had assumed that it had a ninety day warranty and i should have checked more carefully and done a better job of saving the receipt
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		because uh i didn't take it in right away and let a whole year go by uh some of the buttons didn't work right where you had to actually physically hold them down to get it to record or to play
 		and as it turned out it had <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a full year</TIMEX>'s warranty and i could have gotten it repaired for free but i had to take it in while it was in the shop i ended up finding the receipt that i thought had long since been lost
 	
 	
 		oh my goodness
 	
 	
 		uh but it didn't do me any good because i had i had missed the window by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about a week or two</TIMEX> so i didn't even i didn't really uh even bring it up when i went in to pick it up
 	
 	
 		oh no
 	
 	
 		but uh that's really my only experience in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past year</TIMEX> where i've had to take a product back because of a defect
 	
 	
 		well ours wasn't within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last year</TIMEX> i guess it's been within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last two years</TIMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judy</ENAMEX> has an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oldsmobile</ENAMEX> that we bought new and it's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> with the uh electronic ignition and the computer controlled mixer and uh
 		i don't know what else it all controls but the fuel mixture and cruise control and things of that sort
 		and we found that the uh uh we were having <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> problems it was
 		idling fast when you first started the engine to the point that we <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> on a hill under our car <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX> and
 		when you first dropped it into geared it would immediately want to back up into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">alley</ENAMEX> and knowing that you always had to keep your foot on the brake hard otherwise it would just wrench control away from you
 	
 	
 		good grief
 	
 	
 		and the other problem <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judy</ENAMEX> would have is occasionally she would uh be driving along uh decelerating like coming to a stop sign but not yet stopped at the stop sign and the engine would just quit
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so we took it back to the uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oldsmobile</ENAMEX> place
 		and asked them to check it out and at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> they thought it was just a matter of timing so they adjusted timing and the problem didn't go away so we ended up taking it back again
 		i don't know why they don't look at these things the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time around but the
 		<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> time around they looked at their uh recall service and their uh service reports from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX> whatever and
 		and they had a description of the exact problem we were experiencing that apparently was a programming error in the uh computer control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> which fortunately they replaced under warranty because it was about a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three hundred or three hundred</NUMEX> and fifty dollar part
 	
 	
 		huh
 		my goodness
 	
 	
 		and uh so once they replaced it then the the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> seemed to work fine
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		for a considerable period of time and now it seems to be we don't we're not experiencing the stalling but we're still experiencing a very uneven
