 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		okay i guess we're going to discuss food and cooking
 	
 	
 		alright
 	
 	
 		do you enjoy cooking
 	
 	
 		sometimes not all the time
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i'm kind of that way too when i have i i enjoy cooking when i have time
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i don't enjoy preparing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meals</ENAMEX> a day everyday
 	
 	
 		yeah that that's about the same boat i'm in too
 	
 	
 		it gets kind of boring
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		how big is the family you <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cook</ENAMEX> for
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">uh five</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh-huh we have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> so
 		and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of them are teenage <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> so
 	
 	
 		oh yeah well i'll be hitting that fairly soon because all of mine are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> too so
 	
 	
 		are they
 	
 	
 		and they get pretty particular sometimes in what they want to have
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah we have that problem too but also now it's just the amount that they eat it's just absolutely incredible
 	
 	
 		uh
 		oh yeah well see i my my oldest is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> and he already he already does that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		does he  well
 	
 	
 		and i told him he's going to have to get a part-time job by the time he reaches teenage <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> so he can eat
 	
 	
 		yeah  that's true uh
 		do you have any favorite things that you serve when you are doing a special meal
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		favorite recipes that you've come across or
 	
 	
 		my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> and i our favorite <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meal</ENAMEX> is um and we do it like for special stuff celebrations and we have like steak and he does the steak and then uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		out on the grill uh-huh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh</ENAMEX> and he marinates it in his special stuff that he does and it's real good and uh i do sauteed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mushrooms</ENAMEX> so and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">asparagus</ENAMEX> and that's our favorite
 	
 	
 		oh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 		ooh yeah
 		ooh that's sound good i love that
 	
 	
 		dinner
 	
 	
 		my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> really likes seafood
 	
 	
 		yeah so do we
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">um</ENAMEX> and uh i think that no matter what i do i don't serve enough of it really to uh to suit him i didn't grow up eating that much seafood
 		and um so i don't know it's just kind of not natural to me but i like it and uh i don't know one of his favorite things is uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		well it's called <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seafood stew</ENAMEX> and it's really it's really like a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">soup soup</ENAMEX> that that you serve over <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh it has oysters and shrimp and crab in it and
 	
 	
 		it's not the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> with all the shells and stuff in it is it
 	
 	
 		no no that's kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Louisiana</ENAMEX> i think if you do that yeah  i don't either
 	
 	
 		i don't know what that i don't see how you eat that but
 	
 	
 		but uh no this is just really it is really good and and one thing that's good is it makes the a large amount and so i freeze usually we eat one and i freeze <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> containers of it then that's just real quick to get it out and serve it over <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		but neither of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> will eat it you know so then they eat a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pizza</ENAMEX> or
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		so it
 		yeah it defeats the purpose
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah it really does one thing i've run across
 		recently though a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> gave me a recipe that i really like for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chicken enchiladas</ENAMEX> have you made them
 	
 	
 		oh yeah yeah my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> makes those i'm not i don't eat enchiladas i i don't like enchiladas i don't like the texture i don't know i guess it's the texture or something i don't like the taste of enchiladas but everyone else in my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> does
 	
 	
 		does he ooh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 		well are these are done with a flour tortilla is that what he uses yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i don't know i it's i don't know what i don't know i i don't know what it is about the enchiladas i just and i'm the only one including my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mom</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dad</ENAMEX> and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> i'm the only one that doesn't eat it but my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> love it you know
 	
 	
 		isn't that something yeah
 		i was going to say my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> both eat it i guess that's one thing that i particularly like um but i think it's good for you know for for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> too and i've made it a few times um and you can make a lot at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		when i needed to make something to uh to give somebody you know like you know to take over to somebody's <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> or something else
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i've got a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chicken casserole</ENAMEX> that's like that that that i've
 	
 	
 		it it's nice when it makes a lot because you can feed your own <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> and then uh-huh
 	
 	
 		yeah because i when i make this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chicken</ENAMEX> casserole i it it makes a real big casserole and then another one that i freeze
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so or i give it to my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mom</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dad</ENAMEX> if i know we're not going to eat
 	
 	
 		what what does it have in it
 	
 	
 		it's just you can use <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chicken</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">turkey</ENAMEX> because my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mom</ENAMEX> started making it like right after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thanksgiving</TIMEX> and using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">leftover turkey</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		sure
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and it's <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX> and i i i when i do recipes i just throw stuff in i don't i'm not real good about measuring because i just i do it to taste
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh sure sometimes those are the best ones
 	
 	
 		and
 		well yeah but it it's like it's just chicken it it's as much as you want you know torn up and and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cream</ENAMEX> of chicken <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">soup</ENAMEX> and some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mayonnaise</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lemon juice</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and celery and that's it and some hard boiled eggs
 	
 	
 		yeah ooh that sounds good
 	
 	
 		and that's it you just mix it all together and pop it in the oven just to you know heat it through and you sprinkle uh that those um toasted onion rings
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh yeah those are good aren't they uh-huh
 	
 	
 		on top of it for the crunchy and that's it you know and it it it goes and it's filling because of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um
 		that sounds good
 		right
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		you cook the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX> before you put it in yeah
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh yeah</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i bet the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mayonnaise</ENAMEX> in there makes it really kind of gives it a tang that would be good
 	
 	
 		yeah it gives it a an extra yeah little tang
 	
 	
 		i guess i would now use the the new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mayonnaise</ENAMEX> free
 	
 	
 		yeah that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol fat</ENAMEX> free
 	
 	
 		yeah that's really wonderful that they're coming out with so many
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		new things like that because like i told my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this summer</TIMEX> i love to eat you know chicken <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salad</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tuna salad</ENAMEX> and stuff like that and and you know basically it certainly a low low calorie you know good thing except then you put your <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mayonnaise</ENAMEX> in there and spoil the whole thing
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		i know
 	
 	
 		you know and now it's it's it's okay and you can even i used to just put a tiny bit in well now i'm just putting more and more in
 	
 	
 		i don't like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tuna salad</ENAMEX> unless it's got lots of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mayonnaise</ENAMEX> in it
 	
 	
 		yeah and it's only it used to be like a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">hundred hundred calories</NUMEX> per tablespoon and now it's like twelve oh i just think that's the best thing to have happened i'm just so excited about that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i know
 	
 	
 		anyway
 	
 	
 		yeah we did the low-cal stuff well with my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> i don't they get enough <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sugar</ENAMEX> and stuff anyway <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mine</ENAMEX> are bouncing off the walls normally anyway and they don't need any added help
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yes
 		right
 	
 	
 		so when we're here at home
 		you know with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sweets</ENAMEX> and stuff they they don't we don't really do that much i do a lot of fruits
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		instead of the cakes and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">candies</ENAMEX> and you know stuff like that and and drink wise they have <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Kool-Aid</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> normally <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">now</TIMEX> when they go to their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandmother</ENAMEX>'s house
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 	
 	
 		which is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every weekend</TIMEX> it's a it's a different
 		it's a different story all around
 	
 	
 		that's when they
 		as our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> would say a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pig</ENAMEX> out huh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh</ENAMEX> that's exactly what it is
 	
 	
 		that's good oh one of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> that that's twelve um  is has high cholesterol
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		have you ever found out about your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		no not yet
 	
 	
 		and my other one does not so oh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year or so ago</TIMEX> he found out and he went on a fairly strict diet to try to get it down and did he was able to get it down
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		it's i think it's mostly hereditary because we really have never eaten high things in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> he's never eaten any <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX> he's never had anything but skim <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk</ENAMEX> and you know i've never bought <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">butter</ENAMEX>  and things like that but um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		huh
 	
 	
 		oh he just left for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> again and it's it's kind of back up um so he needs to be careful again so we've really been talking about the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> you know for him to to be sure to eat yeah and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		the lower cholesterol <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> and stuff
 	
 	
 		so he's eating an apple a day for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last two days</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so all that kind of stuff does really help well i think we've probably talked long enough and
