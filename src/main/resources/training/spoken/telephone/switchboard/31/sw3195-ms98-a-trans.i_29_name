 
     		
 	
 		uh what is what is your <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">practice</ENAMEX> as far as budgeting do you manage the money
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well i  we talk about it but i'm usually the one that sits down and puts the pencil to the paper and and tries to somehow make the ends meet which uh
 	
 	
 		oh i see that's how kind i am too are you married you are i think the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> for the most part end up managing the money my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> always says he earns it and i have to spend only what he earns it
 	
 	
 		um yes yeah
 		i don't mind the spending it's just that i trying to trying to get what you need out of out of what you have that seems to be our challenge so
 	
 	
 		well i don't work outside of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> and he always threatens that when i spend more than what's coming in i have to go back to work so i i manage
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i see well i'm i'm at home also so it does get rather interesting trying to survive on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> salary but uh
 	
 	
 		no do you actually follow a budget
 	
 	
 		well we  pretty well do um  <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several years</TIMEX> we didn't and we found that we just weren't making the most of of what we had
 		and so we we um  set aside a certain amount <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each week</TIMEX> that goes for
 		things that have to be paid for you know just our bills and then
 		what's left we divvy up we try to save a little bit although we're not always successful and then the rest of it just goes for normal <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekly</TIMEX> needs
 	
 	
 		well that's pretty much the way we do um or we did in the past i would say what right at this point our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> are grown
 		and so i really don't have the obligations there anymore that we have to balance to
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know get things together for them
 		and i really just keep very good records and most of our expenses
 		are fairly the same <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every month</TIMEX> with the exception of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utilities</ENAMEX> and things like that and i try to keep my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MasterCards</ENAMEX> and things paid currently
 	
 	
 		right
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh i don't always succeed at that i usually keep <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> with a low interest rate and i'd put things on there that i think i'm not gonna give to
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and then i have another one but for the most part our mortgage and our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utilities</ENAMEX> at this point we're in a new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> and uh they take a pretty big chunk compared to what they used to
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so i'm still getting used to that but we make sure that we just do not buy unless we really can see how we're going to pay for it ahead
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and we do not buy used ah new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> uh do you get into the car
 	
 	
 		well we had new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> um always until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about four years ago</TIMEX> my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> um owned his own <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> and it went under and so
 		we could no longer afford that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</TIMEX> payment and now it's just seems
 		just such a large amount of money to spend that that we do have a used car <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">well</ENAMEX> he has a company <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> also but for our personal <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> we have a used <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car um</ENAMEX> do you think that it's wiser to buy used
 	
 	
 		we do for us very much so in fact we
 		are in a position that most of our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> why wonder why we just don't go to a new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> you know whatever and i said
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		look you <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> are all into <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> payments we haven't had car payments for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">so many years</TIMEX> i love it this way
 		and recently we just created the laugh among everyone because we had a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> that we really liked
 		and it has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eighty two</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">thousand miles</NUMEX> on it and we were kept saying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> wouldn't it be great if we could find another one just like it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 	
 	
 		believe it or not we did we found <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one one</NUMEX> newer the worst part is it's the same color
 	
 	
 		oh no
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		and so everybody's saying you're kidding you have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> the same and i said you know how when you have a bad one you say never again
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		i said well we had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> and we found <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">just seventeen thousand miles</NUMEX> on it and it's <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an eighty five</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		and so i said hey this was a cinch we've paid for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> and we still know now that we have this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> to put all the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">miles</NUMEX> on
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		this is for all the long running back and forth on you know interstate driving and things and we intend to replace our other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> with a much newer <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next couple of years  or next year</TIMEX> probably
 	
 	
 		do you um buy from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX> or from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		generally from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX> and uh it depends because i don't like to sell what we're trading in to an individual
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh unless we we have done that when we had a really good one that we wanted to sell you know uh we were going up to a larger one
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but we have found that by trading in and going through a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealer</ENAMEX> and we always make a deal i mean we have walked out of more <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">dealerships</ENAMEX> saying
 		don't bring us the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> and all of that unless you wanna bring him right away you're gonna get <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> shot at us
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		we will you know
 		and they say well you're kidding you know i no this is the price we're going to give you out the door we don't wanna hear about taxes
