 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well and
 	
 	
 		well
 		let's see we're going to talk about uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> in college and how to help them
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">kids</ENAMEX>
 		how to pick <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> right
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		well it
 	
 	
 		and you've been through <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of those
 	
 	
 		uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah well i've been through once so
 	
 	
 		well if
 	
 	
 		how did you do it with your three
 	
 	
 		well with uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John</ENAMEX> the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> one he wanted to go into engineering so
 		uh
 		he had never really lived in a large <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> so we looked at good engineering <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> in relatively small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Purdue</ENAMEX>
 		in uh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lafayette Indiana</ENAMEX> we looked at uh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clemson</ENAMEX> and VPI
 	
 	
 		where were you living back then
 	
 	
 		we were living in in north <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alabama</ENAMEX> at the time
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		and uh we looked at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mississippi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">State</ENAMEX> which was in a small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mississippi</ENAMEX> and uh finally settled on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Auburn</ENAMEX> which was in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alabama</ENAMEX> in the small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> of Auburn
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		we also wanted a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> that had a uh coop program
 		because uh he wanted to go into engineering and we thought that a coop program was a good way to get some experience at the same time
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so that was kind of how uh we finally settled on small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> and good engineering <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> with a coop program for him for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brian</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it that was kind of funny because he first started out thinking uh
 		that he wanted to go to a small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> that's what he thought when we lived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alabama</ENAMEX> and then he moved to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plano</ENAMEX> and went to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senior High</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		he figured if i can go to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senior High i</ENAMEX> can go to school any place
 	
 	
 		yeah i i think there's a lot of that when you go to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two thousand</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> there
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		suddenly a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">college</ENAMEX> that's small seems i'm going backwards
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		so he ended up
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		uh i don't remember what his original major was because he changed it <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about three</NUMEX> times
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A&M</ENAMEX> but he ended up going to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A&M i</ENAMEX> think because of
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh he just thoroughly enjoyed the uh the atmosphere down there when he went down for a trip
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh he was sold on the place
 		Jana i think wanted to to stick a little closer to home
 		and really didn't have a major when she went in in fact
 		i think that was somewhat of a a default because her grades were not as good as uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brian</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">John's</ENAMEX> in high school so she was somewhat limited in her in her choices to places like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen F</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Texas</ENAMEX> and maybe <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTA</ENAMEX> and uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		she had some idea that she might want to uh
 		do something with uh physical therapy and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWU</ENAMEX> was also up in uh in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Denton</ENAMEX> so if she started at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> she could move to the other and might not even have to move out of her apartment
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so it was kind of close to home and there were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> that uh she could commute back and forth between the two
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		how did uh
 		your gal picked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baylor</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		well i think it was
 		well a little bit of
 		she narrowed it pretty rapidly to eliminate the real big ones <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> and A&M
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and then it kind of got to be a combination of what she thought she wanted to do and uh
 		the uh quality of the program it it you know <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baylor</ENAMEX> was kind of always at the lead there for uh for some time
 		uh she looked at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Austin College</ENAMEX>
 		i think she applied at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trinity</ENAMEX> but she really wasn't applying at any of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> schools
 	
 	
 		oh what's her major
 	
 	
 		um accounting
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so it was a bit of of the major but not a whole lot there's a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">campuses</ENAMEX> have business <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">majors</ENAMEX> so that was not a big deal for her
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		but she just uh it was sort of her choice and i think it was a little bit of we visited there and she visited some because her high school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boyfriend</ENAMEX>'s sister was there so she had spent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">some time</TIMEX> there and
 	
 	
 		i see
 	
 	
 		felt pretty comfortable she she looked at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Austin College</ENAMEX> but i think again it was the the size aspect it was just too small for somebody
 		coming from <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Plano</ENAMEX> unless you you really felt you needed something smaller
 	
 	
 		good one in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Plano</ENAMEX> yeah
 		yeah
 		what is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baylor</ENAMEX> i don't even know
 	
 	
 		so its
 		uh about uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eleven thousand</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh is it okay
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		so it's uh it's sizeable but it's
 		it's sort of in the not giant size
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah not like uh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Austin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">College Station</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah in the case of your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> that i i guess with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jennifer</ENAMEX> it was more
 		uh that
 		she was making her own choice which i kind of feel is one of the keys if they're going to go do it they better they better decide where with uh
 	
 	
 		yeah it needs to be a place they want to go
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh if they're going to be successful if they think <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mom</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dad</ENAMEX> picked it or they're going there because that's where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mom</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dad</ENAMEX> went and that's what they want them to do uh that's the wrong reason for picking a place
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that's kind of the way <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brian</ENAMEX> picked his first major i think he
 		without asking me he thought because i was in computer science that he should do the same thing and so he started out in that arena and didn't really care for it and finally asked if i would mind if he changed and i said
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		not at all because you you want to find something that you like to do not necessarily what your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dad</ENAMEX> does
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so uh
 	
 	
 		definitely
 	
 	
 		he felt a little easier about that after uh after i told him it wouldn't upset me at all if he found something that he wanted to do rather then copy what i did
 	
 	
 		yeah well it seems uh i don't know of a whole bunch of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> who uh really do what their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> did there's some i think <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> may be a place where and i don't know quite why
 		that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sons</ENAMEX> often follow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dad</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		into the profession and maybe that's some of it takes <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dad</ENAMEX>'s pull to get an in and other  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX> can't get in as easily
 	
 	
 		well that could be
 	
 	
 		but uh i don't have any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> who want to become <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineers</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh
 		so uh
 		you just kind of live with it
 	
 	
 		sure
 		well and they they need to do something that they think they will enjoy
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		uh like i told <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jana</ENAMEX> once she finally settled on a major she just did so much better in college than she did in high school once she found something to get excited about
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh whether she ever makes a lot of money at it or not is is immaterial if she enjoys it and is good at it
 		and uh so far i think she is
 	
 	
 		yeah well that's the key to it is that enjoying what you're doing and uh you know i think the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX> i see having more trouble picking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">colleges</ENAMEX> are
 		i got some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> who at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Arco</ENAMEX> there who uh well they're from back east and uh
 		and uh their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> are are looking in on some of those eastern private schools
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		when you start looking at the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty to thirty thousand</TIMEX> dollar price tag and you
 	
 	
 		oh i know it
 	
 	
 		start saying well do you really have to go there to get what you want
 	
 	
 		that's right i mean it would be nice if you could but you you can be successful without necessarily having a uh a degree from an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eastern</ENAMEX> school
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		but they're from back east and they got a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> there so it's uh
 		some of them do that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		well they feel some uh some peer pressure from their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peers</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> do sometimes
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
