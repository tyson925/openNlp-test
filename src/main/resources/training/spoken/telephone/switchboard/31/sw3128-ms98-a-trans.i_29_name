 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">uh Christ United Methodist</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		well of course i'm the little short one that sits on the end by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judy Dillon</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh okay i'm in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soprano</ENAMEX> parts
 	
 	
 		you're a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soprano</ENAMEX> well i well we can chitchat easily without any sweat then
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		what a hoot i i'd forgotten about this thing i have been so bad oh good
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well i have too i have too and i
 	
 	
 		obviously it's working now i should
 	
 	
 		oh i guess so i've only had uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> other chance at this thing and
 	
 	
 		i will do better
 		well okay <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leslie</ENAMEX> what are we gonna discuss <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leslie</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		we're supposed to discuss food and cooking
 	
 	
 		fine
 	
 	
 		and uh did it describe it to you at all
 	
 	
 		well it i was hunting for all of my stuff and every time i pressed a button they were already talking by the time my phone clicked back in
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i have a cordless phone that doesn't do well
 	
 	
 		okay well and it says uh which <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> would you recommend for uh a menu for a dinner party
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and then maybe we can share a recipe with what they kind of what it kind of said
 	
 	
 		great we can do that i don't care what you serve i'll let you go first you're in charge of the call you ready to press one
 	
 	
 		uh yeah
 		okay let
 		i'm pressing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> right now okay
 	
 	
 		go
 	
 	
 		okay well i was thinking about if i did a dinner party right now i'd do a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican Mexican</ENAMEX> fare of sorts because that's about the only thing i'm creative at and uh
 	
 	
 		what kind of things would you put on it
 	
 	
 		well for appetizers i'd start with the you know the typical cheese nachos and uh melt the cheese over the chips and uh put some green pepper or i mean chili peppers on top of that for those who like it hot
 		and then another good good um recipe for appetizers is uh bean dip i don't know if you've ever done that but you put just the uh refried <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beans</ENAMEX> and then a layer of uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		of sour cream
 	
 	
 		oh that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> layer dip
 	
 	
 		well it doesn't really have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">layers mine</ENAMEX> doesn't anyway and then i put like a layer of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cheese</ENAMEX> and then some salsa on top of everything and then you just use it for dipping your chip into  and
 	
 	
 		okay
 		okay you
 		that's a wonderful recipe
 	
 	
 		yeah it's real good and then a
 	
 	
 		what would you use for your main course
 	
 	
 		probably go with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fajitas</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		uh season up some good <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chicken</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beef</ENAMEX> and chop up a whole bunch of things so that they could kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pick</ENAMEX> and choose what they like and
 	
 	
 		that's an easy way to please everybody
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		that way if there's something that they don't want then they can just simply leave it off on their own
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		that's a good idea
 	
 	
 		so i haven't done many dinner parties though lately  i've just been uh
 	
 	
 		well i'm a very casual informal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> so most of my quote dinner parties
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		would probably be very laid back we'd probably do ribs or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chicken</ENAMEX> or
 		something like that on the grill put with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">corn</ENAMEX> on the cob and maybe a tossed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salad</ENAMEX> fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX> that type of a thing
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i'm a i'm a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lover</ENAMEX> of paper plates in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX> time and disposable plastic forks throw them away for an easy cleanup
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so i
 		i'm afraid i'm not a real fancy sit down kind of use your best china
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		dinner party kind
 	
 	
 		yeah that's me too
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		in fact we don't even have our dining table yet so i guess we've been pretty casual for most of everything so
 	
 	
 		well my life is kind of casual so my dinner <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> would be also
 	
 	
 		well speaking of dinner <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> are we still doing this uh  um
 	
 	
 		well what's a good potluck for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> what do you
 	
 	
 		yeah we
 		you know what i was planning on doing i didn't know if it was needed but was a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salad</ENAMEX>
 		i mean that's i didn't know if it had to be a casserole of sorts
 	
 	
 		it can be anything
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		it can be anything i  i may just bring fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX> because i know everybody will eat that even though it's not
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		you know someone'll bring a meat
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		if not
 		we go meatless i don't care yeah we don't we don't we eat too meach too much <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meat</ENAMEX> at dinner parties anyhow
 	
 	
 		that's right yeah it's kind a
 		yeah yeah well that's that's my my love of if i'm not going to have a full meal is to make sure i get a good <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salad</ENAMEX> in there and a good you know thing of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX> and that that'll satisfy most anybody so
 	
 	
 		i think they always go over well
 	
 	
 		yeah  okay how long we supposed to talk on <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this about three minutes</TIMEX> i hope
 	
 	
 		i think we've probably discussed all they need to discuss
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah okay well then if we're done it's all we do is just say good-bye right well
 	
 	
 		okay i've enjoyed talking to you and i if i have a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> dinner at anytime i'll do i think i'll run your yours by and have <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fajitas</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bean</ENAMEX> dip and the whole <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">nine yards</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah i'll get
 		
 
 		yeah yeah sounds good nice talking to you  bye-bye
 	
 	
 		okay i've enjoyed talking to you bye
