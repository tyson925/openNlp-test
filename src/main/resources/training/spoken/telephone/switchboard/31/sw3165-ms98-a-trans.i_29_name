 		i got my <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> accent
 	
 	
 		we don't have uh i grew up in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Jersey</ENAMEX> but it's been a long time since i lived there
 		did you already push the one okay um yeah we have fish that's it
 	
 	
 		yes
 		that's pretty easy
 	
 	
 		yeah it's uh
 		uh uh neither my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> or i really wanted to take care of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> or anything like that so
 		and the girls kind of wanted something we have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> uh well now we have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> when we got the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> to start with we had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two or three</NUMEX> but um
 	
 	
 		what the
 	
 	
 		for some reason i just decided to start a fish <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tank</ENAMEX> and set up a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> gallon fish <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tank</ENAMEX> and
 		it started with the some uh we had a real hard time getting it established tried the goldfish and they were just filthy could not keep the tank clean um
 		eventually i took them back to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX> and started started all over again and
 		i had another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kinds</ENAMEX> that ate each other so that bunch didn't work either
 	
 	
 		
 
 		what type were they like sicklets and stuff like that
 	
 	
 		um  there were some neons and a couple of other kind i can't remember what they were
 	
 	
 		i don't know if the
 	
 	
 		but but they didn't get along very well whatever they were
 	
 	
 		i i had <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> that were like they were called sicklets a type of family this is when i was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX> they they had um
 		what are they called like oscars and uh i forgot the different names that they had but they would eat eat they would actually they ate when they got big enough they would eat goldfish we would buy goldfish and feed them to them
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		huh
 		well these were not supposed to be an aggressive kind like that but they were
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and uh they i could see them picking on each other
 	
 	
 		yeah i i agree with that i i i um
 		i don't really wanna deal with any other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pets</ENAMEX> except for stuff like <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> i i thought about i've often thought about getting a fish <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tank</ENAMEX> but even that's too much work for me
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah anyway i finally got rid of those those all killed each other off and i cleaned the tank up again and got it all fixed again and so established and i got <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about half a dozen</NUMEX> guppies from a friend
 		and they just bred and bred and bred and they're uh there must've been <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred</NUMEX> guppies in that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">tank</ENAMEX> and i had i took i must've taken <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">forty</NUMEX> of them at a time back to the store <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two or three</NUMEX> different times
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		because there were so many of them i couldn't keep them down but
 	
 	
 		and what did they do they they just took them back
 	
 	
 		they took them back and gave me a credit of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about a dollar</NUMEX> each time
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		really yeah that's
 	
 	
 		so yeah helped to buy fish food and filters
 	
 	
 		yeah that's what my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> used to do with his other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> he used to sell them back to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX>  they'd buy them but uh that's cool that's
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		but but but uh then i i i i went for a while where um while i was pregnant with  our new little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> we uh i i just
 		kept forgetting to clean the fish <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tank</ENAMEX> and it was really dirty for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a long time</TIMEX> but those fish still lived in there and um
 		finally i cleaned the tank out and most of them had disappeared  um and i don't think i've got any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> in there anymore so they're not multiplying anymore
 	
 	
 		that's easier
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i need to get a new um
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">algae</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">eater</ENAMEX> though
 	
 	
 		do you do you still you still have guppies
 	
 	
 		yep there's still there's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about a dozen</NUMEX> guppies in there right now
 	
 	
 		so you you stayed with the guppies
 		great great yeah the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> are fun
 	
 	
 		so but that's the only thing we've got  yes you may i know  sorry and and so you have fish or do you have
 	
 	
 		no i i used to have fish when i was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but you don't have anything right now
 	
 	
 		but i don't have anything now i i guess when i moved out of my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> i uh gave my <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> to my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> tank i think i gave to someone else
 		um but i thought <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few years ago</TIMEX> go and get one but i've moved around so much recently
 	
 	
 		yeah it's kind of a problem moving them
 	
 	
 		yeah they're not that easy but although it like living in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York City</ENAMEX> there's definitely no other pet that you would want i mean <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have cats some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have dogs i mean i've i've even seen big big <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> in small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartments</ENAMEX> and i don't really see that
 	
 	
 		you feel sorry for them
 	
 	
 		yeah someday if i move out into the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> i like it like a you know like a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Labrador</ENAMEX> or something like that some you know bigger <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> that could kind of run around outside and stuff
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but yeah you see these big dog i mean i see this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> in my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> with some i think it's like a golden retriever or something like that and he he's good though he takes him out all the time or her out all the time
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		you'd have to do it an awful lot though
 	
 	
 		yeah this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> he seems like he runs and stuff and runs with the dog so he probably gets in enough exercise
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but you know lot
