 
     		
 	
 		i'm <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Doug</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		hi how you doing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Doug</ENAMEX> my name's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brad</ENAMEX> where where you from
 	
 	
 		from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh okay i'm from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah okay so anyway now we're talking about drug testing an all that and you ready okay  so what do you think about it
 	
 	
 		right right
 		yep okay
 		oh i definitely i i think it shouldn't be if it may be the only exception is when there's public safety involved you know <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bus</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drivers</ENAMEX> uh train <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX> motormen stuff like that you know
 	
 	
 		right right i agree with you basically so might be a boring conversation  but um but anyway i agree that
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		um only when there's any question of safety does the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employer</ENAMEX> have a right because otherwise i feel that
 		the measure of whether someone is to stay employed or not it is just performance whether you're able to do the job up to par and
 		that and if that can be done it shouldn't matter whatever the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX> might do in his private life
 	
 	
 		yes um you're right it's probably is gonna be boring i agree with you a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundred</NUMEX> percent
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		uh you know but i i i think that uh i mean <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> think that they have an interest in in finding things like this out about their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employers</ENAMEX> because it's
 		probably and and maybe it's true that that if if you if you tested <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and if they were drug users
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		probably  i mean i might even agree with you that they're probably gonna to be less productive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> um i'm not sure about that but i would say that that that may be that might be a good indication
 	
 	
 		yeah that
 		well probably at least on the average
 	
 	
 		but but you could also you might be able to tell by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>'s uh you know whether they're overweight or underweight
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh you know you might make certain  value judgments about that you can make value judgments probably about about a number of different things that are clearly within the realm of someone's private ability
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know private you know private interest or or you know i'm trying looking for a word  in other words you know maybe maybe uh heavier <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		tend to not be as good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> you know or maybe maybe extra uh uh ultra thin <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> tend to not be as good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> maybe <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that smoke cigarettes  aren't as good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> uh you know
 	
 	
 		right certainly and certainly in any case <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who drink alcohol a lot are probably not as good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> i think that most drug testing programs don't include that
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		they're really interested in looking for illegal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> it seems to be more for the purpose of law enforcement than for
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		the purpose of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employer</ENAMEX>'s best interest for the job
 	
 	
 		that's true that's true
 	
 	
 		yeah um
 	
 	
 		so  we could talk about <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pets</ENAMEX> that was my last subject you know
 	
 	
 		oh  i see um
 		well we're supposed
 	
 	
 		what's that music in the background
 	
 	
 		uh that's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miles Davis</ENAMEX> yeah
 	
 	
 		oh okay a little tribute to him or
 	
 	
 		uh right exactly it's on the radio
 		um so
 	
 	
 		ah
 		that's a good background for this conversation  all right well anyhow nice talking to you i i don't think we have to stay on the whole time and we've we've agreed too much
 	
 	
 		anyway
 		right
 		okay
 		yeah i guess not and i think we've said about what we have to say sure thing bye bye
 	
 	
 		okay take care  have <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a good day</TIMEX> bye bye
