 
     		
 	
 		uh i work at <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> and we have um of course started drug testing um  random drug testing here and um i haven't gotten called yet but um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i feel that it's probably pretty it's pretty good
 		if if they feel like there is a vast majority of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> doing drugs
 	
 	
 		do they feel that way
 	
 	
 		um i think that they thought that there was a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> usage here at <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> but i think our latest statistic statistic said something like <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ninety nine</NUMEX> point
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nine</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">eight percent</NUMEX> were uh testing negative on all the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> on on all the testing
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		well i i think it's a good idea just because i'm opposed to to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> i think it can cause a lot of problems even though they think they can handle it it's uh i don't know i don't really liken it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		to alcohol but yet that can be carried to an extreme too so i think it's a good idea and i think just the idea that you know that you may be tested might keep you off of them or get you off of them because you're
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		right
 	
 	
 		i don't know that their job would be at risk because i think they may put them into some sort of a
 		program to get them off of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> i would think that is that how they do it at <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> maybe that
 	
 	
 		right
 		
 
 		right i at <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> if you get called in and you test positive for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> then you're put on a program and um you know you go through the program and then
 		you're called like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six months</TIMEX> after you complete the program program and if you test positive then you're terminated
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		well
 		
 
 		i guess i i draw a hard line but you know i would i'm i'm in favor of of that type of thing that um
 	
 	
 		yeah uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you  you have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> out there that are responsible for certain things and you expect them to do their job and it it is possible that you know that they can't do as good a job um as they might do
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		that's right
 		um-hum oh and of course they can also cause injury to other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> if they're if they're not uh you know fully functional
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		mentally while they're doing their job they could cause you know serious injury to other another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> um-hum
 	
 	
 		right and you never know they could just go off the deep end on on a on something uh that  whatever they're taking at the time and and it would be uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know out of the question also i guess you can you know get the wrong kind of stuff and kill yourself just by having a wrong mix of or watered down or or whatever all kinds i sub in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>  so i've you know had a
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		that's right
 		oh yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		so  right
 	
 	
 		they they talk a lot about <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> there and i think it's good that they're trying to start some programs down in the elementary schools
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but you know i think they can test all they want for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>  you know and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 		if they need to do that as a condition for employment and i know many of them are doing it i know my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> has had to do it for both <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam</ENAMEX>'s and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wal-Mart</ENAMEX> and i don't know how many others are
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		doing that and and i think that's good because  so many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> that are on them are sort of bums that they need to get their life straightened up at an early age and uh
 	
 	
 		oh yes um-hum
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		i don't know it's just a problem that problem no one is sure just how to handle i think
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		you know i think personally i'm for it there's
 		several reason why i i could think of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">right now</TIMEX> why we shouldn't have it such as drug testing they say runs <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">approximately a thousand dollars</NUMEX> a person every time you do it
 	
 	
 		really it's that high
 	
 	
 		and yes and oh yeah it's very expensive and um um-hum it's not like a normal urinalysis it's very expensive to run them and um
 	
 	
 		oh
 		i didn't realize it was that expensive
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i didn't get a raise <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> because nobody in our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> got a raise
 	
 	
 		um-hum just lucky to have jobs
 	
 	
 		but yet their they spend all the money on drug testing and if they weren't spending all the money on drug testing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> could have got a raise so see there you know there's different
 		i don't think that that's that i think that's more of a personal view of mine other than a a yes sir we should have drug testing because there's really a problem and i know that but then i have other views to it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		i just i didn't think it was that expensive because my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> was in probably <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a week</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a half</TIMEX> period and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam</ENAMEX>'s and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wal-Mart</ENAMEX> are are
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		owned by the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> he took <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> for for uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wal-Mart</ENAMEX> for job hiring and then <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam</ENAMEX>'s called him and and  he took another <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> and i you know i don't know why they both
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		right
 	
 	
 		made him do that since it was so close together i can see if
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		because you know if it's a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">thousand dollars</NUMEX> that's a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">thousand dollars</NUMEX> they wasted
 	
 	
 		their their's might not run <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a thousand</NUMEX> dollars our from what i understanding here at <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> they run close to a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">thousand dollars</NUMEX> an employee
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well maybe they run i don't know you know that's just guessing it maybe they run a lot of other tests or maybe it's under a health
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		type program that it it it would catch a lot of things i i just can't imagine them screening all these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> paying a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">thousand dollars</NUMEX> to get them
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		but no for all the the
 		oh it's
