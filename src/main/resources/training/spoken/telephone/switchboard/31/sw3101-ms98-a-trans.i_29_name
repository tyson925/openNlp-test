 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay do you have a boat
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		do you like to boat oh yeah
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		yeah i went and saw boat <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> i about flipped over it
 	
 	
 		what kind
 	
 	
 		i'm not i'm not sure what kind it was i saw it just sitting on the side of the road
 	
 	
 		oh a ski <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> though
 	
 	
 		yeah oh yeah no doubt about it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		we have a seventeen foot invader
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and yeah it's we've only had it <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of years</TIMEX> but it's so much better than the other boat we had a an older trihold that was just horrible because i mean God you felt every wave
 		but the uh the invader is really neat i really like it it's got the bow up and the bow down and all that stuff so it's kind of fun
 	
 	
 		that sounds neat
 	
 	
 		yeah so we ski every weekend
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well at least you have <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekends</TIMEX> off
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		we didn't i think i'd go nuts
 	
 	
 		oh i know i know i don't have that luxury yet
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yeah i am in the restaurant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">business</ENAMEX> i run <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> and uh didn't really don't really have that time off yet so
 	
 	
 		oh
 		yeah that would be difficult where did you see the boat
 	
 	
 		it was out out in  out in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Garland</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh well there's been <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> sitting up in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Addison</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last few days</TIMEX> that's really neat it's a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baja</ENAMEX> but it's huge
 		i think it'd be more <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> than i'd want right now
 	
 	
 		yeah this one's big too
 	
 	
 		huh well eventually my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> thinks that we are going to sell everything that we own and live on a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh that'd be great
 	
 	
 		yeah i think we'd kill each other
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i think i could probably handle that
 	
 	
 		well i think i could for awhile i do not know but yeah
 	
 	
 		for awhile
 	
 	
 		but i'd i mean i'd have to get away from him eventually but another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> of mine has said that he and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> are going to do that and he said that they're just planning to take their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bikes</ENAMEX> and then go into <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX> every once in a while and
 		say see you later and take off and he said that they thought they could keep their sanity that way
 	
 	
 		well that'd be great
 	
 	
 		yeah i do not know if i could live on a boat
 	
 	
 		who cares about sanity though
 	
 	
 		well i know what could make you insane floating around in the middle of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i know it no telephone no fax machines nothing nothing
 	
 	
 		exactly
 		well that's another thing good thing about our <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> is going out on the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekends</TIMEX> at least we are forced to talk to each other and there's nothing to interrupt us and it's just so relaxing
 	
 	
 		oh that's true
 	
 	
 		so even if we do not ski but now that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> is warm enough we have been skiing a lot and my little <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven year</TIMEX> nephew is coming <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next week</TIMEX> so i guess i will have to teach him how to ski
 	
 	
 		well that's good
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> that's about the right age
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah i think that's about when i learned
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		do you ski
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		oh yeah do you have your own ski and everything
 	
 	
 		yeah i sure do
 	
 	
 		oh yeah it's a lot of fun my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> has a wet suit so he can ski pretty much year around if he if he has the guts to
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but uh it was really neat <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last weekend</TIMEX> we were sitting out in the in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> and a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a</NUMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> of shad came bebopping across the water and he threw the line out and caught a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> cast
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yeah that was really neat i had never seen the shad do that so that was pretty cool
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		so anyway
 	
 	
 		that's kind of different
 	
 	
 		yeah i was amazed
 	
 	
 		yeah i kind of i kind of enjoyed that boat i looked at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> it's nice and clean it wasn't yeah it was not that old
 	
 	
 		really did it have a cabin
 	
 	
 		no it didn't it's open open up front had a little and it was open in the back too in the back kind of had a little
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		deck in the back of it also
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yeah it was kind of different i thought
 	
 	
 		huh
 		it must've been pretty big
 	
 	
 		yeah it was
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		rather large i do not know how big it was or anything i was just looking at it and until i got around to the for sale sign
 	
 	
 		how much was it
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fourteen thousand</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh my i wonder how old it was was it very old
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh pardon me
 		no it couldn't have been that old it's
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">huh</ENAMEX> was it inboard outboard
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you don't know how big the engine was
 	
 	
 		no i did not even i did not even look at it i got around the price tag and said okay
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i said that's enough
 	
 	
 		yeah well ours will be paid off in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ninety three</NUMEX> and i will feel like i hit the lottery then i guess but
 	
 	
 		yeah i know it
 	
 	
 		it's pretty nice it's nice to have it's a good way to get away <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kyle</ENAMEX> is afraid that he doesn't want me to to pull it by myself yet but the way our drive way is there's like a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">forty five</NUMEX> degree turn so i do not think i could get it out even if i wanted to
 	
 	
 		um where do you all where do you all go skiing
 	
 	
 		we go to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lewisville</ENAMEX> and but it's really nice i mean we've talked about getting the the slip so that if after work if i wanted to go out and play around in the boat i would have plenty of time because now it does not get dark until <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">nine o'clock</TIMEX> but
 	
 	
 		oh i know it
 	
 	
 		it's really nice having it in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garage</ENAMEX> because then if we want to go to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whitney</ENAMEX> or you know <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">Grapevine</ENAMEX> or any other place it's just there and we can load up and go
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true
 	
 	
 		so plus i don't have any idea how much slip rental is it probably probably get a little expensive i would think
 	
 	
 		uh somebody was talking about that at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time they were talking about uh
 		was it <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one hundred</NUMEX> fifty a month
 	
 	
 		whoa
 	
 	
 		something <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty a hundred twenty a hundred</TIMEX> fifty a month oh i know it
 	
 	
 		i think i'll keep it in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garage</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 		that's outrageous
 	
 	
 		well it yeah it is and
 	
 	
 		just to have a place to park you boat
 	
 	
 		yeah especially on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> even
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		with some wood going around it
 	
 	
 		that's pretty wild
 	
 	
 		yeah ev <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">erybody</ENAMEX>'s got to make a buck though
 	
 	
 		oh that's true
 	
 	
 		the name of the game i think
 	
 	
 		well that's what we were coming back from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arkansas</ENAMEX> i guess <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last October</TIMEX> and there was a marina for sale
 		and he said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">now</TIMEX> that would be a fun job
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but yeah i can probably do that for a while
 	
 	
 		working around the working around the water and take off on the boat anytime you wanted to
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah you know hang out the gone fishing sign
 	
 	
 		yeah  in it's truest sense right
 	
 	
 		really
 		i do not know a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> say <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boats</ENAMEX> are just a hole in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> that you pour money into but we've been real fortunate we have not had any problems
 		so but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kyle</ENAMEX>'s real good with the maintenance i think that that's real important so fortunately he knows what he is doing there
 	
 	
 		well that's good does he know how to work on them or just minor stuff
 	
 	
 		well just the minor stuff uh we took it in for its <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">hundred hour</NUMEX> check up and all that stuff but you got to do stuff like that to keep the warranties good
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		so that's fine i can live with that
 	
 	
 		took took it in and got it got all of its shots right
 	
 	
 		yeah  it's kind of like our only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> now
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right
 	
 	
 		well hopefully someday you will get that dream <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		oh i know it or that time off <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the two
 	
 	
 		yeah really yeah you kind of need need them to go hand in hand i guess
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah it helps it helps
 	
 	
 		yeah because i mean i there's times you know even our <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekends</TIMEX> where we don't have time to go and it's sad because you think God you are paying all that money for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> and it's just sitting there
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh i know it
 	
 	
 		so but it's well worth it when we do get to go and hopefully it will be good weather <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this weekend</TIMEX> so we can go
 	
 	
 		man it's supposed to be
 	
 	
 		i hope so
 		well i enjoyed talking to you okay maybe i will get you again sometime all right bye-bye
 	
 	
 		myself
 		all right take care
 		bye-bye
