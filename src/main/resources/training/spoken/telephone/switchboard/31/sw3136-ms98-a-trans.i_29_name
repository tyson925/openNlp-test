 
     		
 	
 		okay i i guess <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of all i'll just say we haven't done much uh gardening we do lawn work all the time but uh our gardening we lost remember the last <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> freezes i don't know how long you've been here
 	
 	
 		yeah i do
 	
 	
 		but we lost our <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">bushes</ENAMEX> in those and have been waiting to plant new ones and so as far as our bushes we don't have any
 		but we do have some blackberry <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">bushes</ENAMEX> and and they were really hearty and stayed on and we've done really well with them
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		did you plant those yourself
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah and so they've been really good and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> i had to  <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first year</TIMEX> i had to tell the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> not to pick them when they were red because they were supposed to be blackberries
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		but uh we go out it it's hard to go out when it's this hot
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh but uh keep the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">weeds</ENAMEX> out of them and and keep them off the ground so the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ants</ENAMEX> don't eat them and they're okay
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		yeah um
 	
 	
 		that's nice i i love blackberries and we we uh when i was smaller we my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> lived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tennessee</ENAMEX> and there used to be wild blackberries that we'd go out and pick my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> and i
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but i don't have any down here
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah uh we have some <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> that have they just are real hearty also and they're bulbs and they come up <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every year</TIMEX>
 		but uh they're getting too thick i need to go thin them out
 		and uh
 		there a i don't know what kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> they are they're real common around here they're they're orange and they look like a <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">lily</ENAMEX> sort of uh
 	
 	
 		oh i think i know what they i can't remember what the name of them is are are either
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		no but i think they're real pretty when it rains because their petals don't soak the rain in they they keep the the rain on the outside little rain drops and and they look real pretty after the rain
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and so i really like them but i need to get out and and um  do that now as far as our grass it grows
 		crazy  it just keeps growing and growing
 		and uh sometimes my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> does it and sometimes my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> does it but it just is
 		i don't i don't know i've lived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Utah</ENAMEX> my whole life and we can't seem to get ours green i don't know yeah
 	
 	
 		down here the grass
 		well i'm uh we've had problems with our yard we it was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> big <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">weed</ENAMEX> is what it was it was just horrible and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> on either side of me have beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">lawns</ENAMEX> and we have this God awful ugly thing and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		crappy  i know we have that too
 	
 	
 		and i know they must think  you know i wish those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> would do something about their yard but my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> got some new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fertilizer</ENAMEX> and stuff that
 		that seems to be helping and he put it on the front yard to see how you know it would do and stuff before he put it on the backyard but we've got a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Great Dane</ENAMEX> in the back and she has eaten everything i have put out there she's eaten my crepe <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">myrtle trees</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh dear
 	
 	
 		i know and she's eaten the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">bushes</ENAMEX> i've tried to i spent like <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">eight hours</TIMEX> planting this nice garden out there and i barricaded it up so she couldn't get into it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		no  uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i went and took a shower and looked back out there and she was already in it and i was so mad
 	
 	
 		had somehow gotten in  yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		so i can't do anything back there because she just she destroys it
 		but i've tried out in the front but like you said that that freeze that came
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i had some <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">bushes</ENAMEX> that uh some shrubs i put put out front and it killed those too so i'm just real discouraged with the whole thing i just don't even want to do anything
 	
 	
 		the the other problem that we have well it's funny because the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> the two <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">bushes</ENAMEX> on the ends of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> that i think are ugly they lived
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and so i don't i don't know
 	
 	
 		i yeah that that happened to us we have these
 	
 	
 		uh so like i wanted to go out and kill them too
 	
 	
 		i know
 	
 	
 		they had no right to live but anyway
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh under our trees we get a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a</NUMEX> north sun and uh the it looks like our <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> don't have any grass under them you know we just can't grow uh grass underneath there
 	
 	
 		oh i know ours don't
 		i know we can't either but i've got pretty <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> good size cottonwood <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> out in my front yard uh you know one on either side of the yard
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and and they're big and  they're real full and everything you know in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX> time but it it's killing everything underneath
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		where the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">leaves</ENAMEX> are shading the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> but
 		toward <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the summer</TIMEX> you know when everything starts dying off and whatnot and then the light can get through the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> then the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">grass</ENAMEX> starts growing but by then it's so late then <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the winter</TIMEX> comes and it stops you know it's it's it's a never ending cycle
 	
 	
 		right
 		it's a vicious cycle isn't it it's really
 	
 	
 		yeah it really is so we've been trying to get something or to pull some grass underneath there and and whatnot so
 	
 	
 		well i don't we've never done anything like this but we've been thinking you know if we built up um
 		you know either a a wood wooden like trench thing around where our <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">bushes</ENAMEX> were and filled it like with a nice dirt then maybe we could plant some either <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> or or some new <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">bushes</ENAMEX> in there that would live
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and so i think that we're going to try that i i think the
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		i think that's pretty much what we have decided now i have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> long windows and i'm trying to decide whether to put like <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">bushes</ENAMEX> in front of them or not you know maybe just halfway up the window or something like that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> can't see and hear too much  it just
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		really and i've cut well i don't really have to worry about that that much because my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sons</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedrooms</ENAMEX> are in the front
 		and they've got <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mini-blinds</ENAMEX> and stuff but only <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> is really like in the flower bed part and the other one is out on the porch
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so there's not really much i can do about that
 	
 	
 		that's what our <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> are on the front too with these long windows one is a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedroom</ENAMEX> for our our oldest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> and one is um
 		an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> that my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> and i work in
 		and so i i really don't like it too much because then the back of our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX> faces that well the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> are out by the back of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> so and that's where the front <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> is
 		so that's not too bad but i like to look at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> they're pretty
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i do too that's why i look at my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> yard  i don't have anything to look at so i look at theirs
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		but it's funny because uh you try so hard i think sometimes to to anyway i do to do our yard and then it's like the wind blows
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		everything whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">weeds</ENAMEX> from your <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">yard</ENAMEX> to your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> or yours to them or and so even if you did get it under control it seems like in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">just a few months</TIMEX> it would all be back and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah it it's really a pain my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> works a lot so um a lot
 	
 	
 		it's hard to get out a lot and do that yard work
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm it's usually me and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> that go out and mow the yard and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i just  i really do not appreciate having to go out there and do it i hate to mow the yard more than anything else i hate to mow that yard
 	
 	
 		i know it is it's not my favorite thing in the world either i'm glad i have an old enough <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> to do it for me now
 	
 	
 		yeah <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">well mine</ENAMEX>'s getting there he helps he does <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> and i do <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> so pretty soon though by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</TIMEX> he should be able to do it all by himself
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		whether he likes it or not
 	
 	
 		yeah  well that is one chore that we will pay him for if he'll go do the yard work out outside so
 	
 	
 		oh sure i'll be more then glad to pay him if he'd just go out there and do it and and do it to where i don't have to go back out and redo it that that's my only thing with him
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right exactly exactly
 	
 	
 		that's why i'm help having him help me now
