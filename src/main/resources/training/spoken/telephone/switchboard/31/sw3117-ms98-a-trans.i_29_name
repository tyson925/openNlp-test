 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay well having uh personally uh helped uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> attend or or to select <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">colleges</ENAMEX> one of them not very successfully
 		i'm not sure if i'm any authority on this topic at all
 	
 	
 		well which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">colleges</ENAMEX> did they go to
 	
 	
 		well a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> uh went to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Virginia</ENAMEX> that was a good selection she
 	
 	
 		that's a beautiful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> beautiful school
 	
 	
 		yeah really is and she was she was very very happy there and very and very successful in what she picked to do so uh she's just graduated from there so that was a good selection
 		uh our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> has this kind of you know he's
 		well he started out going <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen F Austin</ENAMEX> and that turned turned into you know flunking out because of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">of</NUMEX> of uh too many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> going on then he stayed out of school for a while then he went to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Richland</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of years</TIMEX> and then he went to
 		to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DePaul</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX> which would have been great but uh it was so expensive so now he's now he's back
 	
 	
 		well i guess the question then becomes how did you all make the selection or did you just let them do them by themselves
 	
 	
 		well in in that case with him uh he kind of made the selections by himself and i think that we should have given him more direction and
 		he was our first you know so we we didn't have quite the insight that uh that we would have had if he'd been our <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> like we did with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karen</ENAMEX> so uh
 		but i i think you know i just in terms of of what happened i think that <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of all i'd i would know the reputation of the school
 		and uh for more than just <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">academics</ENAMEX>  but you know if it's a party <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> or not although i think every <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>  is a party <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> to some degree personally
 	
 	
 		well that's true of course uh you know for me my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> he's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only six</NUMEX> and but i had the experience with my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> going to school and she was i treated my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> almost like my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> because she was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten years</TIMEX> younger than i was and it's
 	
 	
 		right
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		right
 	
 	
 		and she ended up going to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Oklahoma</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i can say that because it was a big well known school it had a well known education and it was a wonderful education but yet it was a small school
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right
 	
 	
 		whereas i went to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Texas</ENAMEX> which was you know <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> go there
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i think that for me it's going to be one of those things yes i want to make sure it has a good education but i also want to keep it small enough that you can enjoy it because <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> to me was almost too big
 	
 	
 		yeah i've heard that from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who have gone to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> yeah i went to uh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iowa</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">State</ENAMEX> which is also a big <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oklahoma</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it's way too big
 		yes yes i'm i'm quite aware
 	
 	
 		yeah and uh when i was there it was maybe <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eleven or twelve thousand</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> which was just a great size i thought it's it's
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> only had fifty <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">five thousand</NUMEX> when i was there
 	
 	
 		oh gosh  that's just awful
 	
 	
 		and for me i had to admit the one thing that i lacked was the uh interaction between uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> i knew everybody within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">my dorm</TIMEX> but that was it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh yeah</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> was just too big and whereas my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> when i went to visit her she knew everybody on the whole durn campus
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yes that that's true it makes a lot of difference and uh
 	
 	
 		so uh course now we're we're already telling our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> you know <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> uh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oklahoma</ENAMEX>'s good and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arkansas</ENAMEX> is good <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">now</TIMEX> of course <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> is good only because you know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		you went to school there yeah right uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i went because i went there of course but uh
 		we're going my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> let me choose on my own and i want to pretty much allow him to choose on his own but i kind of keep an ear open as to what he's doing
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		sure oh yeah yeah well our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> chose uh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX> because she didn't want to go to school in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> i mean she just sort of didn't want to go to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> here
 	
 	
 		well i was when i was in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Louisiana</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shreveport</ENAMEX> i would go to any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> except <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LSU i</ENAMEX> did not want to school in the in the same state
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah same deal
 		yeah and uh in fact she was accepted at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rice</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trinity</ENAMEX> but she decided she wanted to go out of state and uh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX> was uh you know in the east it wasn't a you know it wasn't an Ivy League <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> but it was well it's quite a bit further and it was uh
 		of the state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> that she could have gone to it was one of the cheapest yet one of the best too you know with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">academics</ENAMEX> and the tradition and everything that is there uh she made a really good selection we thought and
 		so uh she pretty much made that herself herself but she did have some others in the wings you know there's another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> that she she would have have gone to if she hadn't been accepted there
 		so uh  i don't know i think it really depends a lot on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> because our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> is was just a lot more levelheaded about her process the process
 	
 	
 		luckily i still have twelve <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more years</TIMEX> to worry about it
 	
 	
 		yeah  so uh but you know i guess you have to really look at your finances and uh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> has such a bargain in education i mean
 	
 	
 		right now they do now if the uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">legislature</ENAMEX> has their way they're going to raise the tuition in in double
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i know i know
 	
 	
 		and see back when i went to school there when i <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> entered the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> it cost me <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">two hundred dollars</NUMEX> as an out as an out of state student
 	
 	
 		uh that's something
 		uh
 	
 	
 		but then i was there for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about two and a half years</TIMEX> they then switched it to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">forty dollars</NUMEX> per semester hour so almost overnight i went from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">two hundred dollars</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">eight hundred dollars</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 		my gosh
 	
 	
 		and i have to admit uh
 	
 	
 		that was a shocker
 	
 	
 		i wasn't i wasn't quite ready for that one
 	
 	
 		no i'll bet not
 	
 	
 		it took me only about twelve <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> after i graduated to finish paying off the bill but that's
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah yeah i know how that is
 	
 	
 		but at least i was one of the good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> i did pay my bill off in full yes i did yeah
 	
 	
 		you did pay yours good yeah my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> went to school on loans too and and we he was able you know we paid his off after we were married but uh well i'm at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">university</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> and as a graduate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> and uh
 		you know i have to say that uh it's a real bargain i mean for as far as i'm concerned it's been a real bargain of course you know living at home makes a lot of difference if i had to to pay <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> and board somewhere that would make a lot of difference uh in
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well what about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Virginia</ENAMEX> how much did it end end up costing
 	
 	
 		uh  i think uh on a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yearly</TIMEX> basis i'm trying to think i would just make it a rough figure of about
 		uh with with the travel expenses and so on although she didn't come home that much uh actually i would say between twelve and thirteen <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">thousand</NUMEX> a year
 	
 	
 		that's a long way
 		uh that's not too bad
 	
 	
 		it's not when you look at the you know the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> and the fact that she was
 	
 	
 		now did she get to did she get to live in the dorm on that very front row you know that goes up by the rotunda
 	
 	
 		uh no on the lawn no no that's that's an honor that's bestowed on very few and she didn't get to do that although she knew <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who did live there but yeah that's that would have been neat
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		
 
 		when we went to visit it we didn't know what it was and my little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX> he was opening every one of the mailboxes looking inside to see what he could find
 	
 	
 		well you know the graduation takes place right there on the lawn on on that in that big fat grassy area and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		they had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four thousand</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">graduates</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this spring</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> that was quite an event i'll tell you
 	
 	
 		yeah we went on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Blue Ridge Parkway</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> and we went to visit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">th</ENAMEX> at was the very last thing we saw was at the tail end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Parkway</ENAMEX> we had we had a blast
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		yeah
 		that's a great place to visit that really is yeah
 	
 	
 		it is it i can see why you want to go there that's
 	
 	
 		yeah well they're just so it's just steeped in tradition and and the uh you know they're they still talk about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mister Jefferson</ENAMEX> the you know i mean the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founder</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> of course was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mister Jefferson Thomas Jefferson</ENAMEX> and they and and a lot of
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh</ENAMEX> and of course you'v e got to go to say hello to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Monticello</ENAMEX> yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		right uh-huh and and a lot of the of his traditions i mean for instance they don't call the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students freshmen sophomore junior senior</ENAMEX> they call them <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">first year second year third year and fourth year</TIMEX> because <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mister Jefferson</ENAMEX> felt that one's education never ended
 		and to you put those <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> designations of freshmen sophomore and so on on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>'s education limited them
 		and he felt that you could go on to school forever you should just have the number of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> that you were there attached to your name if you want to do identify someone so
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		i had to be very careful about talking about <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">seniors</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> year <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>  you got to get the terminology right
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well i tell you what i've enjoyed talking i'm going to go ahead and hang up on this end because it's just about time for supper so
 	
 	
 		yes
 		all righty
 		yes it certainly is i got to go make it here
 	
 	
 		actually it it was a fun conversation i enjoyed it
 	
 	
 		well i i this is my last one you're number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> that i can i
 	
 	
 		congratulations well congratulations
