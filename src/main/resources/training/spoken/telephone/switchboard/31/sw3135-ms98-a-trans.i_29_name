 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		okay do you have you ever had to put your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> in in child care <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Dell</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh yes i'm an old experienced hand i started back when it wasn't stylish to do that at all my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> that's seventeen now
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i worked even when she was a baby
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and i had private care for both my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughters</ENAMEX> until they were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> and then i was really lucky to have put them in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Methodist</ENAMEX> day <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Preston Hollow Methodist</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		right off of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Walnut Hill</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Preston</ENAMEX> and it was a wonderful environment i i just wish all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> if they have to be put in day <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> could have that kind of place
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		uh-huh i see
 	
 	
 		so it worked well how about you
 	
 	
 		oh well i have uh a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nine year old</TIMEX> and a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six year old</TIMEX> and neither one of them has ever been in in uh day care for the reason of of me working but uh they both went through preschool
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh  we've just been real lucky  i think anyway to not
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		it's not hard to find anything that's part-time so many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX> have really strong
 	
 	
 		right like <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">half day</TIMEX> programs uh-huh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">preschool</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>'s day out but it was a nightmare back when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheryl</ENAMEX> was little and this is one of the few <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX> that did it there were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a couple</NUMEX> downtown <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but they were so  seemed cold and impersonal i just couldn't hack it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and what i liked about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Preston Hollow</ENAMEX> is that
 		the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that were there when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheryl</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> which was fifteen <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX> many of them are still there <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> so there was real continuity she went back as a teenager and these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that had changed her diapers when she was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> were still there
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh my gosh
 	
 	
 		so it it was really neat but it was because they had a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> that had always done it as a labor of love and she just kept good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh my goodness
 	
 	
 		real cheerful place lots of arts and crafts and i'm really glad my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> had it because <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Plano</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> do so little of that
 	
 	
 		right right yeah
 	
 	
 		that if they hadn't had it before they hit <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> grade they were never going to have any art or music or any of the interpretive stuff
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah that is um a big drawback i think in that in the uh public <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> out here
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know to your lucky to have an art <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> and if you do  you get them once a week or something you know
 	
 	
 		or pay for it after school our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Emily's</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> grade over at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Huffman</ENAMEX> and they started a pilot program where we can pay private tuition so that they can take <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">French</ENAMEX> and music and art and
 	
 	
 		oh is that right i had no idea
 	
 	
 		you know i willingly did it but i thought this makes me angry this is something that ought to be in the schools
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh my goodness
 	
 	
 		rather than some of the other stuff they do yeah
 	
 	
 		and with our budget cuts i'm sure that's not going to
 	
 	
 		well that's the only way they're yeah that's the only way they're going to be able to do it and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> who really want their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> to have any humanities are going to have to do that so in some ways i think the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> schools do serve those purposes
 	
 	
 		not going to change anytime soon
 		oh my goodness
 		yeah that's true well even the preschools you know they get so much of that in preschool and then when they hit kindergarten
 		you know it's like wham  culture shock it's just
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah put the colors away  which is too bad
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah get the computers out and you know well that's hard it's so difficult for them um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		did you have your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> did you say in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> in in private care was that in your <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> or in someone else's home
 	
 	
 		until they were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> yeah yeah both times they were at our house
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh</ENAMEX> so you were able to have somebody come there
 	
 	
 		and that was hard too i i lucked out with really good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> both times but i know so many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that are never able to find that and i'd practically give my paycheck away to do it so  yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah did you have a nanny or did you have someone that lived in with you
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well no she didn't live with us uh the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> one was an elderly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX> who was putting a a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> through nursing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> just purely on babysitting money
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh my goodness
 	
 	
 		and she kept <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheryl</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> and then did  more babysitting at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> and she was neat because she was like the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandmother</ENAMEX> that my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> never had because both our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> are dead
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so that that was a plus from that respect as well and then with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Emily</ENAMEX> it was a neighborhood <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> that kept her so
 	
 	
 		oh gosh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh uh</ENAMEX>-huh i have uh a
 	
 	
 		i just cannot fathom putting a little bitty <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> in a commercial care center
 	
 	
 		uh-huh i was just listening to a program this morning oh well i guess it was on the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Home Show</ENAMEX> but they were talking about uh
 		a new uh  oh i can't even think of the name of it i was halfway listening while i was painting um it's some kind of advisory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> they've put together for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and they've now moved it to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DC</ENAMEX> and the the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> that was on there the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pediatrician</ENAMEX> said you know i can't imagine leaving a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three week old</TIMEX> and taking them to a nursery day care and leaving them there
 	
 	
 		yeah oh that would be hard
 	
 	
 		you know so um
 	
 	
 		well they give a lot more leave i work at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCNB</ENAMEX> now and our benefits for maternal and and parental care and even for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elderly people</ENAMEX> or
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		are really expanding we have more options now then we did when i my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> were born with being able to take off full-time longer of you can phase your schedule in so that it's not full-time
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> that's great
 	
 	
 		for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">up to six months</TIMEX> it's really neat i've i've had a couple of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assistants</ENAMEX> that came back just <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three days a week</TIMEX> or they've you know whatever schedule they want from a pay standpoint
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		we try to work it with their <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> and that helps because you don't have to just wean wean yourself cold <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">turkey</ENAMEX> and say okay i never get to see my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">eight hours</TIMEX> a day again
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right right
 	
 	
 		and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX> has a lot of programs now for child care referrals i've of course it's too late for me so i've i've not tried them to see how effective they are but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i think we're finally beginning to make progress but just not very fast
 	
 	
 		gosh it's amazing
 	
 	
 		and for our age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> it's too late too little too late
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		but i  i do think it's an area that needs to be looked at and improved because more of us are going to have to work <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two</TIMEX> income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> i think are here to stay
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		well and i would think you know since big business is supposedly
 		why the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> makes the decisions they do
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know the the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that work in big business have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> they have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> so it's only to their advantage that they get these programs going and working and uh
 	
 	
 		right yeah
 		oh sure
 		you retain <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> and keep them longer that's that was the rationale they gave when they were giving us information about our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Employee Assistance Programs</ENAMEX> that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		well they want us to be happy and wa nt us to be able to cope with trying to split ourselves in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fifteen million</NUMEX> pieces
 	
 	
 		right
 		right right
 	
 	
 		so i i hope it helps it seems to help the new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> not have to come back full-time because that's hard
 	
 	
 		oh that's good
 		that's good to know i got a couple of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> that have have found the uh
 		you know a private a private home to take their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> to when they're young until they hit the preschool age and they
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		usually you know you'll find a a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> that's keeping like <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four to six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> and my future future <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister-in-law</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> does that too full-time
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		well in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Plano</ENAMEX> though the problem is you find and this is what i found with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Emily i</ENAMEX> from the time she started <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> grade i wanted her out in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Plano</ENAMEX> area
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i kept finding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> and they'd move she ended up being in a different home <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every year</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh too transit uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i finally decided i didn't like that because it was traumatic to her to get so attached to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> and then have them move so <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> i i tried <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KinderCare</ENAMEX> and then she's old enough to
 	
 	
 		and her surroundings too yeah
