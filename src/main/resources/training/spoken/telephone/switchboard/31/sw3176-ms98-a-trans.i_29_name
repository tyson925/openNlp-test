 
     		
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">okay</ENAMEX> did
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		um all i the scale is from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> i think one being um no
 		or i'm sorry is all total control
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and then <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> as being no control is that what it was
 	
 	
 		oh where would i be i would be somewhere around hm <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">eighth</NUMEX>
 		i think for control
 	
 	
 		okay so that would be like less control
 	
 	
 		oh no um
 	
 	
 		i i'm confused but i don't really think it matters but okay more control  okay and why is that
 	
 	
 		more on the uh higher end
 		yeah
 		oh well for one i think <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">criminals</ENAMEX> um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		they uh i mean i'm all for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> you know hunting and doing their thing although i don't hunt personally
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		um-hum i don't either
 	
 	
 		i don't uh i don't own any <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX> but um you know i mean i've i've shot gun plenty of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX> uh target practice
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		huh
 	
 	
 		and um well i mean i've kind of gone out hunting a little bit you know with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boyfriends</ENAMEX> but uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		gosh i've never done that
 	
 	
 		it's it's fun but you really have to have respect for the weapon
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh but the thing i'm concerned about is you know those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> you know like a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven day</TIMEX> delay is not gonna hurt those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> it's no big thing um you know because it's it's
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know recreation whereas the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who are going out to um you know  for crime
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know to rob somebody now i think that's good that they have enough time to check their record you know and it
 	
 	
 		um-hum where it's a like cool down if they're just like in the bad uh-huh i agree um that's why i'm i guess i'm like <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh yeah it's for everybody's safety
 		uh-huh yeah i mean i could be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> too
 	
 	
 		in the middle because
 		because like if i like i say if someone tried to break into my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> i would wanna get a gun that day
 	
 	
 		oh well i didn't think about that
 	
 	
 		you know for to help be protected <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX> or whatever that night
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but i wouldn't want some crazy nut that you know gets mad at somebody else and says i'm gonna kill them to be able to get a gun that fast so it's like a double-edged <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">sword</ENAMEX> i guess
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 		yeah it definitely is i didn't think about the other side huh
 	
 	
 		so
 		hm hm but i've never i don't know if i've ever shot a gun i don't
 	
 	
 		hm well i served in the service so you have to
 	
 	
 		oh you have to  that's neat
 	
 	
 		you have to uh shoot a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapon</ENAMEX> and qualify otherwise you don't pass
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		huh
 	
 	
 		so to speak and uh so we had to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> it you know to your own eye each <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">gun</ENAMEX> you have to kind of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> to your own eye and how you look at the sights
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and um
 	
 	
 		who but you wanted like slightly more rules like
 		um like you're towards the conservative end
 	
 	
 		oh well i'm kind of fifty fifty you know if you know hearing your argument it got i'm just right smack in the middle
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		um-hum i was just wondering because like since i've never shot one maybe it's different if you've actually shot <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or like you said hunted or you know maybe if i you know had ever shot one
 	
 	
 		oh well you
 		
 
 		well you definitely need to you know have the uh respect for it and you can't just pick up a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">gun</ENAMEX> and expect to hit something you know you may be within let's say a foot foot range
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i mean uh  i don't know half a foot to a foot off
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		um just because of your sights and how you look through a sight  as compared to somebody else
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		hm what kind of hunting have you done
 	
 	
 		oh uh that was uh i i think we just for small but it was quail i think
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		i mean yeah that was just nothing not not anything like <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">deer</ENAMEX> or rabbits or squirrels
 	
 	
 		hm um-hum
 	
 	
 		but uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hm</ENAMEX> because like i have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> that hunt  and um but they're like real careful they kill the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">like one</NUMEX> shot so they don't have like a injured animal running around and um-hum
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		oh well here uh actually about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> away there was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> that fired and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bullet</ENAMEX> actually went through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">deer</ENAMEX> and then hit somebody and killed them
 	
 	
 		hm
 		oh my God
 	
 	
 		so it hit <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different targets um and
 	
 	
 		does that have to be like some heavy duty <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bullet</ENAMEX> to be able to do that or some real super <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">gun</ENAMEX> or
 	
 	
 		i don't know it's i'm surprised because usually when a bullet hits something it um
 		it it compresses you know it loses it's shape
 	
 	
 		hm
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but uh evidently they had bone fragments of both so um yeah it killed and and they've had several instance right here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Raleigh</ENAMEX> and it was national news
 	
 	
 		oh my gosh
 		hm
 	
 	
 		and it was a real big thing but uh had several uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> was out in her backyard and she had a white glove on she was taking her laundry down and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> thought it was the tail of the uh deer
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		oh my God
 	
 	
 		and shot her
 	
 	
 		did she die or
 	
 	
 		uh i think so yeah there was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two or three</NUMEX> killings like right one was a school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> and of course all the school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> uh were upset about it and it made the news so uh
 	
 	
 		hm
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		hm
 	
 	
 		you know it's it hit pretty close to home i guess
 	
 	
 		gosh i'd uh wouldn't wanna live near a forest
 	
 	
 		i know i wouldn't even wanna go hiking you know with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> out there hunting
 	
 	
 		uh-huh really  are you still in the service or
 	
 	
 		no and
