 
     		
 	
 		well basically uh did you wanna go first then
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh well i can i i don't own my home um
 	
 	
 		okay right
 	
 	
 		so i mean i i live in a nice area and i rent my home and uh we aren't sure we're gonna buy a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> yet because we don't know if we're gonna be staying here
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		sure uh-huh
 	
 	
 		in uh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> so
 	
 	
 		yeah i think as far as like our <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">home</ENAMEX> is uh in a small residential area and we're out of the
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> quite a ways so it's kind of more of a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> setting and uh it's just a typical um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedroom</ENAMEX> type of home it's it's nothing you know elaborate where it has uh this or this or you know it's it's just a typical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> with uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedrooms</ENAMEX> uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> story type home and um
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i think as far as if it if we're put it into standards of uh what other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> are around here it would be just about fitting right into the middle part of where the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> are um
 		there's a river across from us which has more elaborate <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> and yet there's
 		where we can view the river from that distance there's still homes within our area that are you know pretty typical of what our <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">home</ENAMEX> is so it's uh pretty much that uh type of um home so
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah well our home our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> we we're renting it from an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> who bought it and he lives in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Korea</ENAMEX> and and uh he's recently moved here and he's owns <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> properties
 	
 	
 		uh
 		uh-huh oh really hm
 		sure
 	
 	
 		uh near here and uh so but the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> around here there's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> on my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> for sale right now
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 		oh yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		which is just uh incredible incredible to me and they're not very expensive either it just seems like we we have a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedroom house</ENAMEX> ours is one level only um but we
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum so it's a rambler style
 	
 	
 		yeah we have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two two</NUMEX> living areas and a dining <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> and a big <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedrooms</ENAMEX> are a little bit small except the master <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedroom</ENAMEX>'s a little bigger so
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah yeah it's kind of like what ours is uh our one of our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedrooms</ENAMEX> is really small and we've made that into a den because we only have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> so that was our best way of going with uh the small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedrooms</ENAMEX> because they are making
 		bedrooms smaller and smaller it seems like they get incredibly small um but uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		anyway but okay that sounds great and uh i don't know if we need to talk anymore or whatever
 	
 	
 		have you done have you done this before
