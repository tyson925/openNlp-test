 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh</ENAMEX> because they told you every last detail
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh i'm trying to think of what else i've seen um
 		oh what was the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> that had amnesia the lawyer
 	
 	
 		uh i don't know
 	
 	
 		um oh it was so good now it's my names escape me um
 	
 	
 		a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">amnesia</ENAMEX> who was in it
 	
 	
 		oh gosh i might try to look through the paper and see
 	
 	
 		okay that's a good idea i didn't have a paper
 	
 	
 		oh let's see what we have
 		it was about a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> who had amnesia uh not doctor lawyer
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and he was a real hustly bustly kind of person
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and then he got amnesia and
 		sort of slowed down and nobody was used to him he had <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">servants</ENAMEX> at home and very very rich and
 	
 	
 		hm i have no idea
 	
 	
 		when he went through his thing his whole personality changed
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		hum
 	
 	
 		and i'm trying to remember the title of it
 	
 	
 		oh is that that Regarding <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry um</ENAMEX>-hum
 	
 	
 		yes it was Regarding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Henry</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i didn't know he was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> in the movie i didn't see it

 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know to get everybody and to  swing deals and do things that were
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		borderline he never did anything illegal but
 	
 	
 		so did he change for the better after that or huh
 	
 	
 		yes yes well he wouldn't defend a case because he knew they were lying
 	
 	
 		that's strange
 	
 	
 		and he was the one that set up the lie for them and
 	
 	
 		is that based on a true story do you know or
