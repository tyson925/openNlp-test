 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay what you mean my voice
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		oh no i am from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kentucky</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh well
 	
 	
 		originally
 		so
 	
 	
 		i heard that the topic <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> was gardening and lawn care
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		ooh
 	
 	
 		i know we're about to hit it here <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a few minutes</TIMEX> i figured i could make this call and get it over with we are going to mow and trim and edge
 		that's all we have been doing all  weekend
 	
 	
 		oh
 		you know what it seems like we are doing it here <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">forever</TIMEX> we bought a a large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX> that was completely unlandscaped i mean it it was probably probably was
 		up to your shoulder in in <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">thistles</ENAMEX> that was all that was there and we hired a professional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">landscaper</ENAMEX> to do it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i have since then probably ripped out
 		half of what he has done because it has always been incorrectly planted or the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> do not make the winter time and
 		so i am kind of at this point  getting a little bit broke and deciding that what we are going to do is we are just going to struggle through the rest of this year
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		probably through the Fall too
 		and uh
 		rip up rip out all the rest of these junipers or anything that requires uh more care than i am willing to give the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> and replace it with hollies
 	
 	
 		uh how many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> do you have
 	
 	
 		just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>

 		but they are just <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eighteen months</TIMEX> apart so it seems like a lot more
 	
 	
 		what year i mean how old are they
 	
 	
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>

 		nuke the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">lawn</ENAMEX> with chemicals
 	
 	
 		if i can just nuke it i'd do it but i do not i just
 		it is like oh i'll get out there and pull my <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">weeds</ENAMEX> i do not have a real big front yard
 		but i do have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of it is a flower bed just about all by the porch because the porch is pretty big i live in town
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but just pulling all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">weeds</ENAMEX> out of that just drives me nuts i do not like it and i just went out <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this weekend</TIMEX> and bought me some <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> and stuff and i just
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		plowed through the whole <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">yards</ENAMEX> got up everything there was some <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> that are just spring <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bloomers</ENAMEX> and i
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		the leaf when the blooms died the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">leaves</ENAMEX> were just horrible looking
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so i just broke all them off it was a hyacinth have you ever seen those
 	
 	
 		oh yes
 	
 	
 		oh they are pretty in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spring</ENAMEX> but the leaves i do not like them you know once
 	
 	
 		but
 		all right now are you sure they are hyacinths because that is a bulb
 	
 	
 		yeah it is a bulb
 	
 	
 		well you should of just ripped the whole thing out
 	
 	
 		no because i do like the i like the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> in the Spring i love those pink <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> they are just pretty so i just cut the leaves off and transplant and put some other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> down because i want them to come back up next year
 	
 	
 		have you had is this <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first year</TIMEX> they have been up
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		well let me tell you they do not come back very well at all maybe they will if up further north but down
 		and you are not that much further north i have probably planted oh around here
 		um maybe <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six hundred</NUMEX> bulbs
 	
 	
 		of hyacinths
 	
 	
 		no i have probably have done hyacinths but i have just learned with from doing hyacinths that if you really like them what you do is you dig the bulbs up and then you throw them away after they are done blooming
 	
 	
 		oh of everything
 	
 	
 		because they do not take the heat here And if they do come back <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</TIMEX> they are going to look real puny
 	
 	
 		oh they will
 	
 	
 		yep
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		about the only bloom bulb that repeats well in my area is the uh uh daffodil and some of the narcissus bulb
 	
 	
 		okay now i have got some daffodils
 		and
 		we everybody down here calls these flags
 		uh the irises i guess
 		um
 	
 	
 		they call them flags
 	
 	
 		that is what they call them down here they get uh
 		just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> bloom
 		on the plant i do not i am not sure what they are called but i do not much
 	
 	
 		when does it leaf when when does it bloom
 	
 	
 		well i think they are stopped blooming now in the spring
 		it has got gay oh they come in all different colors the blooms are on some of them is yellow purple white just all different colors
 	
 	
 		and what color
 		and you only get one of them
 	
 	
 		well i mean per bulb
 		you get <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> big flower that looks like a <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">lily</ENAMEX>
 		i don't know what they are called i have always called them well i don't know what i have called them but when i come down here everybody told me they are flags
 	
 	
 		you know what i bet you they are
 		and i am a pretty i am a pretty good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gardener</ENAMEX> because i have killed a lot of things here and and planted a lot of them and i i work on a uh landscape <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committee</ENAMEX> for our neighborhood
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		our neighborhood is a planned development with

 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but we have <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about sixteen acres</NUMEX> that we have to plant
 		i am going to bet you that is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">lily</ENAMEX> because if it is
 	
 	
 		yeah it is some type of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">lily</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i will get uh

 		with little purple spots that it it will fade into a solid purple
 	
 	
 		and what does the foliage look like does it
 	
 	
 		green spiky <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">leaves</ENAMEX> now it looks almost like a hyacinth only a a lot higher and it is a bulb

 		no they're they've they're died down i am sorry they are dead now they bloom in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spring</ENAMEX>

 		yeah t hey bloomed in the spring
 	
 	
 		well
 		yeah right about after the daffodils
 	
 	
 		right about the same time or after

 		well
 	
 	
 		and to me it just looks like a bunch of leaves but i took them out of my front yard
 		and i just threw them on the side intending to transplant them or throw them away or something
 	
 	
 		yep
 	
 	
 		and forgot about them through the whole <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Winter</TIMEX> well i went out there <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this Spring</TIMEX> and they had took root right where they were on top of each other and they told me that they are the hardest things to you know
 		to kill but they are real easy to grow
 	
 	
 		well
 		ooh
 	
 	
 		does that help
 	
 	
 		well then it is not it is not a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">iris</ENAMEX> then oh gosh
