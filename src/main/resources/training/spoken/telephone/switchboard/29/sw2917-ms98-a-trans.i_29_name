 
     		
 	
 		
 
 		hi what do you do with your credit cards
 	
 	
 		oh  well my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> and i have gotten into some some problems with credit cards we don't handle them very well
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		we we tend to run them up to the maximum and then ask for more
 	
 	
 		oh jeez
 	
 	
 		they they're they're really bad for us um matter of fact we've gotten rid of all of our credit cards except for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MasterCard</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Visa</ENAMEX>
 		then and we pretty much keep those maxed out
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh i was going to say that that sounds like like pretty many but i see what you meant you had them for each of the individual stores
 	
 	
 		yeah we had credit i had probably <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty</TIMEX> credit cards
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um for i had i had an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Express American Express Gold</ENAMEX> an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Optima</ENAMEX> all the different department <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> um
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> Visas <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> MasterCards
 	
 	
 		oh gee
 	
 	
 		i mean i had any time anybody would
 		you know send me an application you know preapproved or whatever i went i took it and it really ended up getting us in some real serious trouble
 	
 	
 		oh sure
 	
 	
 		um
 		because see the more the more credit cards you have the more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> offer them to you
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">um</ENAMEX> and the more you use them the more the more they send them to you
 	
 	
 		but each of these had an annual fee also right
 	
 	
 		exactly and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Express</ENAMEX> was probably the worst the worst
 		um because the with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gold</ENAMEX> card i can't remember how much it was because i didn't even have it very long before i gave it up
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but i know the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Green</ENAMEX> card was like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">five forty five dollars</NUMEX> a year
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">forty five</NUMEX>
 		right i  i
 	
 	
 		um
 		which was a lot because i mean you had to pay it in full <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every month</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		exactly you know i that's it i really resented the fact that they were charging me for cards so i sent back all of mine except the ones that were free
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and um then then i also limited it to one of each
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MasterCard</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Visa</ENAMEX> and here most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> will accept those and actually i then got a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Discover</ENAMEX> card since they pay you back
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah i had a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Discover</ENAMEX> and that was one of the ones in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> that i ended up um closing
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		um
 		it really wasn't my choice though i mean i ended up having i ended up actually losing my credit cards um i ended up going through a credit counseling service
 	
 	
 		oh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um because my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> and i just don't handle credit very well
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah
 	
 	
 		and um when when you do that they automatically once you start with their service they close your accounts out
 	
 	
 		oh i see
 	
 	
 		so i'm still paying on all these accounts but  my accounts are closed
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so and i would prefer to keep it that way once we once we're paid off
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um
 		i would prefer just to have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MasterCard</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Visa</ENAMEX> and that's it
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah actually i pay off my cards <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every month</TIMEX> only once in my life have i not paid
 	
 	
 		i think that's a really good way to handle it because that way if you if you paid off <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every month</TIMEX> you never have to worry about well
 		how much do i have to pay these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> you know <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this month</TIMEX> you know this you buy what you can afford i mean if you handle it just like you would like a check or cash
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		right and
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um it's a lot easier to keep it in check
 	
 	
 		well and also in a sense they're giving you a loan for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a month</TIMEX> so that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know if i were smarter i would have that same amount in savings and get the interest which i don't do but
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but yeah the
 		the thought of adding you know <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">X percent</NUMEX> to to the price of what i buy i just i can't accept
 	
 	
 		yeah and i and i think at this at this point in time with the economy the way it is
 		um
 		i think that um it's going to get even worse
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um
 		i'm i'm glad that we're starting to pay our debts off off now
 		um
 		you know we started we started i mean we started <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this last year</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and we probably still have <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about another year</TIMEX> to go before we're completely out of the hole
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but i think this they way the whole economy's is going right now it's just not good to be in debt
 	
 	
 		that's right that's right
 		yeah yeah that i would that would be a very scary feeling for me to know that i was you know juggling payments to different people
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i guess because i never experienced it and it's not because you know i'm rich or anything it's just uh a mental concept that i have
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah that i just
 	
 	
 		well when when it's you when you're getting rid of the whole credit card cycle and if you really get into the mind set
 		i got really good at juggling money and basically robbing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter</ENAMEX> to pay <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul</ENAMEX> and i and i it was scary because i was so good at it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i thought this this is not right i mean this has got to stop because eventually it'd end up catching up at and catching up with me and it hit me in the face
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		but it sounds like you know you you learned from it and you're coming out of it all right
 	
 	
 		i yeah i have i've learned a lot from it um i've learned that credit cards are extremely dangerous in my hand
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>'s too because he's he's the same way i am
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i don't i don't think that
 		well when we when we buy on credit we just don't have a concept of how much money we're spending
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		until the bill comes in
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and all then all of a sudden you look at the bill and you go oh my gosh i spent this much
 	
 	
 		um-hum but now the fact that you still have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> cards are you do you use them more judiciously
 	
 	
 		yeah we pretty much use them for for emergency type things like um
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transmission</ENAMEX> fell out on our car
 	
 	
 		uh yeah
 	
 	
 		and that paid for a new transmission
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">um</ENAMEX> and and things like that um
 		and we try we try not to use them for you know
 	
 	
 		purchases
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inc</ENAMEX> idental type things like you know gas and stuff like that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		clothing sales sales i find are a pain
 	
 	

 		yeah
 		yeah
 		i've i've gotten i've gotten a lot more away from from credit cards and i i pay by check a lot more now
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		well it sounds good you know like i said it sounds like you're you've really got it under control
 	
 	
 		i i admire you for for having that um
 		uh mind set for not not even getting you know past that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty days</TIMEX> i i would that's ideally the where where i would like to be
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah and like i said once once it it happened i couldn't because my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX>'s tuition came due and i guess i had you know not really counted on it quite
 		at that point but um yeah i didn't like it at all i was very uncomfortable  so you know and and i mean it was
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		i can imagine
 	
 	
 		i thought a lot <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixty</TIMEX> dollars interest or something for for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">just a couple of months</TIMEX> and i'm going jeez that's outrageous  but in in you know retrospect it wasn't all that much i mean a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> pay a lot more and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and you know but still i mean i figured i didn't need those items if it cost me <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixty</TIMEX> dollars more to have them
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		you think about what you can buy for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixty</TIMEX> dollars
 	
 	
 		exactly  groceries for a week  yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		i i think about all all the money that that we've spent on interest
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		on all of our credit cards and it's just incredible
 	
 	
 		but now did you use to not feel so badly because you could take it off your income tax
 	
 	
 		we've never been able to take it off our income tax i'm i'm fairly newly married i've only been married um <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">less than two years</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and before that
 		i never owned a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> or anything so i never had any deductions
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		so really it was always just money
 	
 	
 		thrown away yeah jeez
 	
 	
 		thrown away
 		and i never really thought about it because
 	
 	
 		you were good at it
 	
 	
 		yeah i was so good at it that it just kind of got stuck in the back of my mind and just never
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">um</ENAMEX> became a real problem until all of a sudden it came an insurmountable problem
 	
 	
 		yeah i suspect that you know thinking about it and looking at my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> and the number of credit cards that they use and you know the amount that i know they buy i guess probably a lot of them are
 		in a similar situation and you know just don't talk about it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		most most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> don't like to talk about money they feel uncomfortable i think
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know because i mean i guess for a lot of people it is very personal
 	
 	
 		very personal
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah and especially if you if you don't feel you're handling it quite right or that somebody might make fun of you or that it would be
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		but i i think the the average <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> is probably
 		pretty heavily in debt
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		not not including like a mortgage i mean a mortgage is an understandable debt
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um because that's you have you have to have a roof over your head
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and i would much rather own my own <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> than than
 		be renting it like we're doing i mean we're basically you know kind of throwing <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">seven hundred dollars</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a month</TIMEX> away
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		we're renting a house
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but
 		but you know right now with the way our credit card situation is there's nobody in the world that's going to
 		give us a mortgage on a house
 	
 	
 		right right
 		but but once i suppose you you prove yourself by paying this off <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</TIMEX> you'll be in very good shape
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah it's it's going to it's going to take quite a while um hopefully within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five years</TIMEX> we'll be in our own home
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but um i'm not really counting on it real soon
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum so that's that's been an even harder lesson then if it affected
 	
 	
 		yeah
