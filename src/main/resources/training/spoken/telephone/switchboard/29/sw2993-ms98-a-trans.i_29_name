 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		are you in the market for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> recently
 	
 	
 		yeah i just bought a car
 	
 	
 		oh what'd you get
 	
 	
 		i got a nineteen <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eighty three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cavalier</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">station wagon</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh-huh what what convinced you to get that one
 	
 	
 		well a a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>'s and he'd driven it all over the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> and it runs great
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		oh incredible how many miles on it
 	
 	
 		it's like it has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred and fifty three thousand</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		and it's still running real well
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		oh great yeah we have um right now we have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> um i have my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> and myself we have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sons</ENAMEX> who are drivers
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of which is a um an <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eighty eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Plymouth Voyager Van</ENAMEX> and then we have um <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about a year ago</TIMEX> we picked up a second hand uh uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Audi</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> and uh that was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> you know a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">sedan</ENAMEX> and uh we got that i don't i'll
 		the major things the reason why we got that is we had had a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nova</ENAMEX> and a well my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> was driving and someone came into his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lane</ENAMEX> and hit
 		him and fortunately he was able to his i mean he was checked out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> was out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">that night</TIMEX> but the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> was completely totaled
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike</ENAMEX> and they had been my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sons</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sons</ENAMEX> had been a passenger in a car <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about a year and a half</TIMEX> before that which was hit by another car
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		so i mean i got i was getting really nervous so i finally said we i want a really solid car
 		so we found the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Audi</ENAMEX> second hand i guess right now my criteria for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> is uh uh solid being solid able to take an impact
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and uh so uh i we're not going to be in the market for in the near future for any new car
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but the the things that i would want would be a solid car another thing i'd definitely want would be antilock brakes
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh our our <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">van</ENAMEX> which is a a delight to drive does not have i i think the brakes on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Plymouth</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">van</ENAMEX> is just are terrible
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		um if the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> is at all wet and i'm and i don't go all that fast but the uh it it just doesn't hold it doesn't hold well at all
 		so uh i i definitely would want to get antilock brakes so i don't know uh do you have any particular things that
 		that are priorities on your list
 	
 	
 		well it's i didn't really need power windows but it has power you know windows and steering and air conditioning and and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i guess down there air conditioning's a must isn't it
 	
 	
 		um-hum oh yeah it it has a stereo and a cassette <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">player</ENAMEX> and um it he's told me it gets forty <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">two miles</NUMEX> to gallon
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		that's incredible that is incredible
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		so
 	
 	
 		uh we we get about our the uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">van</ENAMEX> gets on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">highways</ENAMEX> can get <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about twenty eight</NUMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Audi</ENAMEX> does not have good mileage that's the one drawback it's a powerful car
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um
 		but it does not uh i mean i if i'm on a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">highway</ENAMEX> and i can get <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty twenty</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> miles in per gallon
 		i consider that lucky i'm lucky maybe maybe sometimes i've gotten <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twenty two</NUMEX> it comes out around the eighteen or nineteen local driving and that's a to me is a real drawback i wish i would you know i could settle for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty eight</TIMEX> or
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but uh the um the frills on that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> are nice but they're not necessary for me except air conditioning in this area uh in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DC</ENAMEX> area it gets hot and humid
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		really um-hum it's really humid
 	
 	
 		yeah uh so air conditioning is definitely uh definitely a necessity for us through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two or three months in the summer</TIMEX> um but i um
 		i i don't need uh you know power windows are nice but i don't need them
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		although i must say when you're driving in the east and there are all these toll <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX> come into a toll <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> push that button down it's real nice for that window to zip down and zip up instead of having to crank it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		crank yeah um-hum
 	
 	
 		yeah but or you know if you want to have open windows to be able to open if you're alone in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> just to press buttons and but you know i've lived all these <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> without them i probably could have lived a little longer
 	
 	
 		right
 		
 
 		you don't have to stretch
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		uh one of the things that we have uh we've liked when we've gotten a new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> and this this used <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> has it is a sun roof
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and those are really nice in in good weather
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		so uh so i guess if we get a new car it definitely would have to have antilock antilock brakes i'd love to get uh an air bag
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and a sun roof
 		and uh just so it'd be a good solid car i guess that's those are my my major criteria everything else is you know a luxury and they make the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> more expensive but they often add more things to repair when things go wrong
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right
 	
 	
 		so uh but if you were to buy a new car now a brand new car what would you look for
 	
 	
 		um yeah like you said antilock brakes and air bag and uh i'd i'd really like to have a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> that's dependable
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		that that you drive you know like a
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX> made <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> that's as dependable as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mercedes</ENAMEX> or something you know that's
 	
 	
 		isn't that true it's it's funny um
 		uh that you use uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Audi</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> and i have to say it has been pretty dependable
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah sometimes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> advantage of an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> made <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> is if you get stuck anywhere most local <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garages</ENAMEX> can fix you up
 	
 	
 		yeah they have parts uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but once you get if you start once you get something fancy you get stuck somewhere off of the main area you can be really and the parts i know the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Audi</ENAMEX> parts are terribly expensive
 	
 	
 		right
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i i mean it just i shudder i would not get the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Audi</ENAMEX> again just for that reason
 		but i would love i wish an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> that you know engineering would make something as solid as a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> car
 		you know we certainly have the technology but it's amazing when we bought this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Audi</ENAMEX> i mean everything is more solid in it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh it you don't feel you've got any of the flabby plastic
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i know and i i and i'm willing to give up a little bit in the mileage for a for a solid car i don't think i have to give up as much as i'm giving up
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but uh do you need air conditioning down there
 	
 	
 		yes we really do because even <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> it's it's supposed to get up into the nineties so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh we've had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eleven</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days in a row</TIMEX> over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ninety</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		they've in fact had to excuse school down here because of that
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		well listen i enjoyed talking with you
 	
 	
 		it was nice talking to you
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">okay</ENAMEX> and enjoy enjoy your car
