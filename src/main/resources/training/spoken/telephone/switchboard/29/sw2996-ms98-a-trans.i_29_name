 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well i always think i'm paying too much taxes how about you
 	
 	
 		yeah oh definitely  seems like
 	
 	
 		
 
 		although at least <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> doesn't have a state income tax yet i mean you know they keep threatening us that maybe there'll be a day that they're going to uh enact this i think uh
 		the um other means of providing income for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> have been dwindling so they keep trying to say we may need a uh state income tax
 	
 	
 		yeah i think that uh we probably will have to have to uh have a state income tax because uh <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Texans</ENAMEX> don't approve of such things as lotteries
 		uh uh well i i come i come here from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> had a state lottery and it really raised a lot of money for the for the state
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh although we in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> we had to pay a state and a city uh tax and it was really a great relief when i got to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> that i didn't have to pay that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> income tax though
 	
 	
 		yeah makes quite a bit of difference in your uh well your income level you know because other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> take chunk quite a bit a chunk out for uh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> and state taxes so you're uh looking at your <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yearly</TIMEX> salary it makes quite a difference
 	
 	
 		right
 		it sure does make make a difference
 	
 	
 		a little more take home here
 	
 	
 		uh-huh do you live in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Richardson</ENAMEX> area
 	
 	
 		oh you do oh
 	
 	
 		yeah i work at uh well mainly the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Expressway Site</ENAMEX> is where i work
 	
 	
 		oh i do too
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		okay
 		and then you know too that uh taxes are are less like if you live in Mesquite
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> will go shopping in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mesquite</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">malls</ENAMEX> out there uh
 	
 	
 		or up to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Collin County</ENAMEX> somewhere that you're getting out of the um <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas County</ENAMEX> area because what do we pay like <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> and a half percent something like that for the uh sales tax
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> point <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		which yeah that really is pretty high
 	
 	
 		is it the same is it uh less in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Collin County</ENAMEX> than it is in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas County</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i think so although i really i don't go up there too much i mean i i normally just kind of go to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Richardson Square Mall</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Valley View Mall</ENAMEX> just kind of for the convenience uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i guess maybe if i was going to buy a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> or something maybe i would consider where i was buying it to try to you know save a little bit on that sales tax because on a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> that really matters kind of mounts up
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah it sure did and then once you could deduct at least some of that um off off your income tax and you can't do that anymore
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it really hit me <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> i had uh air conditioning service for my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> done and i had a little little uh coupon special that was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty two</TIMEX> dollars for um air conditioning service where they
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh checked it and charged recharged it and put <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one one</NUMEX> pound of freon in and if you needed another pound of freon they gave it it was like <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">seven dollars</NUMEX> and something
 		and then with the with the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty two</TIMEX> dollars and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> something it all came out to i i ended up paying like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty four</TIMEX> dollars and i couldn't believe it and it the tax you know really hits you
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah that's true although i wish i wish you know overall they'd try the lottery again when did you first come to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um-hum and then
 		oh it's been i've been here for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nine years</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		okay well that's about the same time as me i came down in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eighty two</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		really where'd you come from
 	
 	
 		um well <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX> kind of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> live in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX> i had lived a little while in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Michigan</ENAMEX> but you know basically i went to high school and college in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX> and lived there uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more years</TIMEX> than i ever did in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Michigan</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		well uh i did visit uh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Michigan</ENAMEX> i visited <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kalamazoo</ENAMEX> once my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> used to live there
 	
 	
 		oh okay but you know when we first came down here i really thought this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">place</ENAMEX> was somewhat backward i mean i was just shocked that we couldn't shop on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		that's true i tell you what hit me <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first year</TIMEX> i was here uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">eve</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> there used to be <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> open the department <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> wouldn't close uh
 	
 	
 		remember that
 	
 	
 		well i'd say they closed maybe <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eight or nine</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">o'clock</TIMEX> the department <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">eve</TIMEX> but uh there were <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> that you could go to uh you know like discount <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> down in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX> and just all over the place where you could go to and you could shop till like twelve or <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one o'clock that night</TIMEX> and that was like that was really the only night they were open that late but it was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">eve</TIMEX> and when i came to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i thought i was going to do that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">eve</TIMEX> and i couldn't find hardly anything open  after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five o'clock in the afternoon</TIMEX> and i was oh i was i really i really was stuck
 	
 	
 		
 
 		were you shocked like oh no i'm stuck i need to buy stuff
 	
 	
 		and i think <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Target</ENAMEX> was the one that stayed open later than anybody anybody else and uh i was able to pick up a few things in there but boy i was i was really shocked
 		and then another shock i had  well when i went to uh to buy a slice of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pizza</ENAMEX> and found out that i had to buy the whole pie
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh few places now seem to do it by the slice but
 	
 	
 		yeah now but they but back then they didn't when i <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> came no
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		anyway
 	
 	
 		well the the uh there was other things too i mean i think it's taken us <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yankee</ENAMEX>'s influence down here to get them to uh come to the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the the</TIMEX> you know the correct <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decade</TIMEX> here and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">century</TIMEX> um
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i couldn't believe that you could have open containers of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beer</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> whatever in the car
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		i mean you could always um uh be careful about that back then because uh you know if you if a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cop</ENAMEX> stopped you then you would um you know get arrested or whatnot and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> would just drink openly
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		it yeah and talk a talking about <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> and beer look at the taxes on that and the taxes on a package of of cigarettes i used to smoke you know and uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		that would have been enough to to make me me give them up the price of them now but i gave them up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">couple</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple years ago</TIMEX> because i had some sinus problems
 	
 	
 		oh well i don't smoke so i don't really know what the taxes are and stuff on it
 	
 	
 		well
 		well they're like two
 		or i i believe they're hitting <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">two dollars</NUMEX> a pack now
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		maybe a little bit a little bit a little bit more in some places
 	
 	
 		so you end up about paying about twelve dollars for a pack and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">two dollars</NUMEX> of that is taxes
 	
 	
 		uh well i believe it's a little more than twelve dollars for a carton i think it's maybe thirteen or something
 	
 	
 		huh
 		gee
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> because i remember we went to to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oklahoma</ENAMEX> to this this bingo place this <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Choctaw</ENAMEX> bingo uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple weeks ago</TIMEX> and somebody that went with me bought a carton
 		for uh uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> dollars and something and they really thought they were getting a big discount
 	
 	
 		they're cheaper there
 	
 	
 		well because it's you know the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indians</ENAMEX> i don't think they pay tax
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		in in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oklahoma</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh i got you okay
 	
 	
 		and uh it was a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX>
 		it well it's a bingo <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX> for the benefit of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indians</ENAMEX> there although i didn't see very many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in there  there were just bus loads of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that come from everywhere else to play that bingo because it's it's
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		the stakes are higher and payoffs are bigger and so forth  i won a dollar  yeah i had fun uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple people</ENAMEX> on the bus won some money <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> won <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		well how'd you do
 		a dollar oh well but you had fun playing right
