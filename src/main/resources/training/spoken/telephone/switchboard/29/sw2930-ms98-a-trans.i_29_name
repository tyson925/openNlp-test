 		well not necessarily in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> but it's a very short drive to areas near here
 	
 	
 		uh-huh do you do a lot of camping
 	
 	
 		well i have done camping in the past uh
 		i can't remember when the last time i actually went camping was it was uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several years ago</TIMEX> and then i did most of my camping in the mountains
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well that must have been fun though
 	
 	
 		well it is i enjoy hiking and camping we went <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sangre de Cristos</ENAMEX> to the i have uh some land there and so it's it's handy to to station yourself there on the land and then
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		make trips up into the mountains for backpacking and hiking and and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">overnight</TIMEX> camping
 	
 	
 		well that sounds fun
 	
 	
 		do you do most of yours in tents
 	
 	
 		yeah we've done ours i've only been camping twice
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of them i don't really consider camping it was on the edge of the lake
 	
 	
 		
  
 		um
 	
 	
 		and it was at a camp i don't like those camping grounds where you know you got R V beside you and then another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tents</ENAMEX> beside you
 	
 	
 		uh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i just don't care for that
 	
 	
 		no i agree with you i think it's much nicer when you can really get out far enough away where that you can't see <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>  right out the window but
 	
 	
 		right well
 		it doesn't uh we uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four years ago</TIMEX> it was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about four years ago</TIMEX> my little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three months old</TIMEX> and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time i left him we went overnight camping and we went and we found this little peninsula out in the middle of nowhere by the lake
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and we had a ball just sat out there with our we didn't even use <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tents</ENAMEX> then we just had uh sleeping bags and fire going and we fried <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">potatoes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacon</ENAMEX> and everything for breakfast <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the next morning</TIMEX> oh it did it did
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		doesn't that always taste so much better when you're out like that yeah
 	
 	
 		oh it did it did i didn't even think about frying <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">potatoes</ENAMEX> but my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister-in-law</ENAMEX> she's always done a lot of camping
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and she's good she'd think about bringing a rake so you can rake your area out and you know
 	
 	
 		that's right if you don't you'll find every rock on it when you
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		put your when you put your bag down
 	
 	
 		well she yeah she was she is always prepared i mean she brought everything from like i said toilet paper to the rake the only thing we'd had to do
 		we had to go out looking for some kind of a grill you know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		we and we and we seen this old refrigerator that somebody had dumped
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and we broke the i guess it's the freezing component and we broke that out of there and put it over our um hole
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh what a clever idea i wouldn't have thought about that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well it held our pan and you know the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">potatoes</ENAMEX> and stuff we had a good time
 	
 	
 		oh that's a good idea
 	
 	
 		yeah we're still waiting to go again
 	
 	
 		um-hum well if you get a chance now there are some really nice camping areas uh up in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wichitas</ENAMEX> which is in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oklahoma</ENAMEX> and uh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arkansas</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i can't remember the name it's it's on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oklahoma Arkansas</ENAMEX> border
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and it won't take but just a you know just a quick look at a map to find
 		where those mountains are but i took a drive up through there as a matter of fact last <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September</TIMEX> just took the drive through to see what was there they have some wonderful camping areas there beautiful beautiful country
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		pretty
 		well i love to swim so i like to get out by a lake or a uh you know somewhere close where we can swim
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 		right well <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lake Lake Tawakoni</ENAMEX> is a pretty nice place
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and we had a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedroom</ENAMEX> mobile home there but the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> still liked to throw their sleeping bags out by the lake and build a little fire and roast their marshmallows until the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes</ENAMEX> bit and then they came in
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 		how old are your boys
 	
 	
 		oh oh they're grown now
 	
 	
 		oh so they don't go camping with you
 	
 	
 		they go camping on their own once you start them they enjoy it all their lives
 	
 	
 		oh
 		yeah well i haven't taken my little  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> yet i'm afraid to get him out he is
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so fearless he it terrifies me  he
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh don't be concerned there's much less for them to get hurt on camping than there is elsewhere
 	
 	
 		think so well it's the water he's not scared of he'll go out into it until it's up to his nose
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and then try to tread back
 	
 	
 		
  
 		uh-huh well it's easy to keep him occupied though on land i know that i took my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> we'd go out and i've them walk with me along the lakefront and we'd have a little contest finding the tiniest shell and finding the biggest shell and
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		or we'd hunt pine <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cones</ENAMEX> or we climbed some uh pinon pines <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one year</TIMEX> and gathered the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cones</ENAMEX> so that we could eat the pine nuts
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and we did a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">naturalist</ENAMEX> work when we were out we you know we we searched for <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dock</ENAMEX> and we ate the wild <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> and we gathered wild <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">berries</ENAMEX> and uh  it's really
 		you know the the mountains can accommodate you if you know what to find
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		if you know what to look for
 	
 	
 		uh-huh i had my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> build their own little camp you know <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> leg camp stools by cutting a branch off the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> and binding them together with bark
 	
 	
 		well that sounds so neat
 	
 	
 		and uh we cooked in a pot i baked them a cake right there on a camp fire they were so impressed i used a tire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> and the bottom of a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> oven
 	
 	
 		yes
 		well i'm impressed  my
