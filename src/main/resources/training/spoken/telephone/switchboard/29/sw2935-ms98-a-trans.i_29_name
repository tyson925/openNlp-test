 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well what kind of garden do you have
 	
 	
 		well we've tried having let me turn the TV off we've tried having uh
 		vegetable garden and i'm from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX> and the way that uh bug bugs and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">weeds</ENAMEX> grow down here is very different from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and we have tried several years in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a row</TIMEX> and we've given up between the fire <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ants</ENAMEX> the pill bugs the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">weeds</ENAMEX> the drought and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred and ten</NUMEX> degree heat all Summer and we just kind of uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		decided to go with a few <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> and give up on the vegetable garden
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		we had to put so much poison out on everything that we thought who'd want to eat that stuff
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know so we have really been frustrated by our gardening attempts here and uh if you really water a lot you can do it but you know when you have to pay for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> it really gets to be an annoyance to have to water constantly
 	
 	
 		um-hum do you have a lawn
 	
 	
 		so right now we're just yeah we we just try to maintain the lawn and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">shrubs</ENAMEX> right now and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>  we have a peach <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> that's the extent of our um contributing to our food supply
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but that's nice to have but yeah yeah so what do you do up there
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		well um actually  it we've sort of had an ideal Spring
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		and um the the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">peonies</ENAMEX> have been out for now <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about three weeks</TIMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">roses</ENAMEX> have been blooming for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks</TIMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">grass</ENAMEX> is uh this lush green and of course i've got lots of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">weeds</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mine</ENAMEX> because i don't use any poison either
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but um you know i just keep looking at and i say jeez you know this is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first year</TIMEX> it's been so perfect
 	
 	
 		really gosh
 	
 	
 		but and my garden you know  my <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tomatoes</ENAMEX> are <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">two and a half feet</NUMEX> tall
 	
 	
 		oh boy
 	
 	
 		the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		that sounds wonderful
 	
 	
 		you know i'm going i'm going gee this can't you know we'll have a freeze
 	
 	
 		if you don't have a frost you'll be all right
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that's what i remember from living up north is that you'd get everything set and then you'd have a frost and half the stuff would get frostbitten and you'd have to
 	
 	
 		well that's it <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> i think it was you know my <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">peonies</ENAMEX> were were budding in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January</TIMEX> and you know there was no way that was going to make it and sure enough you know we did had really mild weather until
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">wow uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i think it was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX> or something and then you know everything just got hit hard
 	
 	
 		oh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> that's frustrating
 	
 	
 		
 
 		so but yeah it it's interesting and i enjoy gardening my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> does the mowing of the grass
 	
 	
 		oh yeah my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> does that thank goodness because i that's not a pleasure for me
 	
 	
 		i don't think that's a pleasure for anybody the mowing the mowing
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		i love gardens that are well tended and i just there's been a few different places i've lived where i've just
 		i don't know whether it's little old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ladies</ENAMEX> living there or what but you could just tell that they had a love uh a love affair with their gardens with beautiful wild <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> and just i love the host of colors that just keep coming all you know year long
 		and uh i i was in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX> once and that's one thing that impressed me so much is no matter what size yard somebody had they had a beautiful garden in it you know it could be <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">three feet by four feet</NUMEX> or something
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so i do admire that but i haven't really put uh too much energy into it course we have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three years old</TIMEX> so
 	
 	
 		oh they help you
 	
 	
 		so that has put a crimp in my every activity other than diapers and laundry i'll tell you
 	
 	
 		oh dear
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		oh but that's nice you know i mean the peach <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> is is a start and
 	
 	
 		that yeah that's really lovely i would love to have different fruit trees
 		it's it's been wonderful to have the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peaches</ENAMEX> they're just delicious and we we have we have still have to spray some but we don't have to just asphyxiate asphyxiate ourself with the poison which is good because i just i can't see the point in doing that and eating anything out of it afterwards
 	
 	
 		right what about <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tomatoes</ENAMEX> aren't they pretty hardy
 	
 	
 		um we've tried them but again it's just like the sun scorch we've tried them in kind of halfway in the shade and halfway in the sun i mean it's just
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		see you really really have to be prepared to water constantly during the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Summer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that have been successful out here have done this drip irrigation
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and installed that and um that's really what makes the most sense because you don't have to use so much <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it really does the job but it's just amazing how hot and dry and for how long it gets out here
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and if you're not really committed to it i mean me i'm you know i'm real committed to it for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about a week</TIMEX> and then i forget about it for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a week</TIMEX> and then i go oh yeah i need to do something and by then it's burned up you know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it's just too distracting right now with these little ones in our lives so maybe when i get older i'll find uh some joy in that
 	
 	
 		well i would assume assume too i mean you've got <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three or four months</TIMEX> you're talking about of
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		of bad weather
 	
 	
 		yeah it just gets so hot so fast here we don't have really a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Spring or a Fall</ENAMEX> and it just um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		immediately heats up so that's one thing i miss about living up north as i remember
 		um you know the long <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Springs</ENAMEX> and long <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Falls</ENAMEX> and the cooler weather you know it was really nice
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		we always had gardens when i was uh living in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX> in fact my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> once tore up our entire back yard
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		and redid it i'll never forget got my stepfather to put in uh a waterfall and a little pond in one corner i mean that was like the most energy invested in anything in the whole time i ever knew him
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		they remodeled the entire back yard then they sold the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and got divorced so i don't know what that says about it all
 	
 	
 		oh dear
 		
 
 	
 	
 		oh but she used to love to do stuff like that
 	
 	
 		sounds like it would have been pretty
 	
 	
 		yeah it really was i enjoyed it there
 		but maybe when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> get a little older we'll do some more planting because they like to see things grow they've done a couple of little <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seed</ENAMEX> projects and
 		so i think it will be fun for them
 	
 	
 		oh sure
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		sure
 		well it sounds like you you've got your hands full
 	
 	
 		oh yes  they're both running around now
 	
 	
 		
 
 		and you know gardening isn't isn't high on the list but it's not off the list
 	
 	
 		yeah well it's very therapeutic i think really to get out there and dig in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dirt</ENAMEX> you know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		they certainly enjoy that part of it
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it's just trying to keep anything i planted bulbs last uh Fall on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">side guard</ENAMEX> and when i went out there in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spring</ENAMEX>
 		and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first day</TIMEX> they came out the little one went and pulled all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> off and the flower petals were scattered all over the walk
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		he thought what are these fun toys that mommy put out here with all these colors for me to play with
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		we use to didn't eat them i mean i guess i could be thankful for that
 	
 	
 		right maybe <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</TIMEX> they'll do better
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah really if they survive this year
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh dear
 	
 	
 		oh well good luck to you nice talking to you
 	
 	
 		okay well thanks it was nice talking to you too bye-bye
 	
 	
 		okay bye-bye
