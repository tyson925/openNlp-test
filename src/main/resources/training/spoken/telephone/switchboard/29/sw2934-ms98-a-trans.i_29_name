 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay how's the weather been out there
 	
 	
 		well <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last three days</TIMEX> it's been pretty rainy we went to the beach and uh it started uh let's see around <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">four o'clock</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh it had thunder and lightning it was and then you know it was just overcast and rainy for uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next two two or three days</TIMEX> straight how about yours
 	
 	
 		it's been pretty normal for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> you know uh they have tornadoes about once a week and it rains <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about every three days the last two years</TIMEX> before they've had record <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rainfall</ENAMEX>
 		by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this time of the year</TIMEX> they'd had enough <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rainfall</ENAMEX> for the whole <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> but this time we're only um i think maybe <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">five inches</NUMEX> ahead of of uh normal so it's not been bad at all
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		you're from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i'm from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		i heard they had some flooding down there
 	
 	
 		um they had some flooding in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Houston</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the other day</TIMEX> real real bad over i think it was over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the weekend</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		hum
 	
 	
 		the radar just looked nasty with a bunch of red splotches all across it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		well <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last couple of years</TIMEX> we're um we're over as far as our <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rainfall</ENAMEX> goes before that it was really dry and uh everybody was you know talking about rationing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> and doing this and doing that
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		not really rationing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> but just cutting down and uh it seems like uh you know the weather pattern is just shifting and uh that uh jet stream is moving uh into our area <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Carolina</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah that's that's right
 	
 	
 		and across but it's uh changing latitude
 	
 	
 		there you
 		um-hum so you get a lot more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rain</ENAMEX> that way
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		brings in that cold air and mixes it with the with the warm air coming off the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic Ocean</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		that's what
 	
 	
 		it's finally cleared up it's just now still still a little overcast but the sun but the sun has finally started popping out
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		is the temperature like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixty sixty</TIMEX> to eighties there too or
 	
 	
 		oh yeah well <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">right now</TIMEX> as a matter of fact i'm fixing to go play <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">tennis</ENAMEX> it's um i'd say it's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least seventy nine</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">eighty well</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about seventy eight seventy nine degrees</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		um do you get east winds a lot of the time from the ocean or
 	
 	
 		um actually the uh the wind normally blows let's see let me think about this south southwest
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah uh but actually but actually our i guess our weather pattern comes from the uh
 		blows north east yeah you're right it blows north east
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		that's the way it does here most of the time
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but uh sometimes it just comes straight from the north and then it and then it doesn't veer off to the east until you get down to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Houston</ENAMEX> or or uh maybe <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid mid</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> depends on how strong the cold fronts are
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		how far how far are you from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Houston</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um well uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richardson</ENAMEX>'s a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">suburb</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh i see so you so you don't have you don't get anything off the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gulf</ENAMEX> uh immediately from from the ocean
 	
 	
 		hardly ever unless there's a hurricane or something like that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		well uh it's kind of early for for i was going to say the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">weather man</ENAMEX> on on uh one of our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stations</ENAMEX> was
 		talking about the way that the weather's doing now is like tropical weather and he was afraid if it kept doing that that they'd have early hurricanes early hurricanes this year
 	
 	
 		hm well we've had some you know pretty pretty rough winds oh uh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bangladesh Bangladesh</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> they they caught it bad
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		kind of wiped them out
 	
 	
 		but we'll probably have our share of the hurricanes i know uh <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Hurricane Hugo</ENAMEX> you probably heard about that uh last year
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		wiped everything out
 	
 	
 		yeah and they're still uh  rebuilding from that storm
 		so the the beaches here just get really beat up uh
 		and it usually comes this way
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it comes up from uh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Miami</ENAMEX> uh down around or you know around the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bahamas</ENAMEX> and it usually travels uh northwest
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh it'll go up the coast quite a ways before it finally hits
 	
 	
 		do you do you get many tornadoes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this time of year</TIMEX> or
 	
 	
 		um let's see <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years ago</TIMEX> we had one as a matter of fact it went within <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a mile</NUMEX> of my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and uh it was real odd the um barometric pressure drops during a tornado and our uh fire alarm went off
 	
 	
 		um
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		huh
 	
 	
 		so of course that woke everybody up and we knew what was going on to uh you know go downstairs or go into the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedroom bathroom</ENAMEX> and uh take cover but uh
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		we get uh yeah we're we're uh we get our share of tornadoes
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		and uh the uh
 		uh you you aren't in the mountains or anything like that are you there's just hills there's just hills
 	
 	
 		no huh-uh we're about <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two hours</TIMEX> from the beach so uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know it's uh barometric pressure i believe is higher in the mountains and we catch we catch some winds you know a few winds coming off of them i think but uh let's see y'all just had a tornado
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh over close to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oklahoma</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah they they had a lot of them they had a a huge one that was on um Inside Edition <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the other night</TIMEX> in uh the southern part of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kansas</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um they took a bunch of film of it it it uh
 		kind of chased them it was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a few hundred yards</NUMEX> away and it chased them under an underpass and it was tossing around the car right before it got there and it tore up the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> inside the car
 	
 	
 		oh gosh
 		oh did it
 	
 	
 		and the the camera <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> on the news <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crew</ENAMEX> held the camera out they were hiding underneath the underpass and he held the camera out as the tornado went by
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		and you the the wind you know it had a mike on it and the wind and everything was incredible
 	
 	
 		um boy i would have like to have heard that that could would have been something
 	
 	
 		i i'm surprised they didn't they because we saw it on the news <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of days in a row</TIMEX> and that and you know and that was way up in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kansas</ENAMEX> but over here it's a lot it's a big thing about tornados and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that get pictures of them
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		uh-huh i used to live in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amarillo</ENAMEX> originally so i'm
 	
 	
 		yeah you can really see them well there yeah
 	
 	
 		oh yeah  we used to sit out uh especially in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Borger</ENAMEX> we use to sit out on our back uh picnic table
 	
 	
 		um-hum uh
 	
 	
 		and watch them come out of the sky through the funnel clouds and the only time we got worried is if it hit the ground but otherwise we'd just sit back there and watch them go in and out of those clouds
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		it's really strange the way it does that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		especially the wa y it starts it starts you know just like a little swirl in the clouds and
 		and uh then it just grows from there
 	
 	
 		yep
 	
 	
 		and it and and usually it's not even raining when it starts it's just
 	
 	
 		yeah you'd be amazed at how clear the sky was but the clouds are just really uh uh rolling kind of just real pillowy i guess
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		that's right and they're black and sometimes they're even green colored
 	
 	
 		oh well i was in that uh big tornado went through <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wichita Falls</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh the sky i mean we were right in the middle of it when i mean signs and telephone poles were dropping all around us
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and a whole roof of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX> came off  and uh it was a eerie uh a real eerie blue green color
 	
 	
 		gosh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and the lightning was almost continuous just uh you know as if you put your hand on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of those electric uh things that causes lightning uh i think it was called the storm
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		
  
 		yeah that's it
 	
 	
 		but um the sky the whole sky was full of that eerie blue green uh lightning
 	
 	
 		wow
 		and that's about that's what we get this time of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> just all the way sometimes all the way through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June</TIMEX> the last especially the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last two years</TIMEX> it's rained
 		um what i think it rained <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">nine inches</NUMEX> in in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one one</NUMEX> of the Junes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last two years</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> usually we usually get <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about five inches</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX> and it's it's over that so
 	
 	
 		um
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		we haven't got that much <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rain</ENAMEX> but uh when it rains it's it's been down pouring
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		all right well i hope you have good weather the rest of the summer
 	
 	
 		you too
 	
 	
 		have fun playing <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">tennis</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">okay</ENAMEX> thanks bye
 	
 	
 		bye-bye
