 
     		
 	
 		how has your weather been recently
 	
 	
 		well <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last two weeks</TIMEX> we have had records  yes uh we've been we've had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between ninety and ninety five</NUMEX> degree weather with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about eighty six</NUMEX> to eighty <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">eight percent</NUMEX> humidity
 	
 	
 		record what
 		oh wow that's something we've had a really wonderful Spring it's been rainy
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's been comfortable it been cool and we've only had a couple of really severe weather storms uh which is unusual for northeast <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> generally we have some
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know there's there's always <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one or two</NUMEX> good hail storms before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the season</TIMEX> ends
 	
 	
 		yeah i know what you mean by good hail storms
 	
 	
 		yeah <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last Thursday</TIMEX> though it was just raining buckets
 		and it was probably in the low eighties
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		it was really a nice <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late Spring day</TIMEX> very comfortable just really was nice had plenty of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rain</ENAMEX> and within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three days</TIMEX> time
 		all of that moisture is gone the sun has come out and it is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H O T</ENAMEX>  i mean big time hot the air conditioners in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> are saying oh no not again
 	
 	
 		um-hum hm
 		oh yes i know unfortunately my air conditioner broke down uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two days ago</TIMEX> so uh things have been like a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sauna</ENAMEX>  uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		um-hum i can imagine well uh typically though what does your weather run when does your Spring actually start
 	
 	
 		well it's pretty Spring usually starts uh in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and we usually have seventy degree weather to seventy to eighty degree weather in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX> and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June</TIMEX> and then uh toward <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of June</TIMEX> it starts getting hot and uh hot
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		meaning you know ninety and above i consider ninety and above hot  uh and we usually have about the same humidity but unfortunately uh we had a very early Summer i'm i'm hoping that we'll
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		um-hum yeah
 	
 	
 		again maybe get some cool weather but uh i don't know uh it it doesn't look very encouraging because they're calling for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the rest of the week</TIMEX> to be equally as hot so
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 		
 
 		right oh boy i know that it's been <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about eight years ago</TIMEX> i guess now right here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		i guess it was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late May</TIMEX> temperatures got up into the nineties and by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early June</TIMEX> it was rocking <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred</NUMEX> and it stayed that way till <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		we had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ninety one</NUMEX> consecutive <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundred</NUMEX> degree days
 	
 	
 		oh my gracious wow
 	
 	
 		and i didn't know whether we would survive at all oh but
 	
 	
 		oh i guess not that's you don't have as much humidity though do you uh
 	
 	
 		well actually you know we affect our humidity a great deal this at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time wasn't a real humid area
 		but we've built a lot of lakes and a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">reservoirs</ENAMEX> and that increases the relative humidity i mean it if it's there to evaporate it's going to go up into the air and the hotter it gets the more evaporates
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		right
 		um probably put in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> and things too uh might uh uh it seems like the area there more treed seemed to um uh hold the humidity in uh even more
 	
 	
 		well we have attempted to reforest some areas but as a matter of fact at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time this was uh a very dense forest in this area and
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		for farming and for construction and things a lot of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">forests</ENAMEX> have been cut down and then of course you know they bulldozed a bunch of forest when they dug out the reservoir  moisture
 	
 	
 		yes i know
 		oh
 	
 	
 		but for the most part we have very mild <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Winters</ENAMEX> here we may get one snow storm i may actually see white on the ground <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one day</TIMEX>
 		but if it even ices <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">over a half an inch</NUMEX> worth of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> or just a little bit of snow man <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX> close down traffic comes to a snarl i mean nothing happens if it gets enough <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">snow</ENAMEX> you can see it on the ground
 	
 	
 		well don't feel bad it does here too and we get snow all the time  uh they don't get that awfully much but they get enough unfortunately that uh uh if if they aren't used to it it's not like having
 	
 	
 		um oh
 		yeah
 		uh-huh right
 	
 	
 		snow two you know uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">five inches</NUMEX> all the time or quite quite often they seem to be able to handle it when they have it like that but here uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> close when there's <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">half an inch</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">snow</ENAMEX>  and uh
 	
 	
 		right yeah
 		oh yeah
 		that's true they sure do
 	
 	
 		everything else closes down so uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum well you know the one of the things i have noticed is that the weather changes over time as well i was raised in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amarillo</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i can remember when there was really only one snow storm a year in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amarillo</ENAMEX> it started in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX> and stopped in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May April</TIMEX>  and it you know there stayed snow on the ground all <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Winter</ENAMEX> long to to sun depth
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but actually that has changed considerably uh the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Winters</TIMEX> are no less cold but they're dryer
 	
 	
 		right right yes it's been the same way here uh we haven't had nearly as severe uh a <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Winter</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last five years</TIMEX> even
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		than we had uh i've been in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maryland</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty years</TIMEX> so uh um i'd i'd say when i <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> came here you know it it was quite
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		common to have several snows and uh you know they they build in uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> snow <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> for our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> back here in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> and uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last three years</TIMEX> they haven't taken but one day
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		right
 		oh wow that's something well i don't think there was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a single day</TIMEX> out <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> for our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> they i don't they don't put <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> in there i think they put three
 	
 	
 		so uh it has
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but good grief here <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three days</TIMEX> for snow <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> actually <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one year</TIMEX> before last they took a snow <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX> because it was flooding  uh Spring flood and they just couldn't get to school so they just canceled school
 	
 	
 		okay
 		right
 	
 	
 		so there's just too many we're in a a very uh they're low hills you don't notice them because of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> and because of the so many <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> built around but there's a lot of hills around here which means there's a lot of gullies which means there's a lot of creeks and a lot of flooding
 	
 	
 		right
 		right right right
 	
 	
 		and uh  that can create almost as big a hazard and i drive a little <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> when it floods it drowns
 	
 	
 		ooh yes right you wouldn't wanna you wouldn't want to go through too many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">puddles</ENAMEX> do you have much uh many many problems problems with um lightning uh with electric storms there
 	
 	
 		well yes uh anytime there's a storm there's going to be plenty of it yeah one of the
 	
 	
 		oh really okay because of that that's one thing that we have here see i'm originally from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> so the contrast between
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		the lightning storms i experienced there and the lightning storms back here where it hits in the back yard you know uh uh have been uh quite an experience but um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh we seem to have a lot <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this time of year</TIMEX> we seem to have a lot of uh where it's still i mean last night it went down to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">sixty degrees</NUMEX> but it's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ninety</NUMEX> it's it's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eighty two</NUMEX> right now here so uh yeah
 	
 	
 		ooh goodness it really did climb fast didn't it
 	
 	
 		yes so it the the contrast in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spring</ENAMEX> is so uh you know different i guess that it uh breeds some uh
 	
 	
 		well i am a little bit concerned this <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX> our temperatures not drop down below the upper seventies at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> which means that you you know we could be looking for a very warm Summer i really don't want that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 		no i don't either i know what you mean because electric bills go up and  in fact uh i was at my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX>'s on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> and they had their <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> brown out uh it just electricity just went off for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about twenty minutes</TIMEX> and then came back on
 	
 	
 		oh
 		um
 	
 	
 		but it went off in the whole neighborhood so uh uh it's this isn't uh
 	
 	
 		oh my goodness
 	
 	
 		this is still <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX> it's not a real good time of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> to start you know because uh uh it kind of looks for the but the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Summers</TIMEX> have been longer and um hotter
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hu m</ENAMEX>
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		i think that a lot of it has to do with
 	
 	
 		i agree
