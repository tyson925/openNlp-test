 
     		
 	
 		
 
 		well hi <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bob</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		hi
 	
 	
 		hi um my lawn and garden <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">well</ENAMEX> that that's quite a topic because uh basically my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> takes care of it
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		um but what he's done is he's done a raised garden in the back yard because that we don't have dirt around here you understand that the it's it's sludge it's it's mud it's cruddy
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right right yeah that's the
 	
 	
 		so you know instead of uh trying to break every rototiller that we ever rented um we've just decided to do the raised garden and it works out great he just built like a twelve by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> box
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		out of um lumber that's you know the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wolmanized</ENAMEX> lumber and it's i guess it's maybe oh say <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">eighteen inches</NUMEX> wide so it makes a really nice <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">box set</ENAMEX> that on top of the dirt
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and then worked and worked and worked with the soil i mean bag after bag from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolfe Nursery</ENAMEX> to uh fill it up
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</TIMEX> it has produced some of the best <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetables</ENAMEX> and garden um you know type things that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		boy it's been really great and right now we have <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tomatoes</ENAMEX> out there and we've got you know have eggplant we're growing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">corn</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">corn</ENAMEX> grows great here so um we really enjoy that a lot
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh that's good uh
 		yeah well it's uh so far as vegetable gardening is concerned it has been uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many years</TIMEX> since i've tried any of that uh i we did have uh we've been in our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> uh where we're located now for about fifteen years
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about uh eight nine</NUMEX>
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about nine years ago</TIMEX> i guess we put a swimming pool in our backyard
 		which means we don't have a backyard anymore
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh so our our gardening is pretty much uh limited to
 		plants uh you know <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">shrubs</ENAMEX> and and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> that that kind of gardening
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh i
 		in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</TIMEX> that i did have vegetable gardens there were you know there were times when i had really good gardens and there were times when they just they weren't very good at all and i guess uh the soil and the and the bugs together
 	
 	
 		it's  it's amazing they come up well someone told me they they come in the in the uh packs you know the seed packages that's where the bugs come from
 	
 	
 		
 
 		sort of
 		um-hum yeah i wouldn't doubt that
 		uh i always like to try to grow squash and uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">squash bugs</ENAMEX> would would just go crazy
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah oh those oh yeah we've given up on those ourselves
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		and in in my experience with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tomatoes</ENAMEX> was that if i got <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tomatoes</ENAMEX> at all they usually got uh sun blisters you know or or it would rain on them and they would bust open you know when the heat hit them
 	
 	
 		yeah i guess we've got an early early grow variety or something like that and they're just now you know starting to turn red so before hopefully before all this heat hits
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		yeah but uh but there were you know there were <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> uh we i grew uh the little <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plum salad</ENAMEX> type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tomatoes</ENAMEX> uh quite a bit and had real good luck with those
 	
 	
 		we'll have some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tomatoes</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one year</TIMEX> at at a the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> we lived in before which was also here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Richardson</ENAMEX> uh we grew okra and i i picked okra up until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">almost Christmas</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		i know what you mean green peppers grow like crazy too around here
 	
 	
 		yeah and uh and i still i still occasionally will grow uh jalapeno peppers uh we we like jalapenos and they they grow real well too now you can just stick one of those anywhere
 	
 	
 		right yeah
 		definitely
 		right  right
 	
 	
 		uh
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the things that we're doing talking about uh about <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">lawns</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">shrubs</ENAMEX> uh we have a live <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">oak tree</ENAMEX> in our front yard
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and we just have more trouble getting grass to grow underneath that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and we're in the process or at least in the planning stage of of putting in a bed around that <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">oak tree</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i think that'd be really pretty really nice
 	
 	
 		uh right yeah we're going to just have a ground you know put ground cover and and maybe you know maybe a few low <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> under there
 	
 	
 		i think i think that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asian</ENAMEX> jasmine just is so aggressive it'll take no time at all to surround that <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> and probably your <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and your back yard and your pool  the way it goes
 	
 	
 		right
 		
  
 		and uh
 		right
 		
 
 		right we uh
 		uh uh we uh brought some <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> out we're from both from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East Texas</ENAMEX> and we brought some <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> in from there and uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one one</NUMEX> of the things that we brought uh unintentionally was uh violets
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		which is like almost like a ground cover
 		and they really spread they really spread out and grow uh pretty rapidly when they you know when they're growing well
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh
 		that would be a good idea
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		but they uh they are i guess uh not an annual but a
 		they they volunteer to come back <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every year</TIMEX> but they do die off during the winter i've forgotten what the term is for that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh but they do die back during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the winter</TIMEX> so that you know they are not really very satisfactory for a you know for a full ground cover because of that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well that you know one project we're looking at is we're building a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">deck</ENAMEX> out back and we want to put a tree in and we've been looking around and maybe you could you know suggest something but
 	
 	
 		but uh
 	
 	
 		um the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> that we've sort of you know come upon is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradford</ENAMEX> pear and we wanted it for shade and we wanted it for you know for the leaf and um that's
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		
  
 		yeah um i i don't i'm not familiar with that pear <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> uh but it's a non bearing pear is that right yeah
 	
 	
 		you know
 		right it does it's yeah it's ornamental
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> and then the uh of course the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">leaves</ENAMEX> drop off during the winter right so
 	
 	
 		right that's true
 	
 	
 		yeah we have uh we've had real good luck with uh and again these are like volunteer <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> that we transplanted from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">east Texas</ENAMEX> but we've got a couple uh well we did buy one though we have a couple of red bud trees
 	
 	
 		oh red bud
 	
 	
 		and uh we've got <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of those on our patio uh we've got a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rock</ENAMEX> and and around in our <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> area of our patio
 		and we brought a a red <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">bud tree</ENAMEX> in and it has done very well it has a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a</NUMEX> a little larger leaf than uh
 		maybe even than a pear <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> i know it's got larger leaves than a plum <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> has
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		the uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">leaves</ENAMEX> are probably uh oh <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">four inches</NUMEX> or so in diameter
 		and uh
 		you know makes a pretty good uh tree it
 	
 	
 		that would be a great shade tree then
 	
 	
 		it it has uh of course during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early spring</TIMEX> it has the red you know the red <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> that are really pretty
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh the only problem wit h it is it does have a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seed</ENAMEX> pod uh you know a little it's a little flat bean type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seed</ENAMEX> pod
 		that uh will drop off you know uh when uh when they start drying out so there's a little bit of clean up work for that
 	
 	
 		um
 		but as long as you mow the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">grass</ENAMEX> around well you said it was around rocks but
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah always it's
 		uh with with our in our case uh it's fairly close to our swimming pool
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and so the uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> uh uh blow in there they don't drop in but they blow into the swimming pool so there's a good a good bit of cleanup you know in the swimming pool from that but it's you know it's not too bad even at that so
 	
 	
 		well that's just in the springtime too isn't it
 	
 	
 		right and uh
 		but uh y eah we we've really enjoyed that uh the live <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">oak tree</ENAMEX> that we have uh is in the front and of course the live <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">oak</ENAMEX> is uh
 		it's susceptible to bending by the wind it it it leans away from the predominant wind direction
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and i think i think you'll find that uh we also have an apple <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> uh in our side <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">yard</ENAMEX> and it does the same thing the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">the southwesternly</NUMEX> winds southwesternly winds
 		which are predominant you know during the growing season make both of those <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> lean
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		toward the northeast
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh so it's but that's uh the live <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">oak tree</ENAMEX> that's you'll find that uh pretty much anywhere that there are if there's a grove of live <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">oaks</ENAMEX> growing they're going to be leaning away from the you know the direction of the wind
 	
 	
 		oh that's interesting get to know all these things
 	
 	
 		uh if you
 		if you go down along the uh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> coast there a lot of them grow you know down there and you'll see them and there'll just be like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty five or thirty</TIMEX> of them growing real close together and they'll all every one of them be leaning away from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> away from the from the water mostly
 	
 	
 		leaning away from
 		well that's interesting yeah i know that um we've done some other things with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">grass</ENAMEX> and trying to
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know get the right combination of grass here
 	
 	
 		right the uh
 	
 	
 		because it's
 	
 	
 		what kind of grasses are you growing
 	
 	
 		well we see  ours was a model <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> so when they set it up they had like these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cement</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">walkways</ENAMEX> across the front yard
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and they had planted bermuda and then when they took the cement walkways out they stuck in um what what is that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint Augustine</ENAMEX> stuff
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint Augustine</ENAMEX> right
 	
 	
 		and i am a transplant here from the north myself and so when i saw that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint Augustine i</ENAMEX> said oh <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">weeds</ENAMEX> and i spent i mean <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX> just pulling it up bag by bag
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		until i went to the nursery <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX> and found out they were selling it by plugs you know and i could have made some money on all those big huge black bags of stuff i'd thrown out so we're trying to um
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		after after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this winter</TIMEX> we had a lot of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> kill and hopefully you know some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bermuda</ENAMEX> will take over and because i really like that grass
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah what you what you will find uh with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Saint Augustine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">grass</ENAMEX> is it's very susceptible to both <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> and to grub worms
 	
 	
 		yeah that yeah the grubs
 	
 	
 		you know uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">the grub worm</ENAMEX> is the larva of the uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June</TIMEX> beetle
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June</TIMEX> bug beetle and uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">grub worms uh</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late spring</TIMEX> uh the the beetles come in and and they lay their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX> in the grass
 		and then the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">grub worms</ENAMEX> come out in the larva stage and they eat the grass off at the roots they eat the roots of the grass off
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and uh we we had <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint Augustine</ENAMEX> uh in uh our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">yard</ENAMEX> before i mean before we the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> we were in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">before</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one year</TIMEX> all of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint Augustine</ENAMEX> in our backyard died
