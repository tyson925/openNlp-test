 
     		
 	
 		
 
 		there we go um normally it takes me a lot longer to get through but this is pretty quick do you have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh
 		yes i do i have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh my goodness tell then you've obviously had some experience with child care
 	
 	
 		um both ends actually
 	
 	
 		really uh what do you mean
 	
 	
 		i tended in my home for about twelve years
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		uh
 	
 	
 		now what did you look for when you were looking for child care
 	
 	
 		when i was looking for child care
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i've never had to uh
 		uh it's been the situation where i had to
 	
 	
 		oh it it
 	
 	
 		put my own <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> in child care thank goodness
 	
 	
 		it um-hum
 		yeah that's nice
 	
 	
 		i was uh
 	
 	
 		lucky
 	
 	
 		i was um i've always been very grateful for that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		excuse me just a minute
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i'm sorry
 	
 	
 		that's okay
 	
 	
 		but it has been a a factor my youngest is now in a uh preschool which is different than
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		day care i guess you know per say
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		um
 		well what you know i work in a personnel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> and um so i'm constantly interviewing and placing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in jobs
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i've just really become discouraged in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>'s own sense of responsibility and dependability
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">um</ENAMEX> and what what's hard for me is i don't have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> but i would imagine once i do i'm probably going to need to find some sort of child care
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and it worries me it worries me a lot because i just um i i don't i don't know who i could feel comfortable trusting my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> with It
 	
 	
 		oh it's very hard it's very hard
 	
 	
 		it i yeah
 	
 	
 		i always felt like i ran a real tip top in home
 		child care i think there are advantages to to child care in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> but oh i'd be very very careful if i were putting my own <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> in a home
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		i know
 	
 	
 		they uh and even if you get a place that's just perfect just perfect you know it's clean and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are responsible and and the uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		the other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> are decent and there are programs provided and foods done properly and all those kinds of things that you think of you know to to worry about
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i
 		you know you your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> build bonds with those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> that are there
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and yet
 		and they're usually very young preschool age
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and yet when that's gone
 	
 	
 		um-hum  yeah
 	
 	
 		you don't you don't even know who those other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> are chances are they're like little <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cousins</ENAMEX> you know or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brothers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sisters</ENAMEX> and yet they never see one another again
 	
 	
 		i know oh i know
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so you know i think that's a
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		that's a factor too
 	
 	
 		oh it certainly is um
 	
 	
 		most of my uh i come from a family of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and um-hum
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		myself my own you know <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> my uh nuclear family
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and most of us have somehow been able to work out
 		either aunts and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">uncles</ENAMEX> uh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">siblings</ENAMEX>
 		you know older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">siblings</ENAMEX> younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">siblings</ENAMEX> you know some of us have  had <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> that were quite stretched out in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> or
 	
 	
 		that's great
 	
 	
 		situations where you know kind of joint where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> worked at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> or you know alternated or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> worked out of the home so he could tend the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> you know different things and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		not very many of us have had to actually have that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">full day every day</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		day care in a herd kind of situation and the one
 	
 	
 		not only yeah not only does that make you uh just have you know more peace of mind but isn't that great for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> too
 	
 	
 		i think so
 	
 	
 		to not be with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">strangers</ENAMEX> and even though they're you know getting to know the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and it's probably good for them to you know be out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and all that but just to have a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> with them so few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> are able to do that these days
 		that the fact that you're able to do it and and that your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">siblings</ENAMEX> could that's just wonderful
 	
 	
 		well and at the time that i was doing you know in home child care i i felt real strongly you know that that was a needed to be a real viable opportunity for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> to
 		to have that option that they didn't feel you know a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> cannot afford to have a nanny
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		or a governess you know type situation where that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		housekeeper someone in the home their own <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> is tending to their own <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		day in and day out that's just a luxury most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> can't afford if they could afford that they probably wouldn't be going to work except for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> who's got a career you know who's um i think more and more i think we're going to see
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		oh yeah
 		right
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		child care change i think there's going to be more corporate involvement i think we're going to see a lot more um
 	
 	
 		definitely um-hum
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">paternity</ENAMEX> leave and options that involve the dads more
 	
 	
 		definitely and we're going to see more like you were saying corporate i think we're going to see more uh maybe even a corporate contribution i mean just <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> helping to to pay for it because it's just not
 	
 	
 		flex times
 		yeah yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		well basically you know we already have my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> works for a large uh oil corporation
 	
 	
 		uh it's a necessity
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and they have you know a deduction kind of plan where it's tax free you know if you put it in ahead of time yeah
 	
 	
 		yes that's what we do here
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		pre tax dollars that that you're yeah that's that's what we have here
 	
 	
 		i think that's
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		and on site care
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		those kinds of
 	
 	
 		oh they do have on site care
 	
 	
 		no no they don't i'm saying i think that i s one of one way of the future that we will see
 	
 	
 		oh i'm sorry
 		oh
 		um-hum boy yeah
 	
 	
 		and and much needed i
 		i like to see those kinds of things that emphasize the family unity rather than
 	
 	
 		sending <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> off and
 	
 	
 		you know
 		because we just have a generation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that are not going to be happy with
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		either parent
 		not when and our economy is almost precludes
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> staying <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> if they stay home they've still got to contribute somehow
 	
 	
 		oh i know
 		um-hum yes
 	
 	
 		you know financially
 	
 	
 		yeah oh yeah um and and i guess you know it's just it's too scary to be reading the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX> and hearing on the news they always say that um you know
 		all these horrible things happen in the most comfortable places like uh sexually abused <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> it's happening with a neighbor or with somebody that they think they knew well and trusted um and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		they say probably eighty percent
 	
 	
 		that's the scary thing is that you think okay these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are good because you can trust them and and all that then they're the ones that might you know turn around and
 		and be the ones that cause the problem
 		it's it's really scary it's um
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		i my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> or i should say he will be a professor
 		and um i'm looking forward to his schedule being flexible and to mine and you know at some point being flexible so that we can sort of juggle our own schedules around and and create some sort of way that we can
 		be around you know not necessarily at the same time but at least one of us be there one woman that we have in our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> um he works during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> and she works in the evenings part-time
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and so you know even though she's only working part-time she's not spending money on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> care so it's almost like you're not um you know maybe you're not making as much but you're not spending as much either
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		i read the most interesting article here oh gosh it's been <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about two months ago</TIMEX> right around <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Easter</ENAMEX> time i remember thinking it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		was when i read it
 		<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about</NUMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> that honest and truly share the same job for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arco Oil and Gas</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		oh my goodness
 	
 	
 		i'm trying to think it was computer related they were both over a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> he worked <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one week</TIMEX> she works the next they have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		oh wow
 		isn't that ideal
 	
 	
 		how very unusual you know i mean for to find <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who even could do the same job or have the same education to do it but they'd met on site you know and
 	
 	
 		yes
 		right
 		right
 	
 	
 		the relationship developed and you know they married and
 	
 	
 		and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> that can allow that yeah
 	
 	
 		that would support it and the uh
 		and of course you always wonder you know when you read it in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX> is it really all you know
 	
 	
 		right  is this true or what
 	
 	
 		did they just ignore half the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> who can't stand this arrangements but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> that were interviewed all seemed to be very supportive of it and uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum  that is what a neat idea
 	
 	
 		and said that their that their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> styles meshed real well
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and
 	
 	
 		wow that's amazing
 	
 	
 		isn't that interesting very novel you know
 	
 	
 		yes that is very good i like that um it's
 	
 	
 		you know you hear of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> you know maybe like on flex time thing you know but you're talking file <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clerk</ENAMEX> i mean you know you're not talking
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah i know you're not
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know
 		both with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">master</ENAMEX>'s degrees yeah
 	
 	
 		isn't that interesting wow i would imagine that must be hard to to not bring your work home  though you know um they probably
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum our uh our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dentists</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife team</ENAMEX> work out of the same office
 	
 	
 		oh really oh
 	
 	
 		yeah and uh they have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		well that's that's good i mean if some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couples</ENAMEX> want to do that i think that's great and uh you you just got to change your life around somehow when you're going to have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> no question about it
 	
 	
 		that's
 		and yet it's worth it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it truly is worth it you know there are <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">some days</TIMEX> when you wonder if it is but you know face it you know the
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">population</ENAMEX> is decreasing you know and somebody's going to have these little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">babies</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		yeah um-hum
 		yeah now do you are your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> is are your older ones at an age where they're taking care of the younger ones yet or oh they are
 	
 	
 		oh yes my uh my big ones are wonderful to help with my little one and uh
 	
 	
 		oh good
 	
 	
 		we are we're to the point now where we only have one that has to be sat like you would say <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> sitting or tending but i still believe that it's very important that moms be in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> in the afternoon
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		when those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> come home from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> and stuff that's just
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know that's i think it's just as critical for middle school and high schoolers as it is
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
