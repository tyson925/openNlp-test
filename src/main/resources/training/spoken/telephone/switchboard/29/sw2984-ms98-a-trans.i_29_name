 		oh okay
 		yeah we're <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> okay
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and uh but grew up in uh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iowa</ENAMEX> on a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">farm</ENAMEX> with a considerably different philosophy in terms of  lawn and garden work uh and uh
 	
 	
 		hi
 		can you hang on just a minute thank you
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i have no idea he didn't broadcast thank you uh-huh  i'm sorry go ahead
 	
 	
 		no so uh
 		uh not not growing up familiar with here uh uh
 		when i get a chance i listen to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neil Sperry</ENAMEX> and do that  and uh
 	
 	
 		oh i do all the time i do all the time i get a lot of good tips from him
 	
 	
 		yeah uh
 	
 	
 		i have his book too um-hum
 	
 	
 		yeah don't do any uh any gardening in the sense of uh vegetable gardening but uh
 	
 	
 		not in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		tried tried tried some tried some different <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> and and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">uh bushes</ENAMEX> and stuff and uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh have a
 		have a lawn service there was one when we when we bought the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and we just continued with them for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a long time</TIMEX> and then switched to a different one but in terms of the fertilizing and uh weed control mainly leave that up to them what about you
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		well no i had a lawn service <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one year</TIMEX> and i thought phooey i'm going to do it myself because i figured up the cost and i said huh-uh i can do it much
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		cheaper and better and so what i did i switched to a liquid and i do it with an applicator with my hose and it's so much easier than taking that <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">lawn spreader</ENAMEX> and walking all over the territory i was surprised how easy it was
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		well
 	
 	
 		and it i thought well i'm going to do this all the time
 	
 	
 		well good
 	
 	
 		so i found you know and i've got some problems with uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> in my front yard and i took them to a certified uh nurseryman <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the other day</TIMEX> and do you know what he told me i he needed to do
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		no
 	
 	
 		which is at  it's just unreal he said i needed to pull every leave off
 		the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">fifteen feet</NUMEX> high and it probably has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about ten thousand</NUMEX> leaves on it
 		and he told me i needed to pull every leaf off and then <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spray</ENAMEX> it with this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemical</ENAMEX> that he
 		said i should purchase and i thought uh-oh  this is this is unreal this is unreal
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so uh i think i'll get my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son-in-law</ENAMEX> to do it for me if he will but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		what what what kind of a is this some sort of a disease or is it a pest
 	
 	
 		yes it's a disease that it's got and i don't know what happened to it uh and then it
 	
 	
 		what
 		well what kind
 	
 	
 		it um well
 	
 	
 		what kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> are they
 	
 	
 		well one is a maple one is um
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		a maple but i would much prefer i think it's not a native <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Texan</ENAMEX> tree
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh the one that the ones that really do well are the ones that are on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> property and they don't get any care and they're <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Cedar Elm</ENAMEX> and they're just beautiful
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so i mean it it's you know these things that you pamper
 		some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have really a green thumb and you know and um although i don't have
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		too serious a problem but i don't know if it was from the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the the late</TIMEX> freezes that were or the early freezes we had that caused this tree damage and you know <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sperry</ENAMEX> said you know that's what happened to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Crepe</ENAMEX> Myrtles
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last two years</TIMEX> that you we are looking at all of the freeze damage from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the prior two years</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so i kind of think that maybe that uh happened to these large <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> that i have
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i really hate to lose them but um
 		that's one of the hazards i guess of uh having a a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">yard</ENAMEX> because i
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah well that's that's one thing that we had we've had
 		very poor luck with with is in in our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">yard</ENAMEX> is is trees but the uh what what <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> were were there when we moved in uh uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		were had been put in by the
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">developer</ENAMEX> when he built the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and he just put in whatever was cheapest that he could claim was a tree i think yeah and uh
 	
 	
 		right the quick growing yeah and they and he
 	
 	
 		figured up <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">last night</TIMEX> at there were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX>
 		different <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> of of various <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kinds</ENAMEX> and sizes in the yard when we moved in and we got one left at this point but uh a couple of them we've lost to the wind weren't too good <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> we've lost to wind uh uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> we three we've lost to to uh freezes between uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eighty three</NUMEX> and uh
 		and then uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year ago</TIMEX> we lost uh
 	
 	
 		can i pick your brain about how you got rid of those <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> did are they still there did you cut them down at the at the ground level or did you pull them up by the roots or how did you get rid of them because if i
 	
 	
 		another one
 		well
 	
 	
 		i i don't know how to get rid of these big <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> because one has a circumference of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about ten inches</NUMEX> and
 	
 	
 		yeah well we didn't have we didn't have any that were that
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		that big when they uh went <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of them uh  the wind the wind blew over uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		oh
 	
 	
 		in in terms of getting them down uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		because i don't want stubs in my lawn because you still have to
 	
 	
 		but yeah yeah now the the one that the one that we lost
 		the last <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> that we lost a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year ago</TIMEX> uh up up until then they don't hadn't been big enough but what i just
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		used a hand saw and sawed them off at at as close close to ground level as i could and then
 	
 	
 		the base to the ground um-hum
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">uh</ENAMEX> got some got some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemical</ENAMEX> that you drill holes and pour in that helps
 	
 	
 		bore
 		i see try uh a stump killer yeah uh-huh
 	
 	
 		helps rot the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stump killer yeah stump killer</ENAMEX> and stump stump rotter but uh this last <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> had a fair sized root and some guy
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		was doing a job in the neighborhood uh and and saw it and stopped in and asked if i didn't want the stump dug out on the spot for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty five</TIMEX> bucks and i said fine and he had he had a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trailer</ENAMEX> with a machine on it that was specifically for that and it
 	
 	
 		yeah and they get that saw and i think it's a kind some kind of a screwing a screwing thing that just rips it right out
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah and it it just it just ripped it right
 	
 	
 		right out yeah
 	
 	
 		right out and uh
 		i took the it it left the it left he left the chips and i
 	
 	
 		used those for uh mulch sure
 	
 	
 		put them up
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mulch</ENAMEX> around around around the other <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">shrubs</ENAMEX> and uh
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">uh</ENAMEX> had had a pile of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dirt</ENAMEX> from various things uh
 		back by the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garage</ENAMEX> that i filled in with and and it's filling in with with grass uh nicely <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> so that that was that was worth it but uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blessing</ENAMEX> in disguise i mean you two fold purpose yeah

 		lawn yes um-hum yes i have a i have a self-propelled uh Snapper
