 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		if you don't cook though what do you like to eat if you go to a dinner party
 	
 	
 		well uh i'm uh a bit of a seafood <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lover</ENAMEX> i suppose uh i have a health problem in that i my <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> is high
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		so i'm in the in the process of bringing that down so i don't eat a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beef</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pork</ENAMEX> or almost none
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so i would say most likely a dinner <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> would be you know would include some kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">seafood</ENAMEX> or you know or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">poultry</ENAMEX> type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dish</ENAMEX> as the main course
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		well uh i was just thinking as i was listening to this recording go over and over till they found a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> for me to talk to  i could talk about a dinner party i had uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		
 
 		right
 	
 	
 		and it included some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seafood</ENAMEX> so that would probably be uh appropriate for you
 	
 	
 		well uh that sounds good
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh i had uh some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> visiting and they are uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fans</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> shrimp
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so i did a kind of a stir fry dish with shrimp that you shake up in a bag with a little parmesan <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cheese</ENAMEX> and flour and then uh quickly
 		uh fry up in a little olive oil and then uh take out of the wok put some uh red strips of red pepper and green pepper in
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		stir that a little bit uh add some uh sliced <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mushrooms</ENAMEX> and then put the shrimp back in with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a half a cup</NUMEX> of white <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> and just bring it to a simmer
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and then you serve it on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX> and it's really a a pretty low <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol dish</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yes that sounds sounds really good uh
 	
 	
 		because its done with the uh shrimp and the olive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> you don't use any kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beef fat</ENAMEX> or
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		right yeah
 	
 	
 		no no animal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fats</ENAMEX> in it
 	
 	
 		right and that's
 	
 	
 		And it's very popular and it looks very pretty and uh with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salad</ENAMEX> you've got a a meal
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right that that really sounds good
 		uh i'm a a uh
 		frequent as frequent as possible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traveler</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Orleans</ENAMEX> area and so we eat a lot of seafood my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> and i eat a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seafood</ENAMEX> when we go down there
 	
 	
 		um
 		oh that's a good place to get it i miss it i lived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Houston</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a long time</TIMEX> and  we loved to go over to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Orleans</ENAMEX> to eat
 	
 	
 		and uh yeah uh
 		oh did you
 		
 
 		but uh we we have not been there uh since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last summer</TIMEX> but uh it's we're looking forward to going back as soon as as we can
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh but we eat eat a lot of shrimp and uh eat oyster dishes and uh
 		we like uh things like uh the poor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> sandwiches with the fried oysters on them course i'm not supposed to eat fried oysters any more but that's uh we like that that and uh love gumbo
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		oh yes
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		oh i wish i had the recipe for my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandmother</ENAMEX>'s gumbo she used to make the most wonderful crab <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meat</ENAMEX> gumbo with shrimp and all sorts of other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">goodies</ENAMEX> in it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right yeah
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		goodies in it My job was picking the crab
 	
 	
 		oh yeah so uh
 	
 	
 		not my favorite part
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but uh but i guess uh my like i said i'm not a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cook</ENAMEX> so my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> probably does or does definitely do you know all of the cooking for you know when we have a dinner party uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i help with with what i can and uh you know we don't have uh
 		uh something on the order of what you had uh you know it don't main dish and probably some kind of a starch and a vegetable
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh we eat a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX> and and uh the the bell peppers that you uh sauteed are just right up our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">alley</ENAMEX> we eat a lot of that a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mushrooms</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		well the reason for using those is that it makes such a pretty colorful dish <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> always exclaim when you have the red and green peppers and if i'm making a whole lot uh i use a yellow pepper as well
 	
 	
 		right
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		for <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">one pound</NUMEX> of shrimp i use <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> red pepper <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> green pepper and oh maybe <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half a dozen ten</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mushrooms medium sized mushrooms</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and that's plenty for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and if they're light <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">eaters</ENAMEX> you can squeeze in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">six</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		yeah if you if you wanted to uh put a little crunchiness in that uh throw <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a few cashews</NUMEX> in it
 	
 	
 		but
 		oh yeah that's good uh my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cook</ENAMEX> he doesn't do much cooking either but he loves to cook <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> and he has a marvelous uh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chicken</ENAMEX> with cashews and
 	
 	
 		yeah but uh
 		right and uh
 		right the cashew <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chicken</ENAMEX> is is i i really enjoy that
 	
 	
 		and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Szechuan</ENAMEX> peppers now those are not the hot ones those are the little round pink ones
 	
 	
 		oh yeah just
 		right
 	
 	
 		and oh they are wonderful that uh he does that uh uh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chicken</ENAMEX> with cashews and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Szechuan</ENAMEX> peppers and he also not at the same meal
 		does a wonderful vegetable <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dish</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Szechuan</ENAMEX> peppers but use that uses either <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">asparagus</ENAMEX> or um
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right yes
 	
 	
 		let's see what does he use <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">asparagus</ENAMEX> is the one we like the best oh broccoli you can do the same <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dish</ENAMEX> with broccoli and also if you're really in a pinch you can do it with just celery
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah we uh we also uh uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cook</ENAMEX> on a do an occasional dish with uh some kind of a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> theme
 	
 	
 		and it's pretty good
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh we you know have discovered that you can make you know just as good a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> food with uh
 		with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chicken</ENAMEX> or with even with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">turkey</ENAMEX> we we do cook a lot with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">turkey</ENAMEX> and it you can come out with you know good spicy <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> food
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh and make it chicken or or <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">turkey</ENAMEX> or something like that instead of going with the beef like when we make <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fajitas</ENAMEX> we can make you know chicken <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fajitas</ENAMEX> and and enjoy them just as well
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh i like them too i think they're great uh we i've been trying to convince the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cook</ENAMEX> at uh at the place where i work uh we are kind of isolated and so we don't go out to lunch very often
 	
 	
 		yeah and uh
 	
 	
 		and we do have an excellent kitchen uh which is encouraging for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to stay around and uh eat and interact with one another at lunch we're a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">think tank</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so that's one of our functions is to  get <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to talk to each other and she has started cooking uh much healthier food much much more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">uh salad</ENAMEX> without <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mayonnaise</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh much more
 		main dishes without <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oils</ENAMEX> and uh and vegetable i mean and uh animal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fats</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		so i think we're improving our diets i don't know whether it's the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> influence or whether it's everywhere but
 	
 	
 		well i think it's everywhere i i i know that uh
 		oh probably <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least half</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that i know are on some kind of a low fat diet for one reason or another or are low <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fat</ENAMEX> or no fat
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		well my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> is not real high but he his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> had uh an early <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart attack</ENAMEX> and so he is very conscious of his
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh physical condition and he walks a lot and tries to get uh to stay in pretty good shape and to watch out for high <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> and
 		since i prefer the kinds of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> that one eats on a moderately moderately low <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> diet anyway that suits me just fine
 	
 	
 		yeah we have found that uh since we've stopped eating so much <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beef</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pork</ENAMEX> that when we do eat it it tends to upset our systems
 	
 	
 		um yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh you know it's uh my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> in particular when she uh she said you know when she eats uh some kind of a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beef dish</ENAMEX>
 		if it's the the least bit spicy along with the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beef</ENAMEX> itself that she really her you know her stomach really acts up so
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so we eat uh eat very little <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beef</ENAMEX> and uh we just
 	
 	
 		yeah we don't either we just eat it once in a great while and uh it's usually if we're having <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> and it's somebody that we know is a big meat  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fan</ENAMEX> but there're fewer and fewer of those
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		right yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so we also do an awful lot of cooking when it's just the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of us on a little tiny uh  grill it's
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh it's less than a foot long and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about eight inches</NUMEX> wide and we just put a few charcoals in there and uh we can cook a piece of chicken we buy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">boneless chicken breasts</ENAMEX> and save us ourselves a lot of time
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		And that with uh do have you ever tried <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lawrey's Lemon Pepper</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		you can buy it in the grocery store
 	
 	
 		yeah i i don't know whether we've tried that or not i i know we've got a we've got a uh is that uh the salt
 	
 	
 		it's a
 		well it has sea <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX> in it
 	
 	
 		yes i think we've got a
 	
 	
 		but it's not the same as they have the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lawrey</ENAMEX>'s seasoned <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lawrey</ENAMEX>'s seasoning <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lemon Pepper</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lemon Pepper</ENAMEX>'s the one i love on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chicken</ENAMEX> and fish
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh yeah just
 		barely brush it with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil grill</ENAMEX> it uh so it's not too done and sprinkle a little of that on it and then i add <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">some lemon thyme</NUMEX> from my garden
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and that makes an excellent and very easy to fix
 		dinner
 	
 	
 		yeah you know it's uh <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about fifteen minutes until noon</TIMEX> here and we're talking about food and i'm
