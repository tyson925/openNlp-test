 		okay i live in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Plano</ENAMEX> in a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> bedroom
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> bath house which is the area's dominantly <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> bedroom <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> bath
 		so i'm just a little bit different than typical
 		uh
 		and of course
 		the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Plano</ENAMEX> area is basically with alleyways
 		so everything around here is
 		set up that way
 		which i think is little a little bit different than most areas in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> the way they're constructed and it's a brick <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> with uh some wood
 		it's real nice i like it  how about you
 	
 	
 		well i i certainly hope so we have a a classic ranch
 		up in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Denton Ranch</ENAMEX> style home i should  i would hate to think that anybody thought i
 		the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lot</ENAMEX> we live on is a ranch uh
 		it's in a subdivision
 		and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> story
 		it started out life as a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedroom house</ENAMEX> and now has no <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> car <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garage</ENAMEX> and has
 		uh the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> extra <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> enclosed i suppose we still only have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> effective <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedrooms</ENAMEX> but we gained a playroom for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> and an office
 		out of enclosing the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garage</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		are most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> in your area three <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedroom</ENAMEX> two bath
 	
 	
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost a hundred</NUMEX> percent
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i i can't think of any <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedroom houses</ENAMEX> in the subdivision
 		ours is probably the closest to it
 		you know how realtors are they'll say oh this could be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> bedrooms
 		yeah if you had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that don't have any clothes it could be a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedroom house</ENAMEX> don't need a closet
 	
 	
 		yeah me too
 		the only thing about mine um i think there's probably about
 		oh when i go down the street i can just pick out <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> that are that are identical to mine and usually they are the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> bedroom
 		um but they're spaced out
 		oh i'd say maybe <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three or two</TIMEX> block period
 		because it's all different <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">builders</ENAMEX> up here
 		so it's kind of hard at that point to you know classify some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">builders</ENAMEX>
 		but most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">builders</ENAMEX> all built <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three two</NUMEX>
 		but the one thing my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> is a little bit different and i can pick it out again because it's not typical is i've got the
 		oh what do you call it a uh
 		double ceiling double high
 		in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one half</NUMEX> of the house
 		so like the den and the living room
 		are all double cathedral ceilings
 	
 	
 		uh cathedral ceilings
 	
 	
 		and uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen</ENAMEX> is norm and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedrooms</ENAMEX> are norm
 		so it just goes down the dining room
 		the family <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> and the living <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> that way
 		and i love the space
 		it just
 		it's uh luckily
 		i came from a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colorado</ENAMEX> which had the cathedral ceilings
 		and i just lucked out and walked into this one and of course i felt the same airy feeling which i liked it real well
 		so it's a nice thing to move into but
 		again it's not typical in this area
 		you can just spot them because the ceiling the roof is so high much higher
 		but uh
 	
 	
 		well i hadn't thought about it in that sense of the high roofs
 		we have cathedral ceilings in uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> and the uh
 		family <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> and in the master bedroom
 		those are are pleasant
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well it's like when my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> goes up into the
 		up into the furnace area over the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garage</ENAMEX> he can walk and he's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> foot and he says oh come on up mom i'm not going up there  i'm not going up there but he says there's plenty of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> up there for a room
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so that means if i knock out the wall
 		in my family <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> i could make another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">room</ENAMEX> overlooking my family <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> from upstairs
 		with no problem
 		but um i'm not that ambitious
 		i told maybe someday
 		when i feel really ambitious and then get angry i'll start poking holes up there but until that time
 		but uh i've noticed the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> around here are basically it's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> story
 		and they're all basically two
 		uh bath <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> uh with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedrooms</ENAMEX>
 		and we're ninety i would say about
 		oh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about ninety five</NUMEX> percent no i guess maybe probably <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred</NUMEX> percent of them all are mostly brick
 		uh with some wood
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		it's basically all brick the next subdivision over from me is total brick
 		and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> on the other side of me
 		is about the same as mine
 		but uh the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> on opposite the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> now they're total brick and they're basically <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost all three two</NUMEX>
 		they're all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three two</NUMEX>
 		but of course they have a little river going down their area too which is kind of nice
 	
 	
 		if it's the kind of river i'm thinking of better them than than us you know
 		are you talking about a real river creek
 	
 	
 		no it's a creek they've put little fountains in and such
 	
 	
 		well that's nice uh i came from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mississippi</ENAMEX>
 		recently and the rivers that we had there were the ones that came with the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rains</ENAMEX> and
 		they didn't pay any any attention to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		that kind of stuff so you're just as likely to
 		wake up and discover you're in <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">two inches</NUMEX> of water
 	
 	
 		do you have a lot of property i mean a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">yard</ENAMEX> around your <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">now</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Denton</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh it's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a third</NUMEX> of an acre i don't think that's a lot
 		uh in fact i have been real disappointed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the six years</TIMEX> that i've lived out here about lot sizes
 		i'm more accustomed to a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">one acre</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lot</ENAMEX> being a standard and the two acre being
 		what most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have
 	
 	
 		yeah when you get down closer in to the newer <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">track homes</ENAMEX> you find almost like there's no lot line at all they're built practically on top of each other
 	
 	
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		i know i was
 	
 	
 		and an and while while there are some advantages to that  there's less time spent outside making it look nice and taking care of things uh
 		i just feel
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hemmed</ENAMEX> in
 		by that
 		it's not as comfortable a living
 		for me
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		well this subdivision here has got
 		oh there's enough to put
 		oh i'd say uh
 		what twelve feet between each <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> on each side well i've got more on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> side than i've got on the other
 		but i'm like you i came down from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colorado</ENAMEX> and there was more land up there around the yard
 		with a big full back yard which here i look out my back yard and i can see the gate i mean the fence is right there i mean just don't run too fast or you'll hit it
 		and i'm not used to that either
 		i mean i could see <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> putting swimming <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pools</ENAMEX> in the back yard all around me but
 		to me you put the swimming pool in your back yard and you've lost your back yard
 	
 	
 		entirely
 	
 	
 		i mean uh sure i mean you've got a little place on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> side or the other but
 		but to me their not that big enough for a pool but you know they're going up so
 		but it's uh
 		it's great for mowing
 	
 	
 		
 
 		from from that aspect you're right and and it doesn't take nearly as long to get out there and weed it by hand and that kind of stuff
 	
 	
 		but yes i'm used to uh walking out the back yard and you can play catch across the back yard and you've got plenty of room to even play a small game of <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">baseball</ENAMEX> but
 		don't do it around here
 	
 	
 		no the one that's
 		sort of what drove me to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Denton</ENAMEX>
 		when i <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> came out here in
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eighty five</NUMEX> i started looking and it seemed like the further i got away from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> center
 		uh the more lot came with the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and and the lower the price at the same time
 		and it just seemed like there was a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten thousand</NUMEX> dollar drop for each city
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i hadn't thought about it that way
 	
 	
 		so
 		so moving up <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five</TIMEX>
 		i stopped when i got to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Denton</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it just well see now with our jobs mainly hitting downtown <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> we couldn't go too much further but we  we went that way it was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> and the
 		cost of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> so we kept going out until we figured we hit a point where we need the traffic time to get into work and that's where we stopped it was the thing same problem
 		but i think <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Plano</ENAMEX> is so very different
 	
 	
 		you all both you all both work downtown
 	
 	
 		i got laid off by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TI</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 	
 	
 		oh well
 		this is a wonderful thing that you that you're doing here still helping them out
 		uh but you were working downtown
 	
 	
 		oh i
 		no i was working at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> site
 		my ex-husband was working downtown
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		but i uh uh
 		no <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> as far as i'm concerned they've been great as far as layoffs is concerned so i have no problems problems
 		but as far as the housing i would like personally i would like to move out of a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedroom house</ENAMEX> and go with something smaller but prices in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Plano</ENAMEX> there isn't um
 		there isn't a section in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Plano</ENAMEX> you can really move to without getting caught
 		and uh
 		if
 		my price <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">right now</TIMEX> for what i pay
