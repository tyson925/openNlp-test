 
     		
 	
 		
 
 		okay
 		okay are you currently active in any type of exercise program
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		you're not
 	
 	
 		no i get enough without having to do it
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		if i exercised i'd be too thin
 	
 	
 		is that right
 	
 	
 		uh-huh i just have one of those metabolisms that um
 	
 	
 		doesn't require exercise
 	
 	
 		doesn't require it really if i if yeah
 	
 	
 		i i wish i had such luck
 	
 	
 		well i think you kind of are born with those type of genes
 	
 	
 		my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> is that way i uh
 		course i've always uh i've always been in fairly good condition but and i do exercise uh lately i've been off of it because i've had shoulder problems but uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		that seems to be on the mend and i think i'm pretty close to getting back on a program again
 	
 	
 		well i did have a program of walking because i enjoyed doing it in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the evening</TIMEX> and i had a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> at that time and i walked him
 		and i kind of lost <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">like ten</NUMEX> pounds and i said whoa  better stop
 	
 	
 		i do notice as i get older i i tend to i you know i don't exercise like i like i used to
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and it's much much harder for me to control you know the few pounds here and there
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so whenever i do have to lose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> pounds whatever it's a major effort
 		whereas i could used to just lay off <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two or three</NUMEX> meals uh
 		you know for a day or so and then you know i could lose you know <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> pounds
 		now i'd have to do that for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two solid weeks</TIMEX> before i'd lose <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> pounds so
 	
 	
 		well my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> really uh is into uh fitness uh of course she's in uh the nursing profession and she knows how beneficial it is even though she says <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mom</ENAMEX> you
 		you know you really need to exercise because it does a lot for your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> other than maintain your wealthy your weight
 	
 	
 		um i think it's important when they when they talk about you know getting your heart rate up and
 	
 	
 		yes and and she has a very strenuous um
 		exercise mode that she keeps herself in plus she has um a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> that she takes care of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">and a forty hour</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">work week</TIMEX> so i'm really amazed at her stamina
 		but she um has inherited uh a little problem from her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>'s side because he did have a weight problem
 		but he maintains his weight now because he jogs like uh <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">nine miles</NUMEX> a day
 	
 	
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah and he gets that adrenalin high and i guess that really i've never reached it  um
 	
 	
 		i used to run uh you know quite heavy i used to i used to run like <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> and maybe <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> miles
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> times a week
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but uh over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</TIMEX> of the pounding and everything else my knees just don't support it any more
 		so i've i do walk and i do ride my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bike</ENAMEX> and we do have a workout <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> here at work and i do i used to be on a fairly rigorous uh weight lifting program and and uh riding the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bike</ENAMEX> the stationary bike
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh but uh then i started i think it was just from
 		trying to lift too much
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i started getting the shoulder problems and uh so i've been off now for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about four months</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		well i think the old adage is quite true in this case with exercise that moderation is the key
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		if you know your limits and you stay within those limits i think that you and you're happy with the exercise that you do because i think it's um very imperative that you have a happy
 		um attitude about exercise otherwise it becomes a chore and a task and and you you think of it as work and um
 		it doesn't
 		really uh do a lot for you but if you think of it as a uh
 		a source of uh well being and health and uh uh have a positive attitude i think you you go a long way with that
 	
 	
 		the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> thing's i mean i enjoy doing it i i enjoy any kind of any any kind of outdoor uh activity exercise whatever and in fact i used i do it during lunch i i really look forward to it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh i did overdo it and i know it and i keep trying to tell myself that i'm not <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty years old</TIMEX> any more i can't i just can't keep up and uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um</ENAMEX>
 		yes
 	
 	
 		i and i've got to learn just you know when i get to a certain point i use use it to maintain i'm not i'm not after
 		uh you know the uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty year old</TIMEX> body any more i'm not uh
 		i'm just not geared that way
 	
 	
 		you're just uh focused then on on maintaining your health because if you do the exercise naturally you're going to feel a lot healthier
 	
 	
 		yeah on just staying in condition and uh
 		but i had my uh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> was down to
 		it was
 		i think around <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred</NUMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty two</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh that's good
 	
 	
 		yeah very good my my blood pressure was real good
 	
 	
 		that's very good
 		
  
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh my uh percent body fat was less than eighteen percent
 	
 	
 		well that's marvelous
 	
 	
 		so i mean overall i was in very good shape <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">now</TIMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four months</TIMEX> of being off exercise i've put on probably fifteen pounds
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		wow
 	
 	
 		and taking on you know taking on quite some bad habits of snacking and everything else so i know i've got a major event
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh once i get back i think probably <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">within a couple of weeks</TIMEX> i'll be able to get back to it again
 	
 	
 		well i think the way you're talking now that you're already motivated for that goal
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i know it's got to happen uh i'm i'm slowly growing out of my wardrobe so i have no choice i can't afford a new one so
 	
 	
 		oh sure
 		okay
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		but it's
 		it's something i've done pretty much all my life i uh i played college ball and and i've i've always liked
 		staying in shape and it just really bothers me when i'm not
 		so uh
 		and and and plus it's just important
 	
 	
 		i think it does a lot for your mental um exercise too uh keeping um a clear mind i think your mind is clearer when you exercise
 	
 	
 		well i sleep better at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> i think clearly you know i'm
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		doing something
 		uh
 		i just
 		i have real poor self-esteem if i know that i haven't done something
 		i just feel lazy and i feel like i've cheated myself
 		and and i've gone through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four months of that</TIMEX> and i'm kind of like you know it's time to get back on
 	
 	
 		yeah and you'd have yeah
 		you've
 		you've beat your head yourself over the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> long enough
 	
 	
 		yeah i i hate it i really do i hate it
 	
 	
 		yeah sure
 		yeah and it has an effect on your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> life too
 	
 	
 		that too and  like i said my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> is one of those you know she could sit down and eat a whole choco late cake
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		uh-huh  not show
 	
 	
 		and and never never show a an ounce of it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and she's got <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of those fast metabolisms my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> does too
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i see them eat
 		and then i'm of course i'm impelled also
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		that just that that seems to be the worst the worst thing i have a problem with is i tend to like food way too much
 		and uh back when back when i was working out when i got home i didn't tend to want to eat this much i was i came home i felt satisfied i'd get out and work a little bit in the yard i'd come in i'm hot
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i'm a little bit tired and i'd just and i'd just grab a a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salad</ENAMEX> or a snack or something like that and then
 		that would be the end of it
 	
 	
 		well uh one of uh eating is one of the joys of life you know and uh
 	
 	
 		it is for me
 	
 	
 		yeah well it is for a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and uh you you surely should get satisfaction out of eating you know because you socialize and you're maintaining your your body uh you're you're maintaining all of your
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> faculties that run the body your brain and your flesh and your bones and all of that and eating is a pleasure
 		that is one of the basic uh motivators in life is eating
 	
 	
 		yep that's for sure
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 		but uh
 		i've got to get on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">wagon</ENAMEX> and i know it but i like i said i mean i uh
