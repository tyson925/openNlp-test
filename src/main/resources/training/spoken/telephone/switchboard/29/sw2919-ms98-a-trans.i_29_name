 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		have you had any thoughts on this
 	
 	
 		well not really uh
 		i uh am of an age where i could have very well served in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">military</ENAMEX> during the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Vietnam</ENAMEX> era and i did not
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		how old are you if i can ask
 	
 	
 		huh do what
 	
 	
 		how old are you
 	
 	
 		i'm will be <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">forty nine</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		okay so we're about the same age
 	
 	
 		right uh
 		during that time i was in college and uh and also had some minor health problems that did keep me out of the out of the military or or help to keep me out anyway
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but uh i'm not opposed to military service at all
 	
 	
 		yeah i think this is also a a broader scope i think uh they're talking about uh just service in general and um
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i i did a lot of this sort of thing in in college in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summers</TIMEX> um i worked uh in uh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> doing community service for uh for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two summers</TIMEX> while i was in college and you know it was an incredibly worthwhile experience
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so in theory i'm am favor of this but on the other hand i'm an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and uh just like uh well the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">military</ENAMEX> has a tremendous uh you know responsibility for security and everything but there's also an equally tremendous budget
 		so i guess on the other hand as as as as good as this idea is it's got to be paid for
 		uh even though it's uh you know it it's it's never quite voluntary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have to be paid if they're asked to serve for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> in any capacity
 		so uh you know uh uh the idea's great where does the money come from
 	
 	
 		right i guess uh uh i've had i have had some thoughts in the past that uh this this service should not be uh performed for for areas that we don't need the service you know uh it's if it's uh
 	
 	
 		and
 	
 	
 		if it's voluntary service but it's being furnished by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> it should be to take the place of things that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s doing already
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		it should it it should or shouldn't it should um-hum
 	
 	
 		should right
 		so uh you know the the the voluntary service in the medical you know
 	
 	
 		but i don't think it was it was voluntary i think it was just the required year of required service there was nothing about voluntary
 	
 	
 		oh okay yeah then then then i guess that's you know uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that's why as an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">economist</ENAMEX> my my my ears perked up
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		uh at at any rate i guess my idea is that that
 		if we're going to replace if we're going to to institute this national service policy that that service policy should replace some other area
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		where we're spending money uh you know uh you know eliminate eliminate some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bureaucrats</ENAMEX>  and let the let these national this national service take care of their job
 	
 	
 		and doing it at a less expensive rate then
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		of course you'll probably get another whole layer of bureaucracy running it
 	
 	
 		right and uh
 	
 	
 		i mean let's face it the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">military</ENAMEX> is probably one of the most bureaucratic agencies
 	
 	
 		right yeah
 	
 	
 		so i i i you know on the one hand my immediate reaction to it was oh it's wonderful you know i think <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> do owe their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> something whether it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		they serve in the military or for those who for for one reason or other can't want to serve in another area and have talents in another area
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		great but then who pays and if they have to and they don't go into the labor the other labor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> you're losing money in terms of taxing
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right
 	
 	
 		from other jobs i mean so there's it's not it's not a real cut and dry
 	
 	
 		yeah i agree uh it and and it would uh would be nice if we could get some uh some multiple use out of this you know maybe uh
 	
 	
 		thing
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		have the the military which is you know is is is a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a</NUMEX> a real drain financially on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> have the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that are in the military serve some other function you know instead instead of just military uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		and just marching around waiting for a war
 	
 	
 		right uh
 	
 	
 		yeah uh we did have something similar to a volunteer thing with uh which was volunteer although volunteer there was a minimum payment uh like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vista</ENAMEX> which was a domestic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peace Corps</ENAMEX> some time back
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and probably coming from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> you may have bumped into some of that
 	
 	
 		yeah i have seen uh you know i'm not really that you know that familiar with it i am aware that that that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vista</ENAMEX> and uh yeah
 	
 	
 		oh
 		yeah and i know the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX> what's the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX> has a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">corps</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineers</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		which uh could probably be one of those areas that uh could be uh privatized or civilianized or whatever some of the areas there you know for domestic use
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i've always wondered why the army <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">corps</ENAMEX> of of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineers</ENAMEX> took care of floods you know in in certain areas why was
 	
 	
 		right it's well i guess uh in in in looking at that one reason that the army <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">corps</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineers</ENAMEX> is that uh the military schools
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		do have probably among the top engineering <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		but of course there are many private engineering <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> that are absolutely superb
 	
 	
 		right
 		but uh but if if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s going to uh to provide the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">service</ENAMEX> then government you know <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> trained <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are are logical to do that uh
 	
 	
 		yeah they made
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah and of course back during the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">depression</ENAMEX> when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> started doing things like uh CCC the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Civilian Conservation Corps</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so i uh you know there's a bit of a history of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> serving the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> and it doesn't have to be as the military you know if you go in just as a as an enlistee uh the wage isn't anything great
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		so if if you're asking for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> of service it doesn't have to be a wage comparable to the uh
 		if it's a required <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> it doesn't have to be a wage comparable to the private sector so it could be you know a wage enough to for have someone to live on to eat and if uh if in fact
 	
 	
 		right right yeah
 	
 	
 		so i guess that it a lot of thinking would have to be done if it were implemented
 	
 	
 		well and it
 		right it
 		yeah uh yeah i guess uh basically i'm you know i'm in favor of uh of the idea but
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i think that uh like you said a lot of thought needs to go into it just uh the financing and and the the uh the yeah
 	
 	
 		how it's administered and how you know uh just the who uh who who would be exempted because i'm sure there would be exemptions to it
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		but uh you know medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">service</ENAMEX> and uh uh aid aid you know or or assistance for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> and uh
 	
 	
 		uh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh even uh even uh running the uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prison system</ENAMEX> might be a you know
 		a a an area  that could run could taken be taken care of
 	
 	
 		um-hum or even  or even  doing paperwork for a police <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">systems</ENAMEX> you know
 	
 	
 		right uh there's any number of things that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s involved in
 		that uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah
 	
 	
 		that this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">service</ENAMEX> could take care of
 	
 	
 		homeless <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homeless</ENAMEX> and all
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i think they're going to cut us off
 	
 	
 		well i think that's my call waiting line ringing whoever that is will probably call back
 	
 	
 		oh oh
 		yeah but i think you know in terms of the the the crime pressing problems in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> that in terms of the homeless in terms of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of the the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prisons</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um there're there're probably a lot of things that could be done uh on a volunteer basis so maybe they should do pilot <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">projects</ENAMEX> to try it out to see how it works
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah
 		right and uh just to see what uh what all could be done yeah it's uh nice talking to you too okay bye-bye
 	
 	
 		yeah well listen it was good talking with you
 		okay bye-bye
