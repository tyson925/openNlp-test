 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		okay
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hi</ENAMEX> do do you have lots of credit cards
 	
 	
 		yeah we well we have quite a few but we don't really use them a lot we have well we like a lot of gasoline credit cards because we like to be able to stop you know when we're traveling and stuff wherever there's a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX> but as far as like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MasterCard</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Visa</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		we don't use those too often
 		what about you
 	
 	
 		um i used to have a ton of gas credit cards and now i have one or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of them but i think i've even let some of them expire but i was living out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> for a while so i wasn't using them too much and i don't drive that much but i have
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MasterCard</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Visa</ENAMEX> and you know i have a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MasterCard</ENAMEX> and an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Express</ENAMEX> now i got rid of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Visa</ENAMEX> because it was getting out of hand having <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fifteen million</NUMEX> cards but as long as like my
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MasterCard</ENAMEX> is um free as long as you spend about i don't know <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">three thousand dollars</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> or something like that and so i tend to buy almost all major purchases on a credit card when i have the choice
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and um i used to even use it for my grocery shopping and stuff the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> around here don't let you do it too much
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		and so i don't but i was living in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> and there you pay for everything by credit card but it's not really a credit card
 	
 	
 		huh
 		oh is it like an automatic debit or something oh huh
 	
 	
 		it's a it's a debit card yeah
 		and um just you know it's  many times you get out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX> faster if you pay with that than if you pay with cash  bye thanks  um yeah because they're just so well set up with it
 	
 	
 		really
 		yeah we use our credit cards sometimes for a big purchase but we always have the money
 		set aside already to and then we just pay it off <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next month</TIMEX> we never pay we don't like to pay interest on the credit cards at all
 	
 	
 		right well
 		yeah i i never pay finance charges on them except when i screw up which i occasionally do
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and you know i'll forget to pay the bill by the due date or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this last month</TIMEX> i mailed the check to them on the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty second</TIMEX> and they didn't get it until the thirtieth and it was due <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the twenty fifth</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		gosh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and
 		yeah so i thought i and so i got hit up with a credit uh finance charge on it which pissed me off
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		because um
 		you know i really did mail it in time
 	
 	
 		right yeah
 	
 	
 		but
 		they have no proof of that i don't i don't want to i'll probably talk to them some more discuss it but i i never um
 		usually never pay finance charges
 	
 	
 		yeah that yeah we we screwed up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time like that too we mailed it and they just never did get it and we had to finally mail them another check
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i had that hassle <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time and
 		i that went on for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> because and they eventually found the check and
 		deposited it and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months later</TIMEX> they were still telling me that i owed them finance charges and um late fees and things like that and i said well i mailed you a check and you eventually did deposit it
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		so you know
 		i guess i don't know who the the burden of proof is on
 	
 	
 		yeah i don't either
 	
 	
 		you know it's kind of a
 		because you never do when i pay bills i don't make a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Xerox</ENAMEX> copy of it or i don't
 	
 	
 		no you figure you'll get your check back if you have to
 	
 	
 		um
 		right or i don't get a i don't mail them all a signed receipt whatever i you know at the bank
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		to have a proof of when i mailed it
 		and i mean you can't do that it'd be ridiculous
 	
 	
 		really i like to use my card if i buy something through the mail which i don't do real often or something from out of state you know where if something's wrong
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		you don't want to end up having to pay for it <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a couple</NUMEX> times i've had to write big credit card <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> and say you know i didn't really get this or
 	
 	
 		well you can
 	
 	
 		i don't know what this is
 	
 	
 		right or i returned it so don't charge it yeah well that's basically what happened with us is we bought a computer and the computer um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		didn't wasn't didn't do what
 		these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> said it would do we need to just put external cards in and it wouldn't do that so he brought it back to them and they're supposed to modify it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and so i called the credit card <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> and said well we haven't really taken possession because it's not useful for us we can't use it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and then they said well then don't pay it
 		and then <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a month later</TIMEX> i had to dispute it in writing and i was out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> and got back and i took care of it as soon as soon as we got the computer back and it was okay i mailed off a check but then it was too late so now they're hitting   with a finance charge
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		but it's sort of you know it's it's half our fault
 	
 	
 		yeah since it well yeah if you filed that letter with them then they'll kind of
 	
 	
 		and so we
 		right if i had filed the letter to dispute it and then paid it eventually it would have been okay
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so i learned that for the next time
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i am like you too about the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yearly</TIMEX> fees i don't uh i don't like to pay the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yearly</TIMEX> fee for a card right now both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MasterCard</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Visa</ENAMEX> we don't have to pay a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yearly</TIMEX> fee on and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		since we don't pay the interest it doesn't really matter what the interest rate
 	
 	
 		right yeah
 	
 	
 		is to us as long as we don't have to pay that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yearly</TIMEX> fee now we had <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Express</ENAMEX> cards
 		and
 		my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> had always had that before we got married and those got so high we finally decided
 		for him and me both to have a card it was like ninety dollars or something like that i can't remember but we decided let that one go and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> and i both have that and i don't know what we pay for his card i pay i think i have a gold one so i think it's like seventy <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">five dollars</NUMEX> for me
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i'm not quite sure what it is for him but i had really like
 		there
 		nowadays i'm not sure so sure that it's worth it but um in the past there you know there are some places that only take <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Express</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and then
 		they don't have the credit limit because i've over done the credit limit on the other card if my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> and i both travel
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		if it you know a couple of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> tickets and a little bit more and you're over the limit on the credit card
 		and um
 		with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Express</ENAMEX> they say there is no limit there really is but they tell y ou that but then that was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> advantage but that's that's like
 		i don't i think it's seventy <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">five dollars</NUMEX> for me and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">forty</NUMEX> for him
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> which is a lot
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		be
 	
 	
 		but yeah like you said if you really if you need that extra for charging tickets and stuff
 	
 	
 		yeah well we should probably get another um <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Visa</ENAMEX> card yeah one another one that's free because there are some like i think <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT&T</ENAMEX> has one that's free if you make <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> purchases a year
 	
 	
 		it's more worth it
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh
 	
 	
 		well so
 	
 	
 		yeah that wouldn't be too hard to do
 	
 	
 		yeah and so that's easy enough to do and if that's true that's um it might be better off to have that as a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> card just to have the credit
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and get rid of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Express</ENAMEX> because it costs so much
 	
 	
 		have you ever run into problems of charging up more than you meant to and having to be stuck with that we've never had that problem either
 	
 	
 		no
 		no
 		i and i don't understand i mean i guess i do understand the mentality of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> doing it but i don't understand
 		yeah because <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> think it doesn't really cost them anything to pay i have had <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> where i was shocked at how much had come in because like i thought i would buy a big expense and think that it would take <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one or two months</TIMEX> to process
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and sometimes it comes in right away and it's like oh well i guess i have to pay that too
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		because like many times i'll try i'll buy some things towards <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the month</TIMEX> thinking hey i won't get that bill until the next bill not this bill and it will come in on the next one you have to pay for it right away anyway
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but sometimes the  is long like i've had things that i didn't get billed on for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two or three months</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah i guess it depends on whoever you buy it from how fast they turn them in or something lot of places have
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		those i guess they're called those pointed sale terminals where it's like it goes in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the minute</TIMEX> you charge it yeah
 	
 	
 		immediately yeah but that's what happened with us like we bought a washing machine <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven months ago</TIMEX> and then i got billed like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next day</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh gosh
 	
 	
 		it didn't matter because we couldn't have paid for it by check but we prefer  like with the credit card you get the automatic um <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one year</TIMEX> guarantee so if something breaks things like that
 	
 	
 		yeah that's nice
 	
 	
 		you can uh return it so like the washing machine
 		we bought it in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX> and
 		you know if something goes wrong with it within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first year</TIMEX> we've got an automatic guarantee on it besides the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX>'s guarantee
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and somethings like that are
 	
 	
 		yeah i like that feature and the insurance like if you break it yourself even you know if you buy something that's breakable
 	
 	
 		right
 		or if it gets stolen or if you lose it or whatever it might be and so so that's you know another advantage and then even things like airline tickets you automatically get flight insurance which um you hopefully you never use but like if your baggage but things like if your baggage gets lost
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you get money for that
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		to buy new bags and things like that
 	
 	
 		oh i didn't know that
 	
 	
 		and yeah when you rent a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> you get that and sometimes you get discounts with the cards and so
