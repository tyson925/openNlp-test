 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">auto</ENAMEX> repair
 		was my my uh alternator went out i have a nineteen <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eighty six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toyota</ENAMEX>
 		uh it's a little Tercel
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and uh i have a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> whose real good with uh repairing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX>
 		so i got him to take the alternator off and take it and uh
 		you know get a replacement part
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		we went to a uh
 		a a place called <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Quality Auto Parts</ENAMEX> an and their parts are
 		supposed to be guaranteed and and everything and they're
 		they're uh very reasonable so uh i bought the alternator we put put it on the car
 		and it it didn't work and it blew out all the fuses
 	
 	
 		oh no
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		how much was the alternator
 	
 	
 		uh
 		i believe something like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixty nine</TIMEX> dollars something something on that order
 	
 	
 		did he did he hook up the wire wiring wrong
 	
 	
 		no he hooked it up right
 		it it was just that the the part
 		just just didn't fit the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> so
 		i took it back and uh he he took the alternator the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> in in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parts shop</ENAMEX> took the alternator and he put it on the little thing he has in there to test them
 		and uh he said there was nothing wrong with the alternator so we we went back and tried it again
 		put it on again and it still didn't work
 		and we took the car up to um a little place called <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Pep Boys</ENAMEX> i don't know if you have them in your area
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but uh they're
 		they're pretty reasonable uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> repair <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">place</ENAMEX> also
 		so uh took it up there
 		towed it up there because it you know wouldn't start or anything and this thing just kept blowing out the fuses
 		and uh took them about an an hour
 		to um figure out what was what was blowing the fuse and it was it was the alternator that was blowing the fuse anyway
 		ended up taking it to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toyota</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealer</ENAMEX> and the only problem was that uh it had to be a genuine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toyota</ENAMEX> uh alternator
 		because most of the other ones that they say will fit it
 		that that you know they sit in there and everything but there's just some little difference that
 		um
 		causes it not to work
 	
 	
 		uh-huh they probably built that in so they could make money
 	
 	
 		and i
 		yeah yeah i guess so and that was my that was my last experience
 	
 	
 		well i had a weird there's a little sensing device uh in front of my
 		um
 		um i'm not sure right in front of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fan fan</ENAMEX> it's a it's an air conditioner sensing device i don't know why
 		it actually there's a metal piece that fits through the belts uh
 		and somehow that broke off
 		and uh i i still can't figure out how it broke and uh
 		anyway so a this piece obviously um i have a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Subaru</ENAMEX> and uh
 		i think you can only get it through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Subaru</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealer</ENAMEX> etcetera so
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh this little sensing device costed like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixty</TIMEX> bucks
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh goodness</ENAMEX>
 		are you able
 	
 	
 		and and i haven't had too many problems with my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> i got a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eighty eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Subaru GL XT</ENAMEX> and it uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> and then you know just basic maintenance and oil changes an i and i do not do my oil changes and i will not do my oil changes i've
 		i think the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time i tried to do one
 		ended up
 		um trying to get uh you borrowed somebody else's jack and i did this and i went and bought everything so after buying the filter and all the oil you're looking at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> bucks at least or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">somewhere</NUMEX> in there an
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh and then to go to the trouble
 		that i figured
 		it's easier spending eighteen bucks at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jiffy</ENAMEX> Lube
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so that that's um
 		you know  as far as any maintenance on my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> that i shy away from the oil changes that's for sure
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		well my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> is uh it's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an eighty six</NUMEX> and i really hadn't had any any trouble with it until until that and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> now has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred</NUMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> something
 		<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">thousand miles</NUMEX> on it and uh
 		and this was just recent
 		so i really can't complain about this one
 	
 	
 		how did you put that many miles on it in
 	
 	
 		um well i used
 	
 	
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four or five years</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		i used to work uh it was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a seventy mile</NUMEX> trip everyday
 		you know <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> ways was seventy miles
 	
 	
 		oh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">forty mile</NUMEX> trip
 	
 	
 		no it was it was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">just seventy miles</NUMEX> yeah
 	
 	
 		oh thirty <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">five miles</NUMEX> each way yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh i did that for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about three years</TIMEX> and it really it really added up
 		i've only taken uh
 		maybe <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> trips that were about <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">four hours</TIMEX> long down uh
 		down to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shreveport</ENAMEX>
 		and uh the rest of it was you know it's just basically driving a long ways to work
 		and now i drive like <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty twenty</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">three miles</NUMEX> each way
 		so
 		i'm getting a little a little uh little relief but still i drive a long ways
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but i guess because they're highway miles
 		you know it's not so bad on your <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> as
 		as if it you know were just
 		regular street
 	
 	
 		uh-huh do you work for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know
 		yes i do
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		do you
 	
 	
 		i was going to ask you you know as far as how we're getting compensated for what we're doing right now
 		um i don't work for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> and i'm just i get these green
 		i don't know what you want to call them fake
 	
 	
 		points
 	
 	
 		point things
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		and uh i just wondering how i go about
 		getting my cash
 	
 	
 		uh there's a number that you call it's the same number that you that you call to make a call
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		you you call that number and and uh
 		somehow or another they'll give you an option to leave a message and you can leave a message
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		i know someone that did that you leave a message and they'll they'll call you back
 	
 	
 		okay
 		all right well that's good to know i haven't been doing this this is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time i've been called in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a long time</TIMEX> and i haven't been doing it so
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		and uh i've done it maybe twelve times
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		well i don't know if i've done it quite that much but uh
 		mine is mixed up too i have to call and get it fixed
 		
 
 		um
 		uh let's see before i had this car i had a um
 		um i bought an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Audi</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five thousand</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but i bought it i bought it used
 		i i just bought it from a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> who was going to who just charged me what the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealer</ENAMEX> was going to give give him for it for a trade-in
 		and uh
 		it had a whole lot of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">miles</NUMEX> on it i i figured maybe i'd get <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one or two years</TIMEX> out of it an i an i did get a couple of good years
 		out of it and the uh
 		the engi ne messed up on me
 		and then i gave it to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> to repair who works for the automotive for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Audi</ENAMEX> dealer
 		and uh he took the engine apart and
 		you know he just said he couldn't fix it so the engine never got put back together again
 	
 	
 		huh
 		oh well
 	
 	
 		i
 	
 	
 		i was driving a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixty six</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Plymouth Fury</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		wow
 		i think those old <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">yep</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		might might be a pretty good bet because you
 		i don't know i
 	
 	
 		oh that that's when they made <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> though this things was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> was in good condition and  you know it ran fine it was starting to burn some oil
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		um
 	
 	
 		and um
 		but i had to
 		you know get you know i
 		after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about three couple of months</TIMEX> after i was out of college i finally splurged and bought my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> so
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		i read a book <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time that said that the best <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> were made before <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">seventy four</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well you know these
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> made in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the sixties</TIMEX> and stuff i mean the steel i mean the thickness i mean it those thing they're just
 		the you just don't see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> like that and they last <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a long time</TIMEX> and they were simple too the engines were simple and durable and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> will still buy them you know they'll
 	
 	
 		yeah it's easy to
 		it's easy i guess it's still easy to find engines for those <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> engines and transmissions
 		and if you i guess if you keep trading changing them out you can keep a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> for a long time
 		course i guess i could do the same thing with the the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toyota</ENAMEX> that i have
 		i just don't know how much they'll  charge me to
 	
 	
 		it always costs so much to fix anything or do anything with it you're just better off buying another car
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i guess so but i just think they cost too much in the in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> place
 		now a days
