 		i've tried weight training i just i just can't get into it  no it
 	
 	
 		really it seems so pointless
 	
 	
 		and it well i don't like having the sore muscles i like to run jog
 	
 	
 		do you
 	
 	
 		yeah i i used to jog <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about six miles</NUMEX> a day and then i i tore the ligaments in my ankle so i i don't really run that much but i i i jog some <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about a mile</NUMEX> or so now
 	
 	
 		oh my gosh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		when i have time
 	
 	
 		yeah i know i'm not real into like aerobics are anything like that
 		only exercise when i have to i mean
 	
 	
 		yeah that's that's basically me
 	
 	
 		you know i'm kind of i'm really bad about it
 	
 	
 		i'm i'm i exercise more in in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">spring</TIMEX> than i do um like this time of year because
 	
 	
 		yeah when the weather's nicer is it really
 	
 	
 		it it's too cold here  yeah well i i i think forty degrees is too cold so
 	
 	
 		yeah  little cold for you
 		i know that's how i am too because i i love going outside and stuff when it's warmer and stuff but otherwise i won't i mean i won't go work out or i won't jog i won't go outside i'll just stay at home you know on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couch</ENAMEX> watching TV or renting movies or something
 	
 	
 		yeah that's that's basically what i do i like  i like to um
 		to walk too i i guess they said it's a good form of exercise i guess uh if you consider that exercise i walk a lot
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		do you
 	
 	
 		but i i have such a normal fast pace so it i don't really i don't really think it's
 	
 	
 		it it's
 		it's nothing  or it could be your exercise for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the week</TIMEX> right
 	
 	
 		right i because i mean i i've always walked fast so i i don't know i need to get on a some kind of exercise program though because i'm i'm starting
 		to gain weight i'm getting at that age where  you don't need to start putting on the pounds
 	
 	
 		oh listen to you uh-huh they'll catch up with you
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah it it has caught up with me in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past year or so</TIMEX> i've i've put on about
 		<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">twelve pounds</NUMEX> so i need to work and get it off i thought about doing a diet but i really don't need to diet i i just need to
 	
 	
 		really
 		exercise
 	
 	
 		exercise i think
 	
 	
 		yeah it sort of that does make you feel better though i had to admit that you know after
 	
 	
 		yeah because when i get off work i usually come home and fix dinner and watch TV and then i'm tired i take a nap whatever
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah see after work i don't know  i think if i worked <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all day</TIMEX> there's no way i would do anything
 	
 	
 		oh i work i work <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eight to five</TIMEX> so i mean
 	
 	
 		yeah so then when you're home you're like okay i just want to relax and not think about work and definitely not exercise you want to eat
 	
 	
 		right i i do accounting and and it's on a computer <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all day</TIMEX> and i'm so brain dead when i get off work it's kind of like just don't even talk to me just let me sit here and vegetate so
 	
 	
 		yeah you're probably drained and probably exercising probably wouldn't help
 	
 	
 		well i don't i don't know  i they say once you once you get in a routine of exercising it gives you a lot more energy energy i know when i ran
 		um i kind of got like addicted to it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know you see these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> um i never was die hard you know they they had a story on the news about uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> becoming addicted it's like uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that do <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> it's it's a high for them
 	
 	
 		that have to do it
 		see i've heard that
 	
 	
 		i've got a couple uh uh a real good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> of mine that i went to school with lives here too she works for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The News and Observer</ENAMEX> and she's the one who got me started running in in college and i i was never
