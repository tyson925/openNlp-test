 
     		
 	
 		what kind of camping do you do down there
 	
 	
 		well we have gone to several places
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um there's a real nice <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">area</ENAMEX> north of here close to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oklahoma</ENAMEX> border
 	
 	
 		do you
 		do you have a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camp</ENAMEX> trailer or do you just take tents and sleeping bags um-hum
 	
 	
 		no we take tents
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tents</ENAMEX> and sleeping bags
 		is what we use
 	
 	
 		take the whole family
 	
 	
 		yeah we do uh we haven't gone in a while because we have a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three year old</TIMEX> and we're waiting for her to get a little bit older but we have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> and we take them
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh it's fun
 		i mean we're not avid <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">campers</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but um
 		i guess our the funnest camping trip we had was was when we went up north
 		close to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oklahoma</ENAMEX> border that's north to me  um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and we stayed for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about three or four days</TIMEX> and the weather was very nice that's one thing you have to consider down here because in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX> it gets so hot
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		that you know nobody wants to do anything
 		um
 		oh uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time we went to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arkansas</ENAMEX>
 		and did some camping
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i'd almost forgotten about that
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six years ago</TIMEX> i guess
 	
 	
 		
 
 		do do you go up in the mountains or mainly stay in campgrounds
 	
 	
 		well we didn't really have any just second  what
 		is it getting worse and worse
 		okay
 		um
 		uh no we really didn't go up in the mountains
 	
 	
 		you basically just go with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KOA</ENAMEX> campgrounds or something like that
 	
 	
 		well this was a uh it wasn't a KOA what was  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frazier</ENAMEX> what was that that we went to in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arkansas</ENAMEX>
 		it was a park it was a state park
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah it was a state park
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">um</ENAMEX> and they had trails you know that we could go on
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh we were going to go on the river but the river was so high <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that year</TIMEX> it'd been raining so much that they wouldn't let anybody get on the river
 	
 	
 		huh i'll be
 	
 	
 		yeah there were a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">snakes</ENAMEX> around
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		oh it was <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Snake River</ENAMEX>
 		oh <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Snake River</ENAMEX> with a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">snakes</ENAMEX> in it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		my experience at camping is a little bit different um we do we do do a little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> camping but  i do a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">elk</ENAMEX> hunting with uh bow and arrow elk and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">deer</ENAMEX> hunting
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		and uh so i i we go back into the mountains using <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horses</ENAMEX> and and uh go and we'll pack in sometimes as far as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> miles
 		back in just on horseback and we'll stay for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten days</TIMEX> and
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		and that's a lot of fun but it's it's not real uh conducive to taking my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> uh she doesn't appreciate being away from civilization that long and
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh no electricity and no you know we you you take a bath in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">creek</ENAMEX> and freeze to death while you're doing it but uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh my gosh that's really roughing it
 	
 	
 		uh it is but it is fun
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		of course i guess it takes the right personality
 	
 	
 		have you only done that once or you've done that several times
 	
 	
 		no no i've done that lots of times
 	
 	
 		you love doing that huh
 	
 	
 		yeah it's in fact i as far as i'm concerned i don't get enough
 	
 	
 		really oh wow
 	
 	
 		um but
 		we'll probably go during the summertime on uh like a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-dayers probably <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> times and then as soon as fall comes on and the hunting season starts
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh we usually get <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> big one and then <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> big one that'll last probably <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten days</TIMEX> and then <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one or two</NUMEX> small ones for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two or three days</TIMEX> at a time
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">um-hum  TI</ENAMEX> switchboard
 		well you've done a lot more camping than i have actually my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>'s the one that's really the avid <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">camper</ENAMEX> he you know has a lot more experienced and and he makes it a lot of fun for everybody though because he knows
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		when you when you go with someone that's experienced and knows how to do things and it's a lot often fun for everybody else
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and
 	
 	
 		yeah i agree it's it's always fun to go with somebody that knows how to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cook</ENAMEX> over an open fire that's a little that's a little different than uh you know heat control at home and and uh uh you can have some lousy meals out there or you can have some great meals um
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh yeah</ENAMEX>
 		that's true when we were in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arkansas</ENAMEX> we'd been camping for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about three days</TIMEX> i guess and i was already tired of sleeping on the floor
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and we ran into a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX> that told us about a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">resort</ENAMEX> area up there and we checked into one of these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">resorts</ENAMEX> and got to sleep in a
 		a nice bed and that that was
 		camping the right kind of camping to me
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well it makes a difference we're we're set up with uh camping cots and uh and uh uh self inflating mattresses and and and things like that and then and then it's not so it's still not like <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> but it's uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		right makes a little bit more comfortable
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah do you have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> that you take along
 	
 	
 		yes well yeah but they don't come on the big trips they're very small too i've got a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a six</NUMEX> a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three and a about a one one and a half</NUMEX> and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh wow you've really got your hands full
 	
 	
 		yeah and they they enjoy the day ones we'll run up in the mountains like uh when i get off work sometimes and we're not we're not very far we're forty <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five minutes</TIMEX> from some
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		some real nice mountains here and we can go up there and build a fire and cook hot <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> and that's really not camping though that's kind of a picnic's what that is but but
 	
 	
 		oh that's great
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but they enjoy that
 	
 	
 		that's great
