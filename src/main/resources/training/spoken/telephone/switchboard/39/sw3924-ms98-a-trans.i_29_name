 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		uh go ahead
 	
 	
 		what are we supposed to discuss again
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> research is something that that i think that whether our <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> is putting enough money into it and actually i'm concerned that they're not
 	
 	
 		more money less
 	
 	
 		i have a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> who is working with uh who works with uh travel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> and one of the ones that he's worked worked with was <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX> who came in for an <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> uh conference in uh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and these were from other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> from other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> he's a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">translator</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and in talking to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> he said you know he says <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the things that really concerns me is your <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s not telling you enough about how pervasive and frightening this epidemic is
 		and they're letting the information out slowly about how
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		you know how big it is which is scary you know it's pretty scary when so many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> get it so i guess i'm i'm i'd like to see us spend more i don't know that spending more always gets it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i'm i'm ambivalent about it because um
 		uh
 		it uh well it is very frightening and scary i have no perspective on how it relates to other diseases
 		and uh i mean whether
 	
 	
 		you mean more money for that means less for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> or yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		yes
 		and uh whether those diseases can you some difference could be made if you did pour more money in like <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> research uh didn't uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know but
 		i uh then part of it's lack of education i don't know whether whether you know where our money would be most effectively spent
 	
 	
 		well it i i agree with you there because i know every time that it it something comes into vogue all the money goes to that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> and you don't know whether it's still also going to the other or if it's a limited pie
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		money from
 		money for taking care of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">infants</ENAMEX> takes money away from taking care of the elderly or do they both get served uh that's a good point
 	
 	
 		and i'm i am concerned a lot about uh
 		i'm concerned about uh
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> things one is preventing the spread and the other is for uh for uh treating the illness
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i'm not certain i i again this i'm telling you basically i don't have any opinion but whether or not it would be uh our money would be better spent uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		teaching you know working on the drug problems and the and the sex problems uh rather than trying to cure the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that already have it
 	
 	
 		well and one of the things i'd and i'm with you that i don't know is is that really the only way it's being transmitted or was that the easier way to tell us and we're going to find out more
 	
 	
 		yeah well you know the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dentist</ENAMEX> whether my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dentist</ENAMEX> or
 	
 	
 		uh that's that's the part that
 		
 
 		that's the part that scares me you know i mean beginning with this is this is just for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homosexuals</ENAMEX> well no it's for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homosexuals</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gays</ENAMEX> well no actually it's i mean you know did they know that all along
 	
 	
 		and and i heard something <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the other day</TIMEX> this sounds ridiculous about <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes</ENAMEX>
 		and you know they've been saying oh no absolutely not can't get it from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes</ENAMEX> and uh and now they're saying well maybe in the right conditions yes
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and i don't know that's true or not i mean i just heard it in passing but
 		so what does that what does that mean for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that you work with and shake hands with and
 	
 	
 		right
 		and how is it really transmitted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et</ENAMEX> cetera which is i think what they also don't know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i mean that's i think they they told us what was convenient and felt safe to say you know it was nice to isolate it to one particular <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX> that they have trouble
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know they just as soon not approve of anyway but but that isn't how it was in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX> was the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> and and had nothing to do with that and it's huge over there so i i you know and it's beginning to other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> that's was his point this was an international conference
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are saying well but in my <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> it's you know like this and does that mean like flus
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		i mean i don't know
 		all i'm saying is i think it's scarier than we know uh or maybe they understand but
 	
 	
 		i think maybe more information should be given out about it
 	
 	
 		yeah and uh and then the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that have it it does seem that there are are some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> that are there that you know they keep holding back if you if i were dying i'm not sure i would care
 	
 	
 		i i give me cyanide i mean is it   uh-huh
 	
 	
 		yeah right  i'll take anything you know i mean if i'm dying if i know i'm dying you can experiment on me go ahead
 	
 	
 		right
 		exactly and why can't you why can't the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> say you know if if these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> knowingly consent to be research <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkeys</ENAMEX> and well let them let them do it
 	
 	
 		yeah exactly
 		yeah yeah and that's i think what they're saying too
