 		hi
 	
 	
 		uh been wondering what you've been wearing to work lately
 	
 	
 		well i tell you what my going to work clothes has changed over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a period of years</TIMEX> i used to work in an office and i would and i thought that i would have to have a lot of clothes
 		because when you go and work around a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> for some reason i just felt the need to have a a nice variety and look and look different
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		now i work in an office in my home and i'm doing office work and i go out and call on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in their homes i sell insurance
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so i could wear the same thing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every single day</TIMEX> and it really wouldn't make any difference so and sometimes i do that it's just very very strange and different
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that's
 		that must be nice
 	
 	
 		it's a different feeling i get up and i i dress as i would go out to an appointment even if i'm going to stay in my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> for most of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day or half of the day</TIMEX> i just get up and get dressed like i was going you know out
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but it is this strange feeling to really realize that i really don't need
 		a large wardrobe
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		and um that i can go and and i could wear the very same thing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every single day</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		that's neat
 	
 	
 		how how do you do what
 	
 	
 		oh i usually wear dresses or suits i work as an engineer
 	
 	
 		yeah well i i wear dresses or suits too
 	
 	
 		and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mine</ENAMEX> doesn't really vary that much from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX>
 		uh i guess i wear a little less in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX> time a little more in the winter
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know or with a suit i i tend to wear a sweater in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the winter</TIMEX> as opposed to a blouse in the summertime
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		have you always lived in this area
 	
 	
 		no no i grew up in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX> and spent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several years</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX> going to school
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		well it seems to me like maybe <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fifteen years ago</TIMEX> i've always lived in this area and it seems like <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about fifteen</NUMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty years ago</TIMEX> i would see more of a significant difference in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seasons</TIMEX>
 		and um i had a tendency to really buy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wool</ENAMEX> clothes for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the winter</TIMEX> and really make a a definite change
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and it seems like the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last few years</TIMEX> i've had a tendency to even though i want to continue that it's just kind of been a pattern
 		i have i really don't wear my wool clothes any more so i've really had to make a concerted effort to buy lighter weight clothing and and and now most of my suits will wear all <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all year</TIMEX> around
 	
 	
 		yeah i think it's a lot of that is because of the fabrics have changed so much
 	
 	
 		well it i'm i it i just wonder if it's the fabrics or if if there's been that much change in in uh the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seasons</TIMEX> it seems to me like we're not having as cold a weather in this area as we used to have <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many years ago</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah well i've been in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> area for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about fifteen years</TIMEX> and i remember some ice storms and there was nothing you could wear to be warm enough
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		
 
 		but uh you know i i've got all these woolens from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX> uh because well i wore a heavy coat and a scarf and gloves and a hat
 		all that stuff
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		long underwear when i was going to classes
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well i just i had a trip to uh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colorado</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December</TIMEX> and i took really you know warm clothes in fact i bought a down jacket
 		so that i would have something warm enough and i didn't need anything i mean it just happened to be <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the week</TIMEX> that i was there it was just really nice and pleasant so
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		now i've got a nice new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">London Fog</ENAMEX> down jacket that i'll probably never wear
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		unless i go back to to uh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colorado</ENAMEX> and the weather's bad
 	
 	
 		yeah well
 	
 	
 		i remember who you are now
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah i've placed you
 	
 	
 		it's hard sometimes isn't it
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but that's funny too i haven't talked to as many of these calls as we've made i haven't uh talked to anybody else in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Altrusa</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">club</ENAMEX> before
 	
 	
 		i have i talked to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Susan Linnstaedter</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		is that right i'll be darned well um
 	
 	
 		yes
 		but we didn't get to talk about clothing
 	
 	
 		yeah well right well um
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		i was trying to think of something else that we might talk about about clothing
 	
 	
 		well do you do you i was wondering about when you dress for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> like if you have a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">club</ENAMEX> meeting that <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</TIMEX> just keep wearing the same thing i usually do
 	
 	
 		yes i do too i just don't change uh and a lot of times i come in and in the evenings and i change directly to you know like what i'm sleeping in and my robe
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that's terrible but i just
 		it seems like there's <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">only a few hours</TIMEX> there and i just want to be totally relaxed of course if i know uh if i know i going to go out or run to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX> or something well i'll just i'll put on something
 	
 	
 		i
 	
 	
 		you know jeans or sweats or something like that but normally
 		i do that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about three or four</NUMEX> times a week is just come in and
