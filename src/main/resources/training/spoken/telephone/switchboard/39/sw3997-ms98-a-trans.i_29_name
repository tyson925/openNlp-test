 
     		
 	
 		okay well
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i don't exercise on a regular basis i think about it a lot
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but i chase an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eighteen month old</TIMEX> and i think if i do much else i'm gonna fall over
 	
 	
 		well isn't that the truth
 	
 	
 		so
 		that's um i like exercising i feel good when i do it
 		but i find it real hard to fit it into a schedule
 	
 	
 		well i just started going back to aerobics
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a week</TIMEX> and
 		it just <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the minute</TIMEX> you get off work you got to run over there change clothes
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		do that come home take a bath you know get cleaned up and there's always <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> at our house
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and things going on and it it's hard it's hard to fit it in and i'm not one of these that loves aerobics anyway
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		no
 	
 	
 		we're going snow skiing in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX> so i'm wanting to get in shape before we went so that i wouldn't just fall over dead
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		up there but i thought as soon as this is over i am quitting
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i just
 	
 	
 		it's not going to last long huh
 	
 	
 		no and i you feel good after you you know you work out but it's always a mental chore for me to get psyched up to go
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but once i get there i'm all right
 	
 	
 		yeah well now i did find uh a video that i really liked and i just can't quite convince myself it's worth paying for yet
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and it was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Simmons Sweating</ENAMEX> to the Oldies
 	
 	
 		oh i know i saw that i want that
 	
 	
 		it's a lot of fun my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> likes it
 	
 	
 		oh you're kidding
 	
 	
 		no my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girlfriend</ENAMEX> and i used to work out to it right before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> and we put him in her playpen at her <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and he thought that was the funniest thing to watch us dancing around because it's more like just dancing
 	
 	
 		
 
 		it is
 	
 	
 		than anything else
 	
 	
 		yeah and the but the fact that all the movements that they do are exactly what you need to but the fact that it's songs that you like and movements that are not so hard
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well that's true and the only other thing about that was that they weren't maybe songs that i was real familiar with
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but i could feel it it it wasn't that you couldn't feel that it was working
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		because i'm out of shape and i could feel it working but i enjoyed what i was doing so much that it was pretty much one of those i didn't care that i was really working out
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that's the only video i have even considered buying
 	
 	
 		well and it's one of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> he has <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Sweating To The Oldies Two and Three</ENAMEX> and i haven't seen the other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> but i really think they'd be a lot of fun to have
 	
 	
 		i think so i think they're around <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">dollars</NUMEX> apiece aren't they yeah
 	
 	
 		yes even at a discount store i've looked at them and they're about <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eighteen ninety</NUMEX> for one of them so uh that's why i say i can't quite
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i can't see paying some <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to enjoy watching me sweat and uh not and not enjoy myself
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i know
 	
 	
 		that was the other thing about working out
 	
 	
 		i have a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> that lives in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> and she <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX> goes to some gym and they work out on all kinds of machines and the whole bit and i just thought you must be kidding
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		um
 	
 	
 		and then they got to a while they'd go before work
 		may be work out for an hour i thought y'all are eaten up with it just  yeah just eaten up with it but they're young and they're single and
 	
 	
 		oh you're kidding
 		you <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are crazy
