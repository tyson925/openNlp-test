 		ah
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh so um
 		i i'm and i'm an absolute nut about <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats um</ENAMEX> i didn't i used to have <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">um</ENAMEX> and uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> have died and those original <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> have died and we've taken these on and uh i i just love them i think they're wonderful what about you
 	
 	
 		we have uh one dog no <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> and one dog so um we
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		what what kind of dog
 	
 	
 		we have a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golden Retriever</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh we that's what we had yeah we loved them yeah
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		yeah she's a mess
 	
 	
 		yeah they uh we had as i say <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> and then uh gave uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>' grandparents <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> and they got another <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> and so i mean there've been <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> sort of in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> around they're sweet dogs
 	
 	
 		wow
 		yeah they i mean they go through a a terror a time
 	
 	
 		yeah how old
 	
 	
 		um she's let's see i guess she's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about eleven</NUMEX> months
 	
 	
 		oh well yes you still you're still at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">puppy</ENAMEX> stage yeah
 	
 	
 		so she's
 		yeah
 		and they say they stay <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">puppies</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of years</TIMEX> so
 	
 	
 		yes you're right
 	
 	
 		um but she you know we took her through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">obedience school</ENAMEX> back when at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four four or five months</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and then we had her fixed at around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven months</TIMEX> because i couldn't handle her
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		being in heat and all that yeah
 	
 	
 		yes i was so worried the whole time that you know a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> was going to jump the fence and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right
 	
 	
 		and we decided that we weren't going to breed her and and stuff because there we felt there were enough <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		right and that's true all ours are fixed too
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		so um we went ahead and had her fixed while she was in heat and um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		but she's she's pretty smart although she you know she gets angry and she's just like a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> when she um
 		oh if she's so into what she's doing
 		you know she won't listen to you listen to a command listen to a command well like um
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		okay i'm trying to think of an example if we're sitting on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couch</ENAMEX> and she wants to play with you and you say no you know off
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and then she'll she'll come and stick one paw up and then you take her paw and set it off well she starts doing it and she gets frustrated that you're telling her no so it turns into this
 		this uh almost a fight you know it's like you can't tell me that you know so she starts losing her patience and then we lose our patience
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		what does she do when she loses her patience
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		i mean does she bite or bark or
 	
 	
 		um no she bites a lot but i mean it's sometimes it's it's not angry but sometimes it is
 	
 	
 		oh that's unusual because they don't usually bite
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah they well she's real mouthy you know and that's one thing i think with being retrievers is um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know everything goes into their mouth and and she just wants attention but she gets angry that you're not giving her the attention
 	
 	
 		right
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and then when you you know like like she goes and steals things um  oh we have to keep the doors to our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedrooms</ENAMEX> closed and she'll go in and if she gets in there she'll go in and pick a teddy bear off this little rocking chair
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		and she'll bring it in and she'll kind of show it to she'll stand there until you see her and then as soon as you see her she takes off and it's like come get me
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh my goodness well ours didn't do that ours were much quieter but i had i did have a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> at the time and so it may be that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> was sort of all this other stuff for them i don't know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i think so and also having other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> or having other animals
 	
 	
 		uh
 		yes
 		we we we have found that with with all of our <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pets</ENAMEX> is that we we've never had just one because we somehow feel like they need another one i don't know if that's a human thought and not an <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> thought or what but
 	
 	
 		no i think it's a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> thought too because they do tend to be pack dogs you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and they because she loves uh we have a neighbor down the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> that has a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> and
 		um we there's lots of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> in our neighborhood but the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> down the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> she just goes crazy over i mean you'd think that that <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elvis</ENAMEX> or something she just goes hog wild over that <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		and um they have a lot of fun together but she doesn't do that with other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> it's just that one one friend
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah well and i i think they they can be territorial so you you know have to maybe some of them they're more comfortable with than others but
 	
 	
 		but we did get her though because we'd heard that they were good with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> so
 	
 	
 		oh they and then they are i mean my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> would just you know and and you've heard the stories i'm sure but you know everything from using his little wooden hammer on her head to all sorts of things and
 		um she would just move over you know i mean and that was that was the worst that ever happened
 	
 	
 		yeah
