 
     		
 	
 		the opportunity to uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		talk with someone with my name
 	
 	
 		no there's really not very many
 	
 	
 		no there really aren't
 	
 	
 		uh when i went to school there was probably three
 		you know in various ages but you don't you don't find that name very often
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh</ENAMEX> that's interesting well are you uh involved in any kind of home repair projects right now
 	
 	
 		uh we just got through having the ceiling in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen</ENAMEX> touched up
 	
 	
 		did y'all have
 	
 	
 		the roof we had a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rain</ENAMEX> and the roof was leaking and it went down and had a big spot on the ceiling
 		and we intended to to fix it ourselves
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and that didn't work so we ended up hiring just uh a handy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> and it turned into a huge project for him
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		and he couldn't he tried to match the spot and he couldn't match it and ended up having to do the whole ceiling over
 	
 	
 		the whole  well we have a spot just like that in our kitchen
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but we haven't uh it's just a stain you know it's not really it's a stain on the paint it's not where <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> actually leaked
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh on the floor i mean it's not like a hole in the ceiling
 		and um i don't know i know there's stuff you can get sealer and stuff that actually has some color to it but we are probably going to have to end up repainting the whole ceiling too
 	
 	
 		yeah i think so but we tried just at first just kind of spackling it it's one of those type ceilings this is an older <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and we were trying to just repair that and match the the uh texture
 	
 	
 		oh
 		uh
 	
 	
 		and we couldn't do that and then
 	
 	
 		uh
 		is it like a is it like a popcorn ceiling or what's the texture
 	
 	
 		it's i'm not even sure what it is it's not like the kind at my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> is a blown texture
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and this is an old older <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and it's kind of a
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sponge</ENAMEX> is what it looks like to me
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		that they took the uh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plaster</ENAMEX> and kind of sponged it
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		but it's a different pattern and he had so much trouble trying to match it
 		and the paint and everything he finally just had to redo the whole ceiling repaint the whole thing
 	
 	
 		well that's probably the easiest thing to do i guess in that case
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		but he uh i was surprised he stuck with the price that he had quoted
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		which was just a couple a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">hundred dollars</NUMEX> to fix the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> place and then he found out that the beam there was not support to attach his stuff to and it turned out to be a mess
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		he finally finally got it finished
 	
 	
 		well
 		and it looks nice
 	
 	
 		it does i was i because it took <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several days</TIMEX> and i work so he was on his own during the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> and then i would just have to come home and call him at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> and say excuse me
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		this doesn't look good
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		because he was going to let it go if i hadn't said anything at first when it didn't match and stuff he was just going to go with that
 		and i am sure nobody would notice if they come in they don't look up immediately but i noticed but when he fixed it
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		but this the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> it belongs to my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father-in-law</ENAMEX> and our deal as far as living here and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each month</TIMEX> we fix something
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and we put a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">deck</ENAMEX> in and we landscaped the yard and we put new carpeting in and we put new linoleum in and then we had the ceiling fixed and put a new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX> in the bathroom
 		and wallpaper but just as soon as you get finished with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> job it's time for another one
 	
 	
 		well we are in the midst of all that now too we've lived in our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> for uh  <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</TIMEX> and uh
 		my <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> it's just uh she's like a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> she wants to play  as soon as you get the phone she my <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> is trying to uh a fifty pound dog is trying to get in my lap uh anyway uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so we really have not done much to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> we kind of worked on the landscaping outside but
 		but <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> we've made uh kind of a list of things we want to do and we devote <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of every <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> to our work projects and then <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one night</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a week</TIMEX> and uh so right now we are painting our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">master</ENAMEX> bedroom
 		actually it's my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> i can't  i am expecting so i am not suppose to be around the paint fumes  so
