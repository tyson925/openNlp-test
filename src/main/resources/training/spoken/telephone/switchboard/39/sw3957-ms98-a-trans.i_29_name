 
     		
 	
 		okay how do you feel about it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well i feel like the major problem we have and the reason that crime has gotten so out of hand is because there isn't a punishment that's matching what's being done
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i agree with that
 	
 	
 		and i think it starts when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> are little i think the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> in our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> teach our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> that as long as they can get away with something that it's all right
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		because i don't see a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> especially where i'm at i have a lot of the responsibility of what ever is done in our neighborhood because there's no other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> at home
 	
 	
 		yes i have the same thing here
 	
 	
 		and i see a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> very small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> coming home to empty <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX> and doing all kinds of unbelievable things and as long as they don't let anybody know about it they get away with it  so
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know i feel like if our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents mothers</ENAMEX> stayed home if we had that secure start you know where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> learned the right way to act um they were rewarded for their good behavior
 		and they had a secure <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> that they came from i think we'd see a whole different society
 	
 	
 		yeah that kind of goes right along with what i'm thinking too is well the movies and the TV the violence and all the
 		things that are on there if the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> were home in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the afternoon</TIMEX> when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> came home maybe they wouldn't be watching as much as this
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		but then again there's some of them at home at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> with them that do not monitor what their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> are watching
 		and so it's i think you're right in that it is <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> caring enough to may be put off having that other <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> or the other TV or what ever it is they're working for
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right
 	
 	
 		and take care of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		well you know i did a survey on why <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> left their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> to go to work  and i found out that more than eighty percent of all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> i talked to
 	
 	
 		um-hum  what'd you find out
 	
 	
 		the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> went to work to provide a better life for their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and when i talked with their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> wanted their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> home rather than the the the material things they were getting
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yes i i can believe that
 	
 	
 		and it's just too bad that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> won't listen to this survey
 		so  i just think that um another problem is i think the way the legal system has been set up that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">criminals</ENAMEX> get out and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">jails</ENAMEX> are so over crowded they can't handle punishing the
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that are committing the bad crimes
 		sufficiently i think they need to put more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> out to death um if it's completely witnessed and it's uh seen that there's no
 		you know i think there needs to be more severe punishment but it needs to be fair
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		right
 		right but and maybe not quite so much publicity either i think there's far too much publicity on some of these violent crimes that and then it seems to become a challenge
 	
 	
 		right i think that
 		to oh out do it
 	
 	
 		to be shown to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to see if they can get away with it
 	
 	
 		yeah or out do what's been done
 	
 	
 		right that it's
 	
 	
 		yeah i think that's another problem um i know that once when i was reading a book when i was studying history
 		and it said you show me a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> that can produce strong <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> and you'll have a strong country
 		and if you look back over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> histories our <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> was strong until the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> started leaving the home
 	
 	
 		um-hum <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>'s rights and all these good things  the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> are the ones who suffer
 	
 	
 		that's right
 		that's right and they do and then they grow up and it just continually will get worse
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yes and and
 	
 	
 		so
 		i guess what we both agree on is that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> need to change their way of thinking
 	
 	
 		right right yes and until the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> change i think that we'll continue to have this problem and it will worsen
 	
 	
 		right and i think <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> need to have some sort of a an idea of why we're here and what we're doing and what we're working towards and why it's important to do these things rather than just getting ahead materialistically
 	
 	
 		yes uh-huh uh back to the old basic morals and
 	
 	
 		that's right  well um do they come do they come on and say when we've talked visited for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five minutes</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		and things that
 		i i don't know i i thought they did but this is my <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time also so well but in
 	
 	
 		this is your <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time
 		um
 		we discussed i discussed on here with someone um <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX> about the justice system and how it could be improved on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">juries</ENAMEX> and we discussed about how half the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jury</ENAMEX> that they select to
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know come up with the verdict if <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of those were law <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> then they could understand what was going on in the court room
 		and have the time that they spent in their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jury</ENAMEX> district count towards some of their graduation hours
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hey</ENAMEX> that would be a good idea  that's
 	
 	
 		wouldn't that be a good idea because i think so sometimes the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">juries</ENAMEX> don't understand all this the legal you know talk and and what's going on
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and this way it would get <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that were a little more knowledgeable <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least half</NUMEX> of them
 		to be on that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> or on the jury
 	
 	
 		that
