 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		all right that's a real different topic i'm not sure i'm familiar with
 		with what they mean of invasion of privacy
 	
 	
 		i know i guess that
 		i guess you consider just things that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX> that would you'd think of about see i'm a college <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> so i can think of lots of things that my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">roommate</ENAMEX> does that bother me
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know that i think's like is an invasion of my privacy stuff like that but i think it'd be it is kind of a tough topic
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i think personally you know i'm i'm i used to be a college student <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten years ago</TIMEX> but  uh now i think an invasion of my privacy is when someone calls me on the telephone
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mrs Miller</ENAMEX> have we got a deal for you
 	
 	
 		oh gosh you're like no you don't no
 	
 	
 		it's like how do you know my name where did you get my phone number and why do you think it's a deal for me
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i mean those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> they'll call you any time of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> with try to solicit and that's an invasion of my privacy i think
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		they call late now i mean now there's i heard that they were going to start calling on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturdays</TIMEX> or something
 	
 	
 		oh they do already
 	
 	
 		see that's ridiculous i would be so mad
 	
 	
 		well and i've even had the computer generated calls on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sundays</TIMEX> too
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		but i do know of a way to get around the computer generated calls
 	
 	
 		
 
 		huh
 	
 	
 		don't answer your phone hello the computer's geared to to start talking to you on the on the word hello
 	
 	
 		
 
 		really huh i don't know i'd think like things that that i think's like privacy is like just like not going through my stuff but like going through just like my clothes or my drawer just going through my stuff basically
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 		oh yeah oh yeah
 	
 	
 		that drives me up a wall
 	
 	
 		are you and your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">roommate</ENAMEX> a similar size
 	
 	
 		no see we're not and uh
 	
 	
 		and she still goes through your clothes
 	
 	
 		yeah she'll take all my shirts and stuff because she can't wear like my pants but she'll take all my shirts and my blouses and stuff
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		ooh
 	
 	
 		man i'm just glad she can't wear my pants or my skirts or my dresses you know
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		but still she'll just take them and she won't even think about it and then i'll like see her <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that day</TIMEX> and she'll be wearing my clothes and i'll be like you know i don't like to borrow my clothes out you know i really don't
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so i prefer that you just not go in and get them because she doesn't even ask me
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		stuff like that really  like that's an invasion of my privacy i feel like
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i agree
 	
 	
 		stuff like that when you have your door closed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> just walking in and stuff like that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i was thinking like my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mom</ENAMEX> i know this she would think this is like an invasion of her privacy is like going through her purse like if you ever needed money and stuff we always just give her her purse you know and she'll get it out or whatever
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i was trying to think i was thinking that's the only thing i could really think of that would really be
 	
 	
 		my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mom</ENAMEX> doesn't even like for us to go through her cabinets
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		i mean we're all grown all her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> are grown and we have our own <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> and now if we go through her cabinets she's like well what are you digging for
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah get out of my cabinets
 	
 	
 		yeah like what are you doing don't you have your own <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> to dig through
 	
 	
 		that's great
 	
 	
 		yeah so
 		i guess that privacy is really
 		and at the work place i suppose oh well actually yes i can say definitely privacy at the work place i hate it for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to open up my drawer to my desk
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		see
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		because that was that was where i kept all my stuff and i could tell i mean even if a pen was turned the wrong way oh yeah
 	
 	
 		you could tell you know you put your stuff where it's yeah
 		that would drive that would that
 	
 	
 		it would drive it drove me batty for a while yeah well i worked <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a second</TIMEX> shift
 	
 	
 		really
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and everybody else in my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">area</ENAMEX> worked first shift and our shifts overlapped
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so i would come in and there would be <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> sitting at my desk working
 		and i'm wondering you know um
 		what is this  it's my vitamins
 		i wonder what is you know yeah what is why are they working at my desk and can i have it back
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		can i have it back soon maybe
 	
 	
 		then you start missing stuff and
 	
 	
 		oh yeah  no mommy is going to take the vitamins
 		i'm sorry i have a small person
 	
 	
 		that's okay
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		see that would that would make me really mad because you can always tell when someone's touched your stuff just because i mean i know i have everything like a certain way
 	
 	
 		
 
 		switchboard call
 	
 	
 		and you know how it looks and everything
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh yeah well you know how you left it <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> before
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		that would bother me definitely
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		so that's
 		
 
 		yeah i agree it's it's pretty tough that way
 		and
 		i know even like with your <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> books and paper
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		do you miss your <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX> sometimes
 	
 	
 		see yeah
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh  huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you just know that's the only thing i can really think about being an invasion of privacy like something <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX> though
 	
 	
 		yeah well actually i do know and i have used it once and it it really is an invasion of privacy but
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> there's a book that you can find out what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>'s phone numbers are by where they live by their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> address yeah
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and that i mean i've i've used it once
