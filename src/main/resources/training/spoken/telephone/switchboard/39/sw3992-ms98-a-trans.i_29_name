 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well the topic is is very apropos to what's going on um how do you feel about our topic
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well i feel like uh i do feel like we pay a lot of taxes i don't mind paying a lot of taxes if the taxes taxes are spent well
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		but uh i'm not convinced that they're being spent well um
 	
 	
 		um i think that's because uh it's like i told someone <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the other day</TIMEX> i'm a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">housewife</ENAMEX> and uh among uh working <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> too and i know how it is to live on a budget and i hear what you're saying
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know our taxes it's nice to see them spent for things that benefit the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX> but when we see them wasted that's when we think we're paying too much
 	
 	
 		well i feel i i mean one of the things is when it's it it's not going it's going into a lot of military stuff which is badly spent
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and not going into a lot of infrastructure things uh or or um you know social needs
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		that that it could i mean when you look at the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pie</ENAMEX> it's uh where our money is spent it's it's uh very very um skewed
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh so i don't feel like i i just don't feel like they're doing what i would do with it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well i think uh in a way that's that's uh almost off our topic in you know in that uh they didn't want us to talk about how it was spent but i don't think you can separate it
 		i know um i felt very fortunate once when i talked with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX> and she said their taxes are at least fifty percent
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh in talking to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> i've met from other places uh we do seem to get off light
 		except you know if you ever make money <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one year</TIMEX> now you pay all this horrible taxes and you don't get to keep any of it
 	
 	
 		well uh but the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who pay a lot of taxes also get a lot of services they have national health
 	
 	
 		that's
 	
 	
 		so you know uh
 	
 	
 		oh yeah um-hum
 	
 	
 		in other words yes that's why i say
 	
 	
 		in the other countries
 	
 	
 		yeah so i'm saying if we did i wouldn't mind paying what we pay
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		or even more if i got a lot of stuff back for it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh
 	
 	
 		well on national health so many of them can't use it they say because they never can get in to see their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		at least in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i we hear that here uh some although we get some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who obviously don't want it like
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		like rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		who who'd rather us not have it i think but i don't know i i just and local taxes um i think are probably
 		just about the same you know the school the school taxes and all of that income of course is not a a topic in in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> yet but i'm sure it's coming
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		i hope it doesn't i uh i hope not but i don't see any way out of it unless we start cutting some spending drastically
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		no
 		that's true i've lived in uh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> where they had income tax and you you know and you just get used to it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh again again um
 		it just depends on what they're what it's being spent on
 	
 	
 		of course i i think the sales tax is about the most equitable tax there is
 		because if you don't uh buy and participate you don't have to have to pay it
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		and uh that way <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who use the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> and live outside of the area basically help pay some of the upkeep for it
 	
 	
 		yeah and sometimes and sometimes i think it does work that way um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but they you know uh
 		uh again it's it's you you you have the different kind of taxes then then then what are they being used for and who is deciding what they are being used for
 	
 	
 		and how much is spent to administrate administrate them
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		all those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are doing those things and and and i know that the stories i mean i personally know <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who have been in this place where you know they they're having trouble paying their taxes and they
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh like you would with a bank you know go into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> and say you know you can you can do all this stuff to me and get nothing or give me you know let me pay this out and you'll get it all
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and they'll say no you know and i think now wait a minute that was my money you said no with well well well you're not going to get it all uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that's right
 		yeah and and one of the things that makes it so hard on these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> they slap so much penalty and interest on it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		that they can triple it in nothing flat
 	
 	
 		yeah i mean it's the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> place that there's no recourse at all
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> aren't trying to get out of it but trying to figure a way to live and pay it back
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and they just they don't accept that at all so
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
