 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh  yeah what what have you thought anything about another another car
 	
 	
 		yes i have a nineteen eighty one
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Volvo</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">station wagon</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over a hundred</NUMEX> and fifty <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">thousand miles</NUMEX> on it
 	
 	
 		it's about time to start thinking isn't it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yes and so uh i've actually been looking around and then then things got too busy and it's too complicated out there so
 	
 	
 		isn't it a pain to look for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> i i hate it i really do as a matter of fact i've got my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> is uh i have a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an eighty seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lincoln</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yes yes
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh i just put it in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX> about oh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks ago</TIMEX>
 		and just spent about twelve <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">hundred dollars</NUMEX> on it i decided to get everything that's wrong with it fixed new brakes new shocks new mufflers and all that because i'm going to keep it till it dies
 	
 	
 		well that that's kind of uh i was the brakes didn't feel like they were working and uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> were saying you know don't you get rid of it <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every three years</TIMEX> and everything and i really was thinking about that then it was like
 		get a loan then you've got to do these you've got to investigate it you've got to check all these things does it have that you you know you can't just go to this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealer</ENAMEX> you really need to check them all and
 		you can't fall in love with one you've got to be able to turn your back on and then by the time everyone had given me their advice i thought you know this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> turns on every <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX>
 		i think i'll just keep going
 	
 	
 		i know it well and the other thing is too uh it it's just i mean
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		the the prices the way the prices have gone up in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past four or five years</TIMEX> is uh it just unbelievable
 	
 	
 		yes yes
 		right no that's right and and uh the only thing i need is uh i'm not really into <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> so i just need something to get me somewhere
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i wanted an air bag i thought that would really be a nice thing to have <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Volvos</ENAMEX> are safe <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> the other thing is i drive all parts of town
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and all of sudden the idea of driving in a newish looking <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> made me much more vulnerable to something happening to it than the car i'm in
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		i understand that i i do i understand that
 	
 	
 		so so so again i think well now wait a minute besides which i get a more expensive i mean a you know a new car i pay more in taxes uh-huh and insurance
 	
 	
 		insurance insurance yeah and
 		right right well i've i really have uh you know like i say i i feel like i have made a commitment now to drive the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> that i've got which you know and and and after i will admit after i had those repairs made on it i felt like you know it felt like it was new again
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		like a good car right
 	
 	
 		yeah and i was very pleased with the money i had put into it which is odd that i ever walk away from spending any money on a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> that i felt good about but in
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		that you felt good about yeah
 	
 	
 		but in this particular instance i did because everything felt like they just tightened everything up somehow but uh  but i had decided kind of you know just without really giving it a whole lot of thought
 	
 	
 		yes yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		that when i do buy again uh i bought this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> that i've got new but probably what i'm going to do sometime in the future is uh i'm going to look around for a good clean used <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> old
 	
 	
 		yes that's exactly what they told me they told me too they said you should get it <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</TIMEX> because i don't know because the price has come down that much in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the two years</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		and and uh <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> number of miles you know or like <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eleven thousand</NUMEX> miles i can't remember i mean <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> had all these formulas i just felt intimidated so intimidated
 	
 	
 		well and let you know on on note i think anyone you talk with is going to have a different viewpoint on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">automobiles</ENAMEX> and really and the other thing is too i i don't think that it what what
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		is true for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> may not necessarily be true for another because other you know so many different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have different needs and and and desires as uh as far as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> are concerned but uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's just the the kind the i know if i go out to buy a new one i mean i know what kind of money it would take to do it and i just don't want to pay that much money
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh</ENAMEX>  and yeah well the that's my feeling too and eventually they'll be coming out with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> that you know have much better gas mileage or use different kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> which is something that matters to me
 		so um if you know if i can keep this one going i mean then uh you know i even considered leasing they talked about leasing i looked into that and then that you know then no it doesn't it makes sense for this kind of thing but not for that
 	
 	
 		yeah i leased <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> car
 	
 	
 		oh you did
 	
 	
 		yeah i did that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time i had a i got an <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eighty five</NUMEX> or rather it was a uh well it actually started to lease <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an eighty four</NUMEX> and it was a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three year</TIMEX> lease
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know the only thing about it is i mean it was simple to get into and it really wasn't bad to get out of
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but you pay that money <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every month</TIMEX> and then you're finished with it and you don't have nothing to show for it granted if you had
 	
 	
 		yes yeah
 		you have nothing left yeah
 	
 	
 		spent that money buying one you still wouldn't have much to show for it  but you would have at least a little
 	
 	
 		right right
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so it's it you know i i think it depends i i i guess there's certain instances that that could be the best thing to do but i don't think i'll go that route again
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> told me if you're the kind who buys a new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every two to four years</TIMEX> that your
