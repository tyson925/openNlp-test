 		i'm <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bridget</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">hi Bridget i'm Gunner</ENAMEX> i'm here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		are you i'm in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lubbock</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh you are oh okay
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i go to school at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tech</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		okay you ready for me to push one
 	
 	
 		yeah sure am
 	
 	
 		okay
 		
 
 		okay
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		so what do you think about the elderly and their health care
 	
 	
 		well  uh i think there uh you know need to have uh some some means of taking care of them in a in a reasonable and uh uh
 		i guess respectful way
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh it's uh
 		i guess my biggest problem is that uh they seem to uh be
 		uh be you know put in nursing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> and just forgotten about that's
 	
 	
 		yeah i think that's really sad
 	
 	
 		you know
 		have you uh ever spent much time or worked around <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or anything
 	
 	
 		yeah i have um my great <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandmother</ENAMEX> was in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> and i used to go visit her a lot i think it's sad because one it's so expensive
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		just to put them in there and it's such a traumatic decision anyway
 		and then it's like no one goes and sees them i think that's really sad i mean that i didn't even think about that what i <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> was thinking about this topic and stuff and that's just that's that's amazes me you know
 	
 	
 		is there uh uh
 		well shoot i guess there's no uh Medicare i don't think pays for it
 	
 	
 		no i don't think so
 	
 	
 		um
 		um i don't know it's just the whole thing is just kind of amazing to me
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but they need someone to take care of them you know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you can kind of see both sides  i mean the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that have to be in one you know should be or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that are just put in one you know that do not need serious you know medical care i think that's kind of sad
 	
 	
 		yeah and a lot of other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> though uh uh you know basically like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> takes them
 	
 	
 		yeah that's uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh i guess take them for as long as they are you know as long as they live
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		should go back to that
 		think more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> should do that
 	
 	
 		well i yeah i do too
 	
 	
 		hard as it may sound or be for some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> it's not really that hard
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		least it would be easier
 	
 	
 		especially now that all the you know everybody is getting older and living longer and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh</ENAMEX> that's true
 	
 	
 		uh
 		you know it's it's
 		there's going to be more and more  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah there's going to be more older people
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		whether they like to admit it or not
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that's true though i didn't think about that either <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> got to think about that
 		and just i just think it's it's kind of sad even knowing if your you know if your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> would even want to go in one or not you know i mean my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> are like no way i know there's no way they would ever want to be put in one
 	
 	
 		um yeah
 	
 	
 		and i know that my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> plan to take care of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> you know if it ever gets to the point where they can't take care of themselves you know they're going to go to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> or whatever to take care of them
 		that's what they have to do because they don't want to just put them in a nursing home
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		they don't think that's right
 	
 	
 		um yeah that is uh that's difficult i tell you
 	
 	
 		i guess it would depend on a lot of things like like financial especially
 		and depending on how old they are and how you know i can see if like my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandmother</ENAMEX> whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> used to be in a nursing home she used to go up there and see her <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX>
 		whose my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">great-grandmother</ENAMEX> was in one she used to go see her <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX> and that is great but when she got sick then you know she can't go see her and stuff and you can't expect so i guess it would depend on how old they were too
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		because if if the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> if the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> were too old to take care of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> then
 		i don't think that would be very good either
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		hm
 	
 	
 		pretty touchy topic
 	
 	
 		yeah it sure is i know like uh uh lot of places it's like <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">hundred dollars</NUMEX> a day
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		at least
 	
 	
 		you know
 	
 	
 		they're pretty expensive
 	
 	
 		i know but uh
 	
 	
 		but <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> always figure it as if they had a live in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurse</ENAMEX> too that's you know just as expensive
 	
 	
 		is it i don't even know
 	
 	
 		it is because i know when my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandmother</ENAMEX> was looking to put her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> in
 		that is a big ordeal she's like well it's just expensive to have a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurse</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty four hours</TIMEX> a day than it is to put her in a a place where at least there's other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i mean and she went and saw her <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX> like i said and that's good i think because i don't think if you just put them in there and forget about them i don't think that's right
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah really
 	
 	
 		think that's sad
