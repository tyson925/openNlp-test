 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		so you uh exercise on a regular basis
 	
 	
 		i don't Vinny i'm a a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CPA</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this time of year</TIMEX> i'm dang busy but uh i do do a lot of exercise in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the spring</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> and in the fall
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh what kind of exercise do you do
 	
 	
 		well i don't i don't go to a health <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">club</ENAMEX> and work out and things of that nature but i i run a lot
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i usually try to get uh oh <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about three mornings</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three mornings</TIMEX> a week where i run <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">two miles</NUMEX> a day
 	
 	
 		oh that's not bad um-hum
 	
 	
 		yeah how about yourself
 	
 	
 		well i uh i like to run but uh i have problems with my back hurting so uh i run i if i run it's usually short durations and i only do it when i can't you know get out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		there you know to go because i usually work out in a health <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">club</ENAMEX> and uh i try to work out like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every other day</TIMEX> and sometimes when it's like a really nice day outside i don't feel like going inside to work out then i go ahead and run for short duration
 	
 	
 		yes um-hum
 		um-hum uh do you uh pump iron or what kind of uh
 	
 	
 		yeah i use i like to do uh free weights
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		because uh i found certain parts of my body developed better than other parts of my body so uh instead of they you know they have like different circuits and they tell you to work every single muscle in your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> and uh i hate working a muscle that you know just won't develop
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so uh i've i've gotten uh i've adapted to uh a routine and i like to work my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX> and my chest and my stomach and everything else just seems to stay the same no matter what i do to it
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		so those are what i like to work out the most and you know i get a pretty decent workout with my legs um just you know on occasion running but or you know just running around what i do everyday so
 	
 	
 		uh what
 		i i've never been around weights much is how how's a dead weight help you versus the machine type
 	
 	
 		well sometimes what happens is sometimes uh now different machines i guess uh work different ways but uh the way i look at it if sometimes the machine like you know one hand can put more porce can put more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> than the other one
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so sometimes you end up working out one hand more than the other or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> leg more than the other because the machine averages the weights out
 	
 	
 		oh
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		because you're pulling like the same set of weights out now they they have different machines that will uh
 	
 	
 		right uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		equalize that or
 	
 	
 		right they have what they have like a uh weight weight for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> side and a weight for the other side and that's you know better than uh than like a universal set usually has like <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> set of weights that you know you do for both of them
 	
 	
 		right
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um
 		but even then uh i i'd like to think the free weights simulate a live a real world situation better
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know like uh just like a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> of mine used to tell me he goes uh if you work out with free weights you know and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> falls on you think the free weights going to give you better uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		better idea of what's going to happen rather than if you work out with uh you know with some kind of machine
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but uh the machines the one thing the machines do do that the free weights don't do is they focus on a specific muscle or muscle group
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">huh-uh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		which is something i don't think you will get out of the free weights because the free weights just kind of work your whole body i guess or a whole area as opposed to like one spot because if you get like a particular <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Nautilus</ENAMEX> machine or something
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yes
 	
 	
 		yeah you can get it like down to you know the very last muscle down there
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		so it works pretty good
 	
 	
 		what do you uh do you work your cardiovascular system at all other than the running how do you
 		you know get your
 	
 	
 		um that
 	
 	
 		heart rate up for a while
 	
 	
 		i'm sorry say that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> more time
 	
 	
 		i was just wondering how you get your heart rate up or does pumping iron do that
 	
 	
 		oh no usually what i do is when i get to the uh i i usually like run around the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">track</ENAMEX> they have a track there
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		okay
 	
 	
 		i run around the track uh you know uh maybe like it's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a tenth</NUMEX> of a mile all the way around so i just run real slow you know maybe do a couple of laps just enough to get my heart rate going
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh after that then i just go ahead and just get in my routine i do uh i do my um my sit ups first
 		and that also uh that gets my heart rate going too and then i i don't pump iron until maybe like halfway through and then i sit down and start doing the the free weights
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and then i usually run before i leave to kind of relax me a little bit
 	
 	
 		that's incredible
 	
 	
 		yeah so it it works out okay i haven't uh i the problem is you know i get into it and i work out for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three months four months in a row</TIMEX> get in great shape and then you know i'll have a business conference i usually go overseas <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twice or three</NUMEX> times a year
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yes
 	
 	
 		and to attend these conferences and they kill me  you you travel you eat a lot you um  it messes up you know your uh biological clock you know
 	
 	
 		huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh it just screws you up completely  and by the time you come back you don't feel like working out you know
 	
 	
 		huh do
 		do do do your muscles uh do do you lose the tone fast do you lose the strength in them fairly quickly or
 	
 	
 		well uh
 		i you you don't lose strength i don't think you lose a little bit of tone
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um but you get back into it and you know it doesn't take very long to build it back up
 		but uh i don't think you know they say you get flabby if you you know the more you work out and you get all big muscles and stuff and then also when you stop they say you get flabby when you get older you know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		well it may happen but like i said it's easy to develop them because if i lose if i lose tone you know by not working out uh over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a period of a week</TIMEX> or two
