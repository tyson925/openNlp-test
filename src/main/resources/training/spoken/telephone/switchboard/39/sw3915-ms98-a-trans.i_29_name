 		uh thing with them you know setting in in foreign places or and they're they always have kind of a twist to them
 	
 	
 		i've read i've read a few of hers i was just thinking i i just read a trilogy of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mary Higgins Clark</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh yeah um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh that's so that's why i got confused but
 	
 	
 		yeah those are good too
 	
 	
 		and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		and then i got uh
 		some of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Robert Ludlum</ENAMEX>'s i like those too do you like him
 	
 	
 		i've read all of his
 	
 	
 		yeah i get the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Bourne Supreme the Bourne</ENAMEX> ones i get them all mixed up
 	
 	
 		i can't oh it's been so long since i've read them but i will buy those in hardback
 	
 	
 		yeah i have a lot of those in hardback too
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> and did you read <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fried Green Tomatoes</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		no is it a good book
 	
 	
 		oh it's wonderful
 	
 	
 		where did you get it
 	
 	
 		well my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> gave it to me uh quite a while ago to read
 		and uh then uh uh i guess what brought it to mind uh was that uh last time i went to see the movie
 		
 
 		and uh it did not disappoint me and it's it's just so well written of course <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fanny Flag</ENAMEX> wrote it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh it's uh it's got humor in it and a little bit of suspense suspense
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh uh and you'll cry
 	
 	
 		so well i loved <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Steel Magnolias</ENAMEX> i heard it was similar to that
 	
 	
 		well i think i didn't read <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Steel Magnolias</ENAMEX> but i think it's probably better than <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Steel Magnolias</ENAMEX> were
 		the movie is anyway and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Steel Magnolias</ENAMEX> was tremendous
 	
 	
 		yeah that's one of my favorites
 	
 	
 		but uh this one it just uh sort of has a well my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> enjoyed it i i just kind of mixed you know mixed feelings i didn't know whether he would it might be a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>'s movie
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but uh he just he just raved about the actresses in it that they were so good and everything was real and
 		it was just really good and the reason my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> gave it to me is because my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> is in a nursing home
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i think that uh she was trying to give me something to kind of make me get a message of some kind
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh it was good
 	
 	
 		i might go get it because i i'm reading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX> right now and i'm going to be finished in a minute and and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bookstop</ENAMEX> stays open till <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eleven</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		um-hum well i would highly recommended it and don't get discouraged in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first few</TIMEX> chapters
 	
 	
 		oh i i don't do that i read those i read pretty quickly
 	
 	
 		because
 		well you may have to go i do to and i had to go back and reread
 		because you have to get the they're telling <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> stories at once
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and you have to get it straight and get the names straight
 		that's the thing get all the names straight
 	
 	
 		that could be difficult but uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh where you you're working with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> stories and once you get that down it flows and you can't wait to get to the next part
 		it uh it's one of those that you get caught up in
 	
 	
 		i read uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prince</ENAMEX> of Tides i haven't seen that movie yet
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh
