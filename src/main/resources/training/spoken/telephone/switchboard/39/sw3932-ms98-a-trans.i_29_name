 
     		
 	
 		all right
 	
 	
 		
 
 		it's going to be a hard one huh why
 	
 	
 		yeah i think so i i don't know well i'm not one in finances <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of all and but i do try try to keep a family budget what about you
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		um you know it's it's
 		it's a it is a hard one because we don't have a budget  we barely have enough to cover what we have let alone keep a budget
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well that's the way with us that's why i said i try to keep <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> with my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> isn't working and uh yeah and and it makes it real tough you're right
 	
 	
 		oh is that right that makes it real tough
 		huh so how do you how do you make ends meet and how do you make sure that your bills are paid and
 	
 	
 		well i rob <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter</ENAMEX> to pay <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul</ENAMEX> i pay the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utilities</ENAMEX> and the most expensive uh biggest bills at the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of the month
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and then i look buy the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">groceries</ENAMEX> and the smaller bills like like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">middle of the month</TIMEX> but i have it exed out to last me for the whole month
 		and he works contract work occasionally so that helps he's an electronics engineer an electronics engineer
 	
 	
 		huh
 		what does he do
 		a what
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh he works mainly on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> and he was working with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eastern</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eastern</ENAMEX> uh went bankrupt
 	
 	
 		oh is that right
 	
 	
 		so yeah so um
 	
 	
 		well that's tough yeah especially <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these days</TIMEX> when uh the economy is so bad yeah i work on commission and um
 	
 	
 		he he he he said he
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and that makes it tough too because i you know you can't you can't always budget what you you know you can't have the same budget <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every month</TIMEX> because uh you know uh
 	
 	
 		that's true
 		what kind of work do you do
 	
 	
 		uh i am in the roofing business commercial roofing business
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and so you know i may do real well <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this month</TIMEX> but uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next month</TIMEX> it may you know may not rain at all and we not have any work so
 	
 	
 		that makes it really hard too
 	
 	
 		it makes it really hard to to set any budget and uh you know
 		so um i guess it's uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it you know each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> has their own own way of doing it i i do it about the same way you do you know we pay what what needs to be paid
 		so that we don't you know we don't have the lights turned off or have the electric water turned off or the phone turned off
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		do you ever try to hit a long shot like in lottery or races or anything like that
 	
 	
 		and
 		no i don't um  mostly mostly mostly mostly because we don't uh yeah so how about you
 	
 	
 		have it to do it right hm yeah
 		no i'm the same way i saw where um <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Castleberry</ENAMEX> won i was in that uh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Publisher</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Publisher</ENAMEX>'s Warehouse i never send those either but i thought well maybe you do have a chance after all
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but um
 	
 	
 		huh no i uh you know  most of the uh most of the financial uh
 		problems that we have you know are are things that we kind of brought on ourselves because we kind of overextended ourselves of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> of you know <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">few years ago</TIMEX> with uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		credit cards and stuff and then the economy went bad and you know i was out of work for a couple you know for little while
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		and uh you know been on commissions for for you know <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">few years</TIMEX> and it's just um
 		we just never got caught up so do you own your own home
 	
 	
 		yes we do
 	
 	
 		yeah well we do too and that makes it even tougher because you know we tried to put our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> up for sale and
 	
 	
 		yes
 		harder
 	
 	
 		and uh the economy's so bad we couldn't sell it
 	
 	
 		yeah well when we bought the economy the uh real estate was really high and now with the last appraisal we got and everything it really went down so that if if we would've tried to go on a market we'd have lost money
 	
 	
 		yeah well we did too
 		yeah well we got we you know all we asked out of our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> was the the note
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and um shoot uh somebody came and and offered us we would've lost <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">thousand dollars</NUMEX> on our home
 		you know if we were just to sell it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh so we decided to keep it and kind of just
 		uh
 	
 	
 		i'm trying to hang in there
 	
 	
 		yeah try to make things uh work
 	
 	
 		does your where does your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> work
 	
 	
 		she doesn't i mean she does actually she does she actually probably works more than i do but she does sewing and hair and stuff at home
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and um so the only you know i guess bright uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh thing that we have to look forward to is that i own part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> that that uh i work for and and so that's kind of helping us out you know it's making things a little more um
 		
 
 		little easier because i can always count on a check on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		do you just go commercial
