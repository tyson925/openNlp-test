 		are you
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		okay well this is kind of a hard topic because i don't work
 	
 	
 		you don't
 	
 	
 		no i'm in college so
 	
 	
 		oh so you can dress carefree right
 	
 	
 		but i think
 		that's right i have on a sweat shirt <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">right now and</TIMEX> and jeans  and i feel great
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		what is your best mode of clothing
 	
 	
 		pardon
 	
 	
 		what is your best mode of clothing you like blue jeans best
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		but i think if i was going to go to work and stuff i think a dress or more like a suit would would be more appropriate for sure
 	
 	
 		yes that's what i wear mainly is suits <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">cotton</ENAMEX> or um gabardine
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		wool  sometimes in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> but here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> you don't really need <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wool</ENAMEX> that often
 	
 	
 		yeah doesn't get that hot
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		i don't know i can't i would i wouldn't like to have to wear a suit <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX> though i wouldn't like that at all
 	
 	
 		no i don't do it every day
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		just occasionally do you have a certain fabric you like better than others
 	
 	
 		um
 		with dress clothes
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i honestly i don't know because
 		i haven't had to wear that many dress clothes yet to be honest you know
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i really don't think i i don't even i couldn't even tell you
 		but i would say i don't know
 	
 	
 		well i like cotton the best it's easier to take care of and it's it's uh a much fresher freer and freer fabric
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true anything you don't have to iron that you can just send to the cleaners sounds great
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well cotton you have to iron unfortunately or send to the cleaners but there's some fabrics like you said that uh gabardines and suedes and that that have to go to the cleaners all the time
 	
 	
 		really do you wear really dressy dresses to work
 	
 	
 		yes
 		yes yes i'm up in corporate
 	
 	
 		do you oh okay so you go all out and everything
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		yeah well that would be important though i mean you would have to
 	
 	
 		yes because the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> they see is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX> before the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boss</ENAMEX> and uh i couldn't uh get away with blue jeans and a T-shirt
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i bet you couldn't
 		
 
 	
 	
 		do you wear sneakers do you wear um
 		brand names or do you just get something off the shelf at the stores
 	
 	
 		um i usually get like i usually get <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nike</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		with shoes and stuff like that
 		i'm real big my feet get real sore real easily so i have to have really well padded shoes
 	
 	
 		i see do you like sweaters
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah i love sweaters
 	
 	
 		do you wear them often
 	
 	
 		yeah because it gets really cold up here i mean you get the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">turtle</ENAMEX> neck sweater jacket thing a lot
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		so i mean i would say mostly like now it's like you could wear like a T-shirt or sweat shirt because it's usually chilly in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX> but it's it's warmer at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the winter</TIMEX> you have to bundle up because it gets really cold
 		it's a lot different because i i'm from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh are you
 	
 	
 		yeah i think it's a lot colder than it does in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> that's for sure with all the snow and everything
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that was my next question is to how you where you used to live and how you dressed in comparison to where you were before
 	
 	
 		yeah because i because i am from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> and i live in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Richardson</ENAMEX> so
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i mean it gets cold there but it's not cold like it gets here and i think here it gets <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cold</ENAMEX> and it gets windy you have a you know wind chill at <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">twenty miles an hour</NUMEX> and it gets like bitter cold
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and you have to walk across <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">campus</ENAMEX> and stuff so you really wear a lot of clothes i mean everybody has on like gloves and scarves and ear muffs and everything
 	
 	
 		are you into hats
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh yeah</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		do you wear hats and for dress up too or just
 		in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		um
 		hum i have like <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> and i wear it when i dress up
 		but otherwise i don't have that many though i don't think about it i'm not real good at picking out clothes like if someone were to buy me an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outfit</ENAMEX> and put out with it i would wear it all the time but as far as me picking out clothes myself oh it's not very good
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 		hum in your new uh career after college you going to need clothes a lot
 	
 	
 		yeah i probably will go to graduate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> because i want to be a marriage counselor
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but i'll still need nice clothes you know whatever i do if i do that or if i go into business then i'll still need dress clothes like nice dresses and nice suits and stuff like that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		that's what i plan on waning wearing to work when i go to work
 		to the
 	
 	
 		do you like clothes for uh different <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seasons</TIMEX> or do you like just to wear the basically the same type of thing and just add or take away from it
 	
 	
 		um
