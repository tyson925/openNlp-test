 
     		
 	
 		you go ahead and tell me about your last home repair
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well let's see my last home repair i put an office in my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garage</ENAMEX> i uh took down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of my uh uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> car <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garage</ENAMEX> doors and i uh
 		i made an office out of it and uh  the funny thing was
 		um it i  i didn't think i needed a permit
 		you know because i wasn't yeah i wasn't changing the the looks of the of the outside
 	
 	
 		a building permit yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX> called the uh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> on me  yeah  he turned me in  and i i was halfway done with the office
 	
 	
 		oh he turned you in  huh
 		huh
 	
 	
 		and uh so oh well what they did was i i called i'm a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">contractor</ENAMEX> myself and i'm i'm a roof <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">contractor</ENAMEX> so
 	
 	
 		did they fine you or what uh
 		okay
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh i went down and got some permits from some uh roof work that we were doing
 		and i uh i talked to them about my you know my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garage</ENAMEX>
 		and uh so they said well you need to get a permit for this and that and you know electrical and all that kind of stuff so they here's the funny thing they said they uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 	
 	
 		they wouldn't give me the permit because they needed a uh pre inspection
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay so they came to do the pre inspection and they they didn't pass it because i didn't have a permit on site
 	
 	
 		yeah uh-huh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		oh you're kidding
 		
 
 		so how'd you finally get a permit
 	
 	
 		oh we're  i'm still in my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> and they i still don't have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> and no  huh
 	
 	
 		you're kidding did you finish it
 		did you finish it
 	
 	
 		uh yeah  yeah
 	
 	
 		and without a permit
 		yeah that that that is funny
 	
 	
 		so it's it's quite comical in fact um i'm starting in my i i'm actually not starting my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bathroom</ENAMEX> but i couldn't help but start at my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bathrooms</ENAMEX> i uh taking a shower <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX> i i uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		put my hand on the on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the tile walls to support myself
 		and put my hand right through
 	
 	
 		huh you've got to get a permit even to like remodel a bathroom
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well um yeah i think i yeah yeah here in in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Plano</ENAMEX> that's uh yeah
 	
 	
 		is that right
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">jimminy Christmas</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it's pretty strange
 	
 	
 		hum i didn't realize they were that stringent i uh have done a little bit of remodeling on my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> i'm i'm an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">accountant</ENAMEX> but i sure enjoy um
 		you know messed around and doing some things and i finished <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a couple</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">basement</ENAMEX> and i built a real nice storage shed on a concrete foundation and and uh i've never got a building permit yeah in fact i
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		is that right well here yeah even even uh even just putting uh little uh uh patio outside you have to have a permit
 	
 	
 		i know
 		
 
 		huh
 	
 	
 		yeah it's it's pretty strange
 	
 	
 		i'm thinking about building a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> on my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and i you know i haven't thought twice about getting a permit
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah you have uh i i think things you know are are different from city to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> or from state to state but
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		well i'm not sure i think i'm supposed to have one i just never have gotten one
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		maybe my neighbor'll turn me in too
 	
 	
 		yeah  well i i think my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX> was a little bit uh put out because he came over to you know he he asked to to help me
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and he's pretty busy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> i thought anyway and i said well i've i've got my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> from work they're gonna to come over and do most of the work you know i said i appreciate your your asking but
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it was funny because  right the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">just the day</TIMEX> after he called
 	
 	
 		is that right huh
 	
 	
 		yeah you know i i guess i should have let him come over and
 	
 	
 		i
 	
 	
 		and did my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garage</ENAMEX> i mean i wouldn't have mind but i you know i thought he was he was pretty busy and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		wouldn't have time to do it
 		but that's how things are
 	
 	
 		well that's interesting well i know you don't have any good horror stories about home repair then because you probably uh don't have any problem if you're in the profession
 	
 	
 		no actually um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		do you install metal roofs
 	
 	
 		we do um yeah well we we don't install we we do mostly repairs we do some uh reroofing with built up roofs
 	
 	
 		or
 		or just the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">asphalt</ENAMEX> type shingle
 	
 	
 		and uh but we do repair uh metal roofs
 	
 	
 		uh-huh but but like if you were doing a residential if somebody a residential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX> wanted you to come in and reroof their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> but you do that kind of stuff uh-huh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		we do that yeah
 		uh we do work we do mostly commercial stuff uh and we do work on a lot of metal roofs but we we don't install them we just uh uh repair them
 	
 	
 		uh what's your opinion about those i'm my my <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">home</ENAMEX>'s gonna need to be either reshingled or reroofed in the near future we don't have a lot of heavy snow right here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Twin Falls</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but uh i was looking towards getting a whole <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aluminum</ENAMEX> you know or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">metal</ENAMEX> or whatever is
 	
 	
 		uh i'd be real careful extreme temperature changes uh affect the metal roofs
 	
 	
 		in in what way
 	
 	
 		it it expands and retracts and um
 		just
 	
 	
 		hum more so than the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">asphalt</ENAMEX> shingles
 	
 	
 		yeah
