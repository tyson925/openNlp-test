 
     		
 	
 		and
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		have you lived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Garland</ENAMEX> long
 	
 	
 		um yeah we're going <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about six years</TIMEX> yeah
 	
 	
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about six years</TIMEX> tell me your name again i'm sorry <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Carol</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">okay um</ENAMEX> are you in a new area or old
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carol um</ENAMEX>-hum
 		um  well it's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about six years old</TIMEX> we've lived here as long as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX> has been built so i guess it is
 		new in some way although we're learning it's falling apart
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		no that's exaggeration but we had some problems <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> so
 	
 	
 		oh no leakage or
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um some plumbing problems
 	
 	
 		oh not
 	
 	
 		so and it damaged the carpet and we're going to have to do something we're not sure call insurance or something so
 	
 	
 		i'm not sure what to do
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> is about um twelve years old i guess we've been in it for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about two years</TIMEX> and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i guess there's advantages advantages and disadvantages to moving into a new or old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> um
 		one thing it had all of the window treatments you know so we didn't have to redo that and it had been updated but
 	
 	
 		right
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		their roof is old was old so uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> we covered the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wood</ENAMEX> shingles with uh that composition
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and that was cost a fortune  and uh
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		now we're we're in the process of uh repainting the interior because we didn't paint when we first moved in
 		and uh you know when you shop for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> you don't notice all the little things you think oh this is beautiful and everything and then you find  out that it's
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh i wouldn't think about the painting
 	
 	
 		you know that it's not as great well there's just a lot of uh i mean it has
 		that well the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> before us raised <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> and and so there's just wear wear and tear on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> but you don't notice
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		until you live in it and have to clean it  and you know you you find scratch marks on the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wood</ENAMEX> or
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know places were the dog chewed or i don't know things like that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah because we're kind of thinking of uh trying to find a used home and uh the ones we've looked at have been really nice
 		um but you know there's some things you don't really think about looking at in a pre owned <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> that that you do in a new home so
 	
 	
 		i would say uh you know that uh
 		who is it the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inspector</ENAMEX> you know that you use just um they have a list of things they go over but
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know i think we had maybe a list on top of that that some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> had of ours had told us to go through
 		and just things that they might not normally look for and and go around with them and even if you're kind of on their you know looking over their shoulder or whatever um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		because there's lots of things that furniture hides and you know we have a place we have picture frame paneling in our living room and
 		it is in beautiful condition it's uh it's a custom <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> but there's just areas that they skimped on and uh but the
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		the uh picture frame paneling for the most part is beautiful and and they had this big arrangement on the mantel
 		and it and i think one thing about the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> that made us fall in love with it was
 		their decorating you know their furniture  once you move in your furniture into the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> it's kind of it doesn't have quite the same look but um
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		
 
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		because we're um you know we haven't been married we've been married for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">almost four years</TIMEX> and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh  anyway
 		but there's a piece of paneling behind that's above the mantel that has
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um it's right above the fireplace and i think they there must have been some water running down the chimney behind there because there is some water damage and it's warped and with it being picture frame i don't know how to
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		how to replace that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> piece without having to tear it all down because it's one of the inset <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pieces</ENAMEX> so there's a lot of things to you know to look for and um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		uh yeah
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but i guess new <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> are like that to they probably have things that are constantly
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		needing fixed or at least you probably have to i don't know did did you all did the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">builder</ENAMEX> provide the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mini blinds</ENAMEX> and stuff like that or did you all yeah you had to go purchase all that
 	
 	
 		oh no no huh-uh yeah yeah from scratch everything but we're trying to look for a bigger home <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">right now and</TIMEX> and
 	
 	
 		what size what size <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> are you in now
 	
 	
 		right now we're in <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">um seventeen hundred square feet</NUMEX> so it's were looking for something a lot bigger because we have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh but i like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Garland</ENAMEX> i love <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Garland</ENAMEX> i really really want to stay in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Garland</ENAMEX> if i can but
 		uh you know there's there's other places too like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sachse</ENAMEX> and that and that area place area out there  which is really nice i've been to some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> out there and there's just  uh there there's some really nice <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> out there
 	
 	
 		i'm not really familiar with the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Garland</ENAMEX> i guess i know
 		um i tried
