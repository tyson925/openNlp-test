 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		okay yeah the topic is uh car repairs and the last <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> i've had done it was a fluke the last <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> i had done
 	
 	
 		right
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		what happened
 	
 	
 		well i was driving down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty five</TIMEX> at the um coming from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Dallas</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i was uh going um almost hitting the um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		entry where all the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the merges</TIMEX> go from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six thirty five seventy five</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coit</ENAMEX> and uh all of a sudden i get this liquid all over my hood and my windshield
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i had smelled it before i thought and i thought
 		that it was coming from another vehicle
 		and then when i saw it go all over my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> i thought oh oh something
 		came through my radiator and just
 		something's wrong inside my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> so i i was waiting for my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> to collapse you know i go i was going <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about sixty five miles an hour</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and it kept going and i thought well what is going on
 		and so i made it home and i looked at my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> and it was a mess
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so i immediately <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the next morning</TIMEX> i took it to my dealer
 		and i i left it just how i drove it in the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the night</TIMEX> before and he says well it looks like your uh antifreeze
 		uh something happened to your antifreeze
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		and they checked everything in that car and it wasn't from my car
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it was from some other car some other <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> did that to me well i'm glad but it was a very panicky situation
 	
 	
 		some other <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> had too
 		well isn't that something well oh sure
 		right
 	
 	
 		but no i do not do any of my own repairs the only thing i do to my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> is put <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> in it and wash it
 	
 	
 		well i do i do some of my own repairs yes i do i i have learned to do this
 	
 	
 		oh you do well good for you
 		that's great
 	
 	
 		that uh my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> drives uh sports <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> races he races them as a hobby
 	
 	
 		oh i see oh well he probably showed you all the tricks of the trade that's great
 	
 	
 		yes and he said you need to know how to do all this stuff so i do change my own oil um
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		most in fact i have changed out a whole engine in uh one of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sons</ENAMEX>' trucks
 	
 	
 		you did well bless your heart
 	
 	
 		yes i took the whole thing out and i fixed it but i think it's really important to know these things if you can
 	
 	
 		well i think that's wonderful i mean  i think that's great
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		but now if i could talk him into doing this i'll let him do it i've told him i've learned how but
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well gee you should uh you know you should get some money for your talents and start branching out
 	
 	
 		
 
 		no i don't think i wanna work on too many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> that's hard work i think they earn their money i do
 	
 	
 		it is
 		oh well you know uh loosening those nuts and bolts would be a problem for me
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and i know they have some really sophisticated equipment <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> where they do it electronically and all that but that takes money to buy those kind of tools too
 	
 	
 		yes it does now i i don't think i will be able to work on you know too many <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> much longer because they are sophisticated and i just can't fool with these computers and things that they have in it that

 		well right they can do that with the new ones uh-huh with these newer <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> you can do that and uh
