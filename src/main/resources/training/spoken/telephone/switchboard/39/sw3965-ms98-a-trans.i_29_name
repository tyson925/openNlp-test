 		well i'm not the one that cuts them out my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> cuts them out but um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		he likes using the little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">band</ENAMEX> saws and jig saws more than the stroll saw because the stroll saw is
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		is a lot slower
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and then um he's got a router but now he wants a plunge router
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 		but anyhow he cuts them out and then i i took a tole painting class
 	
 	
 		oh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		to learn how to paint them right you know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and what we wanna do is you know make them and then maybe take them to these <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">craft</ENAMEX> shows or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">flea</ENAMEX> market things and see and see if we can sell some of them
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yes
 	
 	
 		but uh i really like it so far
 	
 	
 		oh that is fun
 	
 	
 		and then my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX> had a little doll made out of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wood</ENAMEX> so i took a pattern off of that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and then it's just a wooden doll with a painted face and then you you make the dress for it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and you drill holes around the top of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> and you you stick in uh like rope
 	
 	
 		oh
 		uh-huh the twine
 	
 	
 		and tie ribbons around it it looked really cute you know so i've got a couple of those started
 	
 	
 		yeah those are so cute

 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i just got back from that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> so if you could get your projects into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boutiques</ENAMEX> oh they are wonderful
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you could make a lot of money from those
 	
 	
 		what do you do i wonder how you you just they buy them from you or you just give them to them on consignment or something
 	
 	
 		uh apparently with that boutique um they take oh what was it
 		<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">twenty percent</NUMEX> of the sell price you would put your sell price
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> and then they would take <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">twenty percent</NUMEX> off of that
 	
 	
 		um i see
 	
 	
 		at the counter and so and then at the end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">boutique</ENAMEX> which usually runs for a week
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		then they give you what you earned
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so you have to decide what your price is going to be and then
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		up it <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">twenty percent</NUMEX> so you can get  what you need out of it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
