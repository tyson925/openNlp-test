 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		alright
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		okay um so what kind of uh uh piece of property have you got
 	
 	
 		we've got a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> and uh very large front and back yard we had a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> grass what they call <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas Dallas</ENAMEX> grass
 		and others  parts of country call <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">Crab grass</ENAMEX> that real <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">thick grass</ENAMEX> and we had a problem with that but we've seemed to've taken care of it how about you
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		well um i um
 		up here we don't have too much trouble with <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">Crab grass</ENAMEX> or anything like that um
 		uh we've uh like we rent the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> that we live in but we've got a pretty large piece of uh land that we live on even though very close into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DC</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and so most of the work that we have to do involves mowing the lawn and um uh uh my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sweetheart</ENAMEX> who i live with uh does a lot of uh flower gardening and stuff around the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> she gets a lot of pleasure from that
 	
 	
 		what <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> does she like
 	
 	
 		hm um well it changes from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year to year</TIMEX> and she's thinking <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> she's gonna get into bulbs and that sort of thing but most of the sorts of things that she
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">uh</ENAMEX> has grown in the past have been um
 		i guess wild <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> and uh some stuff that our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> sort of brings over periodically she's also she likes things like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hollyhocks</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh Peonies and</ENAMEX> and uh
 		oh let's what else has she got oh the other things she's really into is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morning Glories</ENAMEX> and uh in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX> time we have <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morning Glories</ENAMEX> just all over the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> it's great all different colors
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah they climb too
 	
 	
 		yeah it's it's a lot of fun it's real pleasant in fact our next door <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas time this year</TIMEX> couldn't resist giving us a set of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coffee</ENAMEX> cups had <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morning Glories</ENAMEX> all over them
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and uh she she found them and she said oh i just had to buy them for you but uh we're also really into vegetable gardening
 	
 	
 		do you have a problem with any type of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">uh insects</ENAMEX> or gophers or anything
 	
 	
 		
 
 		actually yeah actually we do we we don't have any um any uh you know varmints or anything like that
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		that that tend to bother the garden but we do have a lot of trouble with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX> particularly caterpillars um we've had very very poor luck with uh all of the core <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crops</ENAMEX> and like um uh
 		and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">cabbage and</ENAMEX> and uh broccoli and  cauliflower and that sort of
 	
 	
 		if you uh sprinkle lime on your young <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> before they get too big that should help that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		well that's um exactly what we've done and you're you're advice is is dead on in in our experience in fact uh thing that we've found works even better than lime is diatomaceous earth
 	
 	
 		yeah that works that's kind of hard to get a hold of sometimes
 	
 	
 		uh
 		yeah well um
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackie</ENAMEX> got a hold of a huge box of it so much of it that i dare say that we'll probably still using be using it <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five years from now</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		she went out to some uh pool supply place and and got this huge box of it and it's really it's big
 		and she came home with it and she was real proud and she said okay well we've got a lifetime supply now so we've got no excuse and uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		what <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetables</ENAMEX> do you grow the most
 	
 	
 		well we uh have uh i guess in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last two or three years</TIMEX> really discovered that we're really fond of hot peppers and so um
 		we grow <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tomatoes</ENAMEX> down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> where we get a lot of sun and then in our regular garden plot <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this past uh couple of years</TIMEX> we've grown a lot of different varieties of hot peppers
 	
 	
 		
 
 		do you have jalapenos
 	
 	
 		uh yes which of course are our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">favorites</ENAMEX> and uh but we've also grown a lot of real um uh hot uh smaller varieties like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tais</ENAMEX> and um
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		do you have the small red ones cayenne
 	
 	
 		uh
 		yeah yeah the cayennes and we've even grown some little funny uh uh peppers and i've never i've never been sure one of them i believe is called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Chili Tepid</ENAMEX> and the other one is called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pequine</ENAMEX> and um
 		they're they're little tiny hot things that we she takes them inside and she dries them and then we eat and
 	
 	
 		i've heard of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chili</ENAMEX> but i've never heard of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pequine</ENAMEX> what are they are they green red and yellow what
 	
 	
 		they're little green
 		literally pea size peppers they're they're just little tiny <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> and they dry up even smaller than they are when they're they're you know fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> on the um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> but the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> are just incredibly prodigious they just produce zillions of them um
 	
 	
 		
 
 		what do you use them for mainly
 	
 	
 		uh all kinds of dishes we like i say we grind them up and um we freeze some of them and then use them in stews and uh whenever we make egg dishes or anything like that we tend to
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		to put some on it it's just incredible with the numbers of ways that we come up to use them
 		and uh it's it's funny i mean we were laughing at ourselves <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one night</TIMEX> because we uh we realized that um we had uh  we were having it with every <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">meal</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but anyway it it's uh it's something that we enjoy immensely and it we get a lot of pleasure out of i love tilling up the garden <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every year</TIMEX> and um uh you know getting out there and just spending some
