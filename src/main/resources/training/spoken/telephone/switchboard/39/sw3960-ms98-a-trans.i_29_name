 		well i'm not uh painting of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">artist</ENAMEX>
 		variety what i like to do is i like to paint the inside of a house
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		paint cabinets or paint furniture
 		but i'm not doing much of that right now haven't for quite some time
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		how about you
 	
 	
 		well i painted a shed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this summer</TIMEX> that i built and i went and borrowed a
 		uh a paint sprayer from a a fellow that i know i'm good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> with
 		and it's the only way to go  i painted <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">eight gallons</NUMEX> of paint um i i put some stain and stuff on a on a redwood deck i made and i painted the uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		my shed and it probably took me <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about six hours</TIMEX> but it was just it's just incredible how much easier it is uh with a spray gun how much smoother it goes on and even and more professional looking and
 		um i don't know i was just really pleased with it do you use some kind of a power <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">painter rollers</ENAMEX> or something when you paint or
 	
 	
 		just just uh
 		old fashioned brush and roller yes yeah when
 	
 	
 		is that right
 		you you
 		you do it the hard way i shouldn't
 	
 	
 		yes uh a a very messy way too uh we haven't done much painting
 	
 	
 		these sound so hard but
 		
  
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interior</ENAMEX> or exterior in the last uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years two and a half years</TIMEX> we we bought a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mobile home</ENAMEX> and with the natural oak
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		or natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wood</ENAMEX> paneling on the inside we don't have that painting to
 		to contend with but uh my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> has painted uh some of our storage <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> and
 		when he put the uh
 		skirting around the the mobile home then it had to be
 		uh
 		sealed painted
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		um
 		how do you uh oh i would imagine
 		that the weather's pretty hard on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">paints</ENAMEX> down there is it is it not
 	
 	
 		yes it is uh probably the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summers the summers</TIMEX> are harder <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winters</TIMEX> actually than the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winters</TIMEX> are because it uh the sun you know bakes and dries them out and we don't have an a lot of freezing weather like you would in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Idaho</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		uh-huh how frequently do you have to paint then
 	
 	
 		uh usually not more often than about every oh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three to five years</TIMEX> depending on the type of finish that you use and too the the type of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wood</ENAMEX> that you're putting it on
 	
 	
 		how how do you uh prep your wood
 		is there a fast easy way or is it just the old scraper brush on the outside is i guess what i'm speaking of
 	
 	
 		oh that is the um the only thing that that i know of we um
 		were fortunate in that the last uh
 		painting work that my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> did was
 		on new finish so it didn't have to be
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		prepped anyway
 		we had painted uh or had paint i had a house painted that we owned over in uh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greenville</ENAMEX> and we had it brushed and scraped
 		and uh a primer coat brushed on and then the in fact i think there was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> coats of primer and then <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> coats of the
 		uh paint that went on that it was an old frame frame <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> but it lasted very very well it must have been on there <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nearly ten years</TIMEX> before it needed painting again
 	
 	
 		hm
 		inside how do you keep the paint off your carpet
 		or do you have that problem  anytime i try something like that i got paint all over the carpet
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and we're in there with uh i have to use <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> base paint and and uh in there with a big wet towel and
 		about every <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three minutes</TIMEX> i got to stop and clean my paint specks up all over
 	
 	
 		yeah that sounds familiar too my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> hates to see me get the painting bug because he says i'm i make a a terrible mess and i guess i do but um
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		uh in the times that he has helped me taping the uh one of those plastic drop cloths to the baseboard
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		and then setting chairs or something against it to keep the
 		keep it from getting kicked loose
 		is about the best way to keep it
 		you know from
 		speckling all around
