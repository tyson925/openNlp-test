 		you know uh i mean he wears <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wool</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX> but it's a lighter weight and it it it is uh a lot thinner so it breathes better than a a polyester would
 	
 	
 		
  
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wool</ENAMEX> does and and i wear suits occasionally at work at but a lot of it depends on
 		what what i've got going like if i've if i'm gonna be meeting with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
