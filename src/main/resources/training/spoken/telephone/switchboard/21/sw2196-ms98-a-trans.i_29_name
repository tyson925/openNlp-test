 
     		
 	
 		the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> that uh we bought back in the early eighties
 		was uh was was typical tract home and we were
 		uh trying to find something that would would get us into the housing market as it were thinking that someday we'd move on uh the economy however changed that a little bit and looks like we're going to be in this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> for a while but uh it's not too bad
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 	
 	
 		some of the things that we didn't uh think about
 		when we bought it turned out uh
 		worked out all right for us was we bought on a top of a hill
 		and some of our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> down the the lower part uh get their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">yards</ENAMEX> flooded every once in a while doesn't get up into the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> but it just makes a bit of a mess in the in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">yard</ENAMEX> itself a little bit of debris and a little bit of runoff on the
 	
 	
 		uh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		on the uh grass area it's kind of hard to keep grass in certain areas and i'd never really thought about that but but we're pretty much at the very top of this little hill and all the runoff from
 		from the concrete uh the shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> near us and the alleyway all that goes down to our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> so so that was a little thing that i'd never really considered and was fortunate that it worked out that way
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh another uh calamity i guess that befalls some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">purchasers</ENAMEX> that i didn't uh think about when i <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> purchased this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> was
 		what can happen right immediately behind you we are on the edge of a development that has a little retainer wall that separates us from the rest of the from a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> and a little little uh business area
 		and uh some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> of ours moved into a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of years later</TIMEX> a a uh shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> built up behind them and it was a grocery <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX> that had that stocked at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about three am every night</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh no
 	
 	
 		they would run the trash compactor and it was so loud it would wake them up and they never got used to it and they finally had to move they just couldn't stand that noise
 		then oddly enough after that they uh uh it it it closed down now that grocery <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX> isn't there and hasn't been there for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about six years</TIMEX> now so
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh it's kind of a a bad thing to happen but we happen to have landed again in a very lucky spot there is a little business development behind us that's a bit of a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a</NUMEX> a little <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX> and a couple of dry cleaning things and
 		little strip shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> but it's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> down because the property that's the other side of our little wall is a triangle shape
 		and the wedge part of the triangle got too skinny to do anything more than put some grass and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> there there's not even a parking lot so it it's a nice uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two or three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> on either side of us is nice <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">grass</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		oh good
 	
 	
 		and then across from that is a a major <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> lane <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> and then across from that is
 		is uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">parks</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> that we live in has some soccer <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">fields</ENAMEX> and some baseball <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">fields</ENAMEX> and that completely goes on to the horizon so as far as we can look out over our little retaining wall is grass and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> and parks
 	
 	
 		oh that's really nice
 	
 	
 		and we really didn't didn't uh
 		i mean that wasn't our consideration when when we bought it it was a complete blank lot they hadn't even built the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> yet and we were new to the this whole process and all we knew is that it was a the cheapest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> that this this tract development uh sold
 		so it turned out to be pretty good and
 	
 	
 		where do you what area do you live in oh okay i live in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> uh Rowlett
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX>
 		yeah it's uh it's a nice area as it were about the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> things that uh didn't work out too well for us well one of them's nice in in a way we're on the beginning of a corner we live on a on a
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U</ENAMEX> shaped drive and we're the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> that they actually started turning
 		to make for a turn on a on a cul-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">de</ENAMEX>-sac not a cul-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">de</ENAMEX>-sac but a turn on a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ninety</NUMEX> degree turn on the street which meant that we're not jammed right up against our <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX>'s house
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh that's really nice
 	
 	
 		there's there's like twelve or <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">fifteen feet</NUMEX> on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> side but on the other side there's <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">over sixty feet</NUMEX> before the next <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> because they they set us back a little ways and they turned it sideways
 		so our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> begin to to turn to to make this turn as it were so we're real far away and we have a really large lot we have a bigger <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lot</ENAMEX> than all the rest of the the ones down the street
 		but uh as it turned out we decided we learned that neither one of us really likes taking care of all that grass so it it was a bit of a drawback but uh it'll probably make for a good selling point if we ever give it to someone that does like all that grass
 	
 	
 		oh
 		yeah it probably will
 	
 	
 		and uh we did also end up in a in an area that we didn't we didn't realize when we bought it that uh the soil is that uh black <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">clay</ENAMEX> and it
 	
 	
 		yeah we have that
 	
 	
 		it tends to uh go to the extremes of being dry or being moist and it it's done a little bit of a foundation damage that uh most of these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> get no matter how much watering we do
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so we have to contend with doors that sometimes sometimes the during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> don't uh
 		just close just right and uh things of that nature
 	
 	
 		right i guess that's just Texas though you have to live with that
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true there are there is a little segment little segment up near <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McKinney</ENAMEX> and up near um
 		uh they said out near <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wylie</ENAMEX> there's some
 		some little areas where the soil is completely sandy and then it it uh goes back into the black gumbo around it
 	
 	
 		hum
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but there are some housing developments that uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> that came out and inspected our damage was saying that there are some little little pockets of neighborhoods that don't have these problems at all and had i only known you know maybe i'd have looked over there
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		uh what about your house
 	
 	
 		well we bought uh our <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> at the end of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eighty six</NUMEX> and like i said it's out in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rowlett</ENAMEX> and it's it's real nice it's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedroom</ENAMEX> and it's kind of a tract area too we've got <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> behind us and on both sides of us
 		i don't really like that too well i keep telling my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> that our next <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX> is going to sit <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> in the middle of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">at least ten acres</NUMEX> of land
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but uh it's a it's a good size and it's something we can stay in and grow in for quite a while i guess uh hopefully till the real estate market turns around like you we
 		we bought when it was down a little bit but we've had so many repossessions in our neighborhood that we couldn't sell for anywhere near what we've got into it so
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it uh hopefully it'll turn around
 	
 	
 		it's true that there's always that chance i guess
 	
 	
 		sometime
 		yeah oh i think it will eventually out here they're building more new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> all the time though and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> can go and buy a brand new one that's never been lived in for less than they can get a used one so i guess that's what they would choose
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		but there uh well as a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time home <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">buyer</ENAMEX> i know what you mean there's a lot of things you're not sure about what to look out for the only really trouble we've had with our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> is the seals breaking between the double panes and water moisture
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		gets in there and you can hardly see out of them now they've got so much
 		and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">builder</ENAMEX>'s gone bankrupt and the glass <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>'s gone bankrupt so we don't really have any recourse and just hope they break or something
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		nothing you can do
 		that's right there's nothing you can do
 	
 	
 		yeah but other than that we haven't had any problems
 	
 	
 		yeah we've got
 		we've got <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> that's done that uh we've been pretty fortunate most of our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> have had many more um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i don't know that we've done anything different to prevent ours from doing that but most of our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> have ended up replacing them uh buying some nice <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anderson</ENAMEX> windows or some
 		some uh name brand windows uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX> went with whatever <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sears</ENAMEX> installs and they have the the
 		different kind of window that the kind that you can tilt out either pane and and raise or lower you know lower the top down or the bottom up or tilt it in both of them tilt in so you can clean them or and it's a real strange
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mechanical beast</ENAMEX> but uh they haven't lost their seal yet so it's i guess there's a quality some quality in it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		we we had um our insurance our home <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">owner</ENAMEX>'s insurance actually covered some of it because i told them it looks like something's eating into the glass it turns like a milky white you know so i said well how do we know it wasn't some kind of chemical or something that's eating into that which would be covered under a glass rider so
 	
 	
 		so
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		they replaced like <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> of them
 		and we just had to pay the deductible but
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		they wouldn't that insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> went out of business in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> because they had so many claims that they couldn't make a profit and so now none of the other insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> will will consider covering that
 	
 	
 		goodness
 		yeah that's
 	
 	
 		which i can understand it's really not
 	
 	
 		that'd be hard to hard to cover all the ones that go bad
 	
 	
 		damaged
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		it's true
 	
 	
 		but i bet we've got <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least seven</NUMEX> more now that are bad
 	
 	
 		goodness
 	
 	
 		just about every window in our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> i guess eventually is going to have to be replaced
 	
 	
 		yeah and it'd be nice to do it with with all the same kind too
 	
 	
 		yeah well what they did is just they came in and just cut the glass out of the frame and put more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glass</ENAMEX> in
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		that's over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year ago</TIMEX> and it's it hasn't had any problems yeah seemed to
 	
 	
 		and those held
 		that's interesting i didn't know they could do that
 	
 	
 		somebody told me that they thought that too was caused by just a little bit of shifting in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">foundation</ENAMEX> puts a little pressure on that seal and makes them pop open
 	
 	
 		yeah that could be but once you get that moisture in there it
 		it can fog up and not go away quickly enough
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		well i hear my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX> calling me i better go see what he wants  okay bye
 	
 	
 		
 
 		okay well it was good talking to you  bye
