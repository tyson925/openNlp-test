 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hi Frank</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		how do you feel about uh lawn and garden work
 	
 	
 		uh well to tell you the truth my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> does most of the work yeah i feel real good about it
 	
 	
 		so you feel good about it
 		what kind of a system does he have does he have a power mower or a riding mower
 	
 	
 		yeah no he has a um
 		you know um a push mower i mean it's electric of course um i i think it's not very old about
 		um not that old <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three or four years old</TIMEX> maybe and uh he he really enjoys it so
 	
 	
 		so you let him enjoy it
 	
 	
 		yeah that's fine
 	
 	
 		you don't feel  you don't feel guilty about it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		no well
 		last uh no i do enough other things i don't feel guilty about that
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> this is i'm almost ashamed to admit it but <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> for the very first time i did mow the grass
 		my <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time in my whole life
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and uh that wasn't too bad i it was good exercise
 	
 	
 		it's a it's a push mower though
 	
 	
 		well you know it's electric of course i mean it's a power a power mower it it's it's pretty powerful oh yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah but it's it's power power but you have to push it i've uh i've got to admit that the last <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> lawn mowers that i've gotten um were uh power driven
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		they're they're uh you know they're gasoline and they have a mechanical contraption on it you pull the handle and it pulls the lawn mower for you
 		um it takes me about an hour to do to to do my lawn
 	
 	
 		that's about the same for ours
 	
 	
 		and uh well if you if you got got him a power mower it'd probably take him a lot less time to do it but i enjoy doing it i feel good doing it uh
 		i i feel a lot better doing it with a
 		power mower with that with a  with a pull <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">tractor</ENAMEX> on it so i don't have to push so hard
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh i enjoy going and cutting the grass i like the way it looks
 		and uh
 		i also have other other garden equipment like uh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">weed</ENAMEX> whacker or the trimmer to go around all of the the uh fence and everything
 	
 	
 		oh yeah uh-huh
 	
 	
 		does he have those as well
 	
 	
 		oh yes um let's see we've got a
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">weed</ENAMEX> whacker we have an uh edger you know that goes between the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">grass</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sidewalk</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh this this comes with the blade on it you mean uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um
 		right um
 	
 	
 		is that a power mower or is that a power edger or is it a
 	
 	
 		that one is electric so he's got to plug that in and drag the cord around
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and let's see um hedge clippers you know electric of course <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">hedge hedge</ENAMEX> clippers
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um i think that's all of the power tools we have
 		we um but that's that's i think that's about all they make
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		how often does he do it
 	
 	
 		oh once a week um actually though um we just moved
 	
 	
 		all right
 	
 	
 		to uh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year and a half</TIMEX> ago
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and they have a new uh
 		system that they're trying to promote here which is uh they don't bag it as they call it um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		essentially you know cutting it um probably more like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every four or five days</TIMEX> and
 		so it's still short enough so that you can mulch it back into the grass
 		and never bag it for one thing um cuts down on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waste</ENAMEX> for landfills and all of that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		so so the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> is encouraging you to do that
 	
 	
 		um it's actually through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">County Extension Service</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and they put out all kinds of information on it
 		and then they put up uh they had a few <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">lawns</ENAMEX> in the area that were like uh samples and they put a big sign in their yard that said you know this is a don't bag it lawn
 		and let you watch and see how they did it so their grass clippings were never bagged they just mulch back into the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">grass</ENAMEX> itself and acted as a fertilizer
 	
 	
 		do they do something to the lawn mower to to help it uh stay inside or they
 	
 	
 		yeah as a matter of fact and our lawn mower does that too it's you you shut off the where the bag would go or where it would you know <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spray</ENAMEX> out the side
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so that it just mulches underneath it just goes back down um right underneath the blade
 	
 	
 		but they don't they they they have special munching <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mulching uh mowers</ENAMEX> but that's not one of them
 	
 	
 		right
 		no that's no that's not it's not necessary to have that nope
 	
 	
 		it is not
 		oh i always thought that it was
 	
 	
 		but you
 		you you have to but you're you're right though in that you do have to cut it though when it's
 		um relatively short you can't let it go <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a week or two</TIMEX> because if the clippings are that long then they'll just lay on top
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		they have to be short enough that they'll still fall back down um into the grass
 	
 	
 		oh that's interesting
 		maybe there's something i can try this time around
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it takes takes him a lot less time because even though he does have to do it every <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four or five days</TIMEX>
 		um since he doesn't have to bag all of those clippings you know it rather than taking i don't know as an example <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an hour and a half</TIMEX> to do the whole lawn it only takes <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an hour</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		so you know plus less bags less waste
 	
 	
 		does he have the lawn treated
 	
 	
 		um we tried that but we really weren't happy with it so he does that all himself now
 	
 	
 		oh well i um i tried it about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten years ago</TIMEX> and i've been doing it ever since i've been having it treated
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and it makes it grow much faster uh
 		our season though in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New England</ENAMEX> uh is is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">only three months</TIMEX> or so and then it starts getting cold again in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh that's true
 	
 	
 		so we don't have um i guess out in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> you must have a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a longer</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh gee i'd i'd say our grass is getting green right now so i'm sure he'll in fact he may have already cut it once i can't remember
 	
 	
 		no kidding
 		no kidding
 	
 	
 		um but it'll be yeah we'll have to start cutting real soon
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		then oh well in on into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October November</TIMEX> i'm sure
 	
 	
 		oh we i i don't go that uh that deep it starts getting cold when as soon as the cold weather comes it stunts the growth of the uh the grass
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i know in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX> time i've got to uh i've got to hold actually hold it as long as i can uh as long as i can make the grass
 		i can't cut it i think it's the recommended <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">three three and a half inches</NUMEX> they want me to leave it
 		so i can cut it
 	
 	
 		let it get that long wow
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX> time so that the heat doesn't uh burn the grass
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and they recommend that i keep the blade very high
 		s o because it's that high i have to do it frequently as well i try to do it every uh uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six or seven days</TIMEX>
 		if
 	
 	
 		what kind of grass do you have
 	
 	
 		um i really i've got a mixture i guess
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it's all different kinds but if i let it grow too long if i let it go like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a week</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a half two weeks</TIMEX> then it starts seeding on me
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and that's it gets too long and then it uh starts bunching up underneath the lawn mower and i can't get it out and and it's uh it it turns out to be a real mess so i've got to do it uh
 		uh no later than once a week
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and i uh i don't block off my my uh chute but i don't pick up my grass either
 		i leave it on the lawn and uh i try to go over it again i do pick up or i rake up uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know the clumps that uh that occur but i try to leave it down there
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i did pick up uh a lawn sweeper
 	
 	
 		oh really we don't have one of those
 	
 	
 		yeah that's kind of that's kind of like uh the old-fashioned carpet sweeper only it's it's wide and you put it on your grass and what it does is it sweeps the lawn and it only picks up
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh
 	
 	
 		you know the height that you you set it at so i set it very high and it just picks or it skims the grass it doesn't dig way down deep so i don't have a lot of grass that i uh that i collect
 	
 	
 		does it work for leaves
 	
 	
 		oh yeah works very good with leaves because leaves typically if you pick them up right away uh they'll sit on top of the grass
 	
 	
 		oh
 		right
 	
 	
 		and uh i'm trying to find a way how to uh electrify it or motorize it because of this i have to push
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but it uh it's it's wide enough to pick up uh like the width <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> widths of a lawn mower
 	
 	
 		oh well
 	
 	
 		so you can do it relatively quickly
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		well that's sounds interesting we uh we don't
 		well i don't know if we do that very much
 		i think i remember my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mom</ENAMEX> had one of those
 	
 	
 		i  i try to take the the clippings and uh
 	
 	
 		i don't know
 	
 	
 		put them in a mulching not a mulching but uh
 		to let them decompose
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i think that is mulching uh what do they call that
 	
 	
 		a compost pile right
 	
 	
 		compost pile
 		i haven't been very successful i'm on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">my third year</TIMEX> now and i still have a a pile in the back yard and it it doesn't decompose i guess i got
 	
 	
 		it's not composting
 	
 	
 		you supposed to put <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemicals</ENAMEX> on it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i don't think so no i think it's supposed to be natural
 	
 	
 		no
 		
  
 		it's
 		it's not working
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		oh well
 	
 	
 		it's getting it's shrinking down it's getting small
 		but it uh it's still grass it's it's dried up <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">grass</ENAMEX> and it it just stays there it doesn't turn into dirt
 	
 	
 		i think you're supposed to turn it every once in a while
 	
 	
 		what air it out
 	
 	
 		well i think it it on the inside is where it the chemicals you know it starts to break down
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i think if you're supposed to turn it
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		i mean not not very often but you know go in and and stir it up so to speak to get the
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		stuff on the outside in to the inside
 	
 	
 		i'm going to have to try and do that
 	
 	
 		it might help i don't know
 		
 
 	
 	
 		maybe it'll work
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh the other thing i was thinking of doing is getting some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemicals</ENAMEX> to try and help the process up uh a little more a little faster
 	
 	
 		i don't know i i i think the idea is supposed to be natural so that
 		you know there's no
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemicals</ENAMEX> no <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemicals</ENAMEX> in it
 	
 	
 		no <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemicals</ENAMEX> and plus then you can use it as a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fertilizer</ENAMEX> and not have to worry about
 		spreading those <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemicals</ENAMEX> like on your lawn or your <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">bushes</ENAMEX> or whatever
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i um i'm seriously thinking of discontinuing the chemical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">service</ENAMEX> because of the uh
 		um i guess what i didn't realize was that that they're actually putting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">poisons</ENAMEX> on my grass
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and it wasn't until uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year or two ago</TIMEX> where the state required anyone putting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemicals</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">lawns</ENAMEX> that they tell the the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> what they're actually putting on the lawn and what the uh the hazards are
 		and uh my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> are all grown up <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">now</TIMEX> but
 		when they were younger i was fertilizing my grass and didn't realize that some of the the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemicals</ENAMEX> that are on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">grass</ENAMEX> that are being put on by the chemical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> um stay there longer than
 		than than <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a few hours</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		and they're playing on they were playing on it
 	
 	
 		and yeah and my <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">uh dog</ENAMEX> was out there playing in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">grass</ENAMEX> and they were playing in the grass so i don't what long term effects that they uh the chemicals
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		had on the grass but that's bothered me to the point where i'm thinking thinking about discontinuing it this year
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and try to get more uh
