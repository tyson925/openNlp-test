 		oh you're from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Carolina</ENAMEX> where in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Carolina</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Raleigh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		Raleigh great my name's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mary</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		so
 		my name is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fernando</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fernando</ENAMEX> glad to know you
 	
 	
 		so um do you work how'd you find out about this
 	
 	
 		uh i was visiting my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> down in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh okay he works for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh no no but his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> has a contract with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> and that's how we learned about it um-hum
 	
 	
 		oh okay because i'm down at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NC State</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah um-hum
 	
 	
 		and so i took a class and he said sign up and get some money and just talk for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five minutes</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		so are you ready
 	
 	
 		i'm ready
 	
 	
 		okay let's get started
 	
 	
 		all right okay
 	
 	
 		
 
 		okay
 		so uh what do you think uh that uh what what what what do you think we can do to solve the crime in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh if i knew that i'd be a very wealthy person
 	
 	
 		yeah but what what what are the steps
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well you have to see i a as the way i look at it you have to think <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of all why or has has crime increased and if so why has crime increased
 	
 	
 		well see the problem is is that um
 		what happens is as that you're uh you know as you go from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> to a city crime always increases right because in the country <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> still respect uh the property of other people
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		right
 	
 	
 		and so as as and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> don't want as much as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in the city
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		now what happens is all those that don't have any money in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> move to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> and they wish to get the same thing they say why can't we have the same things that these other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have
 		and the thing that we can do is we need money for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> and what we have to do is we have to go there get some stuff steal it and then you know  resell it
 	
 	
 		it's easy you said the magic word there drugs
 	
 	
 		which one
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and that certainly is one reason why crime here has increased
 	
 	
 		that's uh that's uh the main reason i think uh everywhere because uh you have deaths i mean i mean you have murders and you have you know <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> stealing other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>'s stuff and that's a lot of it has to do with drugs
 	
 	
 		oh yes
 	
 	
 		it doesn't have to do i mean the thing is is that you know it's like you might be standing somewhere
 		right and like let's say you're you you go you know you're driving out and you're driving back home and it's <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">late at night</TIMEX> and you stop by one of these you know <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty four hour</TIMEX> you know gas <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stations</ENAMEX> joints
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh somebody walks in there with a gun i mean they're going to want the money and you can tell by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who are always caught that these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are there to get money for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> i mean they don't want the money so uh so they can do something else with it
 	
 	
 		now they don't want the money for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> that's for sure
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right right and so
 	
 	
 		well but you know the the strange thing uh perhaps not strange but something that many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> don't realize is that you can go back as far as nineteen fifty <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one and fifty two</NUMEX> and find that there were <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		at that time trying to influence the high school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> because uh i'm a retired educator
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		and uh in fifty <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one and fifty two</NUMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> came to the high school where i was
 		and were telling us how to recognize when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> were on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> how to recognize the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pushers</ENAMEX> outside the one entrance that they were giving their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> away in order to get the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> started and so on and so on
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so it's a problem that's been around for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">over forty</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> and we're just really uh uh now trying to uh figure out how to cope with the problem because it has grown so huge
 	
 	
 		yeah there's a there's a a song that i know which says you know that it's like in uh nineteen <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eighty eight</NUMEX> nineteen <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eighty nine</NUMEX> the local state and federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> spent
 		the least amount of money on crime in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		and uh i their figures i think are true so i mean it's like compared to you know compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX> and stuff like that i mean you're spending nothing on on crime in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> itself what you're doing is
 		you you know it's like you have other things you know it's like you have the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> we're going to solve try to solve the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> problem while while you know some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are getting killed here and there and then
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		you know the uh another one of the problems is that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who are
 		the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX> the big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">dealers</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> may be may be part of the power structure that's keeping us from spending the money in that direction
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		but those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> never get caught the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that
 	
 	
 		that's right they'll never get caught
 	
 	
 		that that i see their theory is that if i'm surrounded and i'm going to be caught i'm going to try to pry my way through and they're not going to take me alive
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but i have such a big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX> outside of my place that nobody can touch me
 	
 	
 		that's right but they'll
 	
 	
 		you know it's like of course i mean i might be you know the the leading <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dealer</ENAMEX> here but you won't find me dealing in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> i mean there's no connection between me and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that you caught you know
 	
 	
 		that's right
 		that's right then <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> doesn't know the other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> down the line
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> at the very top the one who's who's really making the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">the millions</NUMEX> is the one who also many times is part of the power structure uh the uh and had the political
 		uh pull to keep things from uh keep the interest or the uh emphasis in some other direction other than on the drug dealing because it sure is monstrous in this country
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i was i was at a at a party on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> and this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> comes up he goes hey how you doing whatever and then he started talking to me and this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> was from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jamaica</ENAMEX> right and he's got his little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> selling drugs
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know and he goes yeah i just came up here to work and i go oh you did i bet you make uh very good money up here he goes yeah i make a lot a lot of money he goes you know and uh in the movie <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Good Fellas</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah right
 	
 	
 		did you see it
 	
 	
 		nope i only heard about it
 	
 	
 		okay in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> part the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> goes out of jail and within uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two months</TIMEX> he had all his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX> payments done everything paid and you know and he had enough money to you know it's like

 		yeah well you know even in our prison systems they're finding that they're they're having drugs smuggled into them
