 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		so what do you think about it should
 	
 	
 		um i like the idea of nursing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> as a as a growing
 		choice the choices you have in nursing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> now whereas used to you used to have only you put you know when when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> got to the point where they were debilitated and couldn't take care of themselves and there was no other choice you couldn't take them in your own <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> then they went into a nursing home you know maybe you lived
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		too far away to care for them or your <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> job or whatever prevented it
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but um i like the choices you have now where they can go into an <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> type setting and have some basically have a independent lifestyle but assisted care
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and then if things deteriorate they can go to a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> level which is
 		you know like where they prepare their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meals</ENAMEX> for them and and they still live somewhat independently but they have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> checking on them and making sure they have hot <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meals</ENAMEX> and then where the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> a lot of times will also have the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> level which is full care
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know where some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> can't where they're in a wheelchair or where they're in a bed and they can't get around but then they have full care but i really like those those options <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">now and</TIMEX> and i think about it more often because my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>'s parents
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		are they're very active <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">right now</TIMEX> but they're seventy <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five and and seventy two</TIMEX>
 		so that comes up somewhat more often in my thoughts as i see these things because of their age
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yes um it's it's funny because um i know <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> at that are in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that work you know i know someone that works works in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> different stages like you said
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i have known you know <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> close to me that have been in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> and i have seen them like go from where they're in an apartment <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> they we call it um
 		well we have high rises and it's just for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elderly people</ENAMEX> you know or most of most of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spouses</ENAMEX> has already passed away
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and it's really nice for them because then they're with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> their own age and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that have gone through things exactly what they have gone through
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and it's it's really nice to go and see them you know where they can still get around and everything and they still you know do their own thing
 		but it's it's really nice to see them because i mean sometimes like i had a great <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aunt</ENAMEX> she lived with us for um <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three months</TIMEX> and because she's starting to get <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Alzheimer's disease</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i know i have a bunch of younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brothers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sisters</ENAMEX> and i know it was hard for me as well as it was for them to to actually sit down because she doesn't like doing things that the younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> like doing
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and to actually sit so it's really nice to see that
 	
 	
 		yeah that's some of the things i would find important before i i would look into that for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> is is is like you're saying a good mix of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who have the same interests and uh and the programs here they have different
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh besides just different levels within the same program they have different types of programs they have several areas they have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> area in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> where the people
 		i guess a lot of it comes with money it this this one area is a bit more expensive and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who probably are living there have had more money in their life but but things that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> where they have similar interests
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		like you're saying and the programs that they have where where some of them will have dances once a week and some of them <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sponsor</ENAMEX> different crafts and they go to the arboretum to see things and they make sure that if they want to go to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> there's a bus there
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and it'll or you know or someone will transport them to a specific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> even though it's
 		you know maybe it's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> away because it's a big you know <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> area is a big metropolitan area but a lot of these places have have <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">churches</ENAMEX> or have have individual transportation that's that's something i'd look for something that would make me happy
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		personally if i had to live there because i don't think a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> really even in the nice ones and even in the ones where they can live fairly independently they really don't necessarily like it because they're not in their own home
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so i think those kinds of things to make it more home like and to make it more um
 		enjoyable for them that'd that'd be one thing i'd look for along with the uh health care aspects to make sure they had you know that it was clean and that they had good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctors</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurses</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah um i'm in college and i'm i'm <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">only twenty one</TIMEX> but we had a speech i had a speech class <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last semester</TIMEX> and there was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> in my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> who did a speech on home care of the elderly
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i was so surprised to hear how many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> like whenever they're in you know the older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> they're like um fastened to their beds so they can't get out just because they you know they wander the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">halls</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and they get the wrong medicine just because you know the the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aides</ENAMEX> or whoever just give them the wrong <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX> and so many of them you know are
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		are overmedicated too
 	
 	
 		yes and it was it was awful to hear what you know what some of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> really went through And i forget the percentage of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that you know that she had said and this was i mean she did research on it and everything
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah that's one of the things that that we don't think about as we get older and the the money that it now requires
 		to uh be in one of these places because some of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that are just on social security and if they don't have any living <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> perhaps they never had <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> or if their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> you know passed away before they did they can be in some places that are
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know that that are not good where they they have very minimum minimal care and the the care that they are getting the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who are giving it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		are probably are paid at a minimum wage and they just do they don't care as much and and like you said they're trying to make it the caretakers in some cases are trying to make easy on themselves
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		to the point where they're putting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in bed or overmedicating them so they'll stay in one spot and not do anything that certainly would be something to to watch for because you've got with some of them being some of these places can even be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">three thousand dollars</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a month</TIMEX> to stay in fee
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		i know and some and sometimes they share a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> and it's just a little cubbyhole and they share it with another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> and they're still paying that much it it it just sometimes it just seems ridiculous
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh yeah so you've
 		yeah you've got to really strike a balance in what kind of care
 		what kind of level of care you need and then what you can unfortunately what you can afford at the same time
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh uh</ENAMEX>-huh yeah um i've been lucky well
 		my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mom</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">um parents</ENAMEX> they're both in their
 		in their uh eighties and i was just home for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">spring</TIMEX> break and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandma</ENAMEX> said something to me about she goes well maybe we'll just sell the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> she said it's getting too big for us to take care of and i was like no no no stay in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> as long as you can
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well like there are other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> too that aren't necessarily a nursing home i had an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aunt</ENAMEX> who lived in a small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> that um was in a
 		it was a it was a housing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX> each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> had their own little bitty <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> that they had built and it was um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		supplemented their they were most of them were on social security and they got some kind of supplemental aid besides from the state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> but it was this little bitty <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedroom house</ENAMEX>
 		but it was a separate <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and they had a living room and a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedroom</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen</ENAMEX> and a bathroom
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so they still had they had and they had <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who came in who um supervised them all these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> were like <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fifteen</ENAMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty</TIMEX> of them all right together kind of like on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">block</ENAMEX> and they had a a supervisory um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		wasn't a house really it was it was more like a
 	
 	
 		it sounds like uh an <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> or some
 	
 	
 		a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX> or something anyway where they they staffed it <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> shifts a day so that someone if they needed someone they could ri ng and and someone could come to their house
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and that and they always cooked then they had they had the choice you know they lived in their own little <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX> they had their own <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">possessions</ENAMEX> still in there to some extent you know some of them
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and they could make their own breakfast if they wanted to and their own dinner and they always had somebody come in for lunch
 		but they had <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who did you know they didn't have to mess with the yard they had <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who did the yard and they had a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">maid</ENAMEX> that uh uh service that came in and cleaned everybody's <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> so they didn't have to worry about that and it was really a nice
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		it was really a nice compromise especially because she felt like she was still living in her own <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and she still had her own <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couch</ENAMEX> and her own bed and it it really helped a lot and she was a lot more comfortable and she didn't
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		see now we've run into a lot of problems where our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> were well i've lived here for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty years</TIMEX> and we've built this and this is our home and we have nothing else to show for our lives and we don't want to leave uh we've run into a lot of that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh yeah
 		yeah it would be hard to that's that's why this she was she felt that way too but when it helped that she got to still be in a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and still have some of her own stuff
 	
 	
 		um
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i guess that that it was a pilot program i think where she lived so it's probably not widely available
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah that's what like well um
 		now i know we have an old we call it an old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX> home but it's basically a nursing home too but everyone has basically their own room
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and they're allow you know they none of them have <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> because they can't drive
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but if someone would come to get them you know they're allowed to leave with them and there's a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> there that makes supper for them and each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> has a chore like maybe <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> it's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George</ENAMEX>'s turn to set all the tables
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		and it's really nice because that keeps them going too rather than just sitting around and i know um our youth <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> goes over and we play bingo with them and you know like stuff like that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well that's good
 		everybody needs some sense of responsibility
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah just to keep them going
 	
 	
 		an even even if it's just a little bit yeah
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so it's it's more like living with a big in a big <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> where it's your turn to to set the table like you're saying or whatever instead of being waited on hand and foot all the time yeah that would be nice
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		but i think before i like you i don't think you i don't think it's right to just put someone in it i think they would have to agree to go in it
 	
 	
 		yes unless they're at a point where they're mentally incapacitated
 	
 	
 		well yeah
 	
 	
 		say like you're saying with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Alzheimer's</ENAMEX> and
 		going to be
 		
 
 		the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who have to be there
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that's when it's important to really check out the medical aspects of it when you're when you're in something like that that they'll get the kind of medical care they want without or
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 		overdoing it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
