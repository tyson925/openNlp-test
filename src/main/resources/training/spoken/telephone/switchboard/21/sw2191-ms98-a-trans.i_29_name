 
     		
 	
 		
 
 		well i uh before i was married i used to play a lot of sports
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh but when i got married  and had <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and everything it seems like i keep all my activity just chasing around
 		fulfilling my obligations so i haven't done a lot of uh exercise on purpose what about you
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well  it's funny <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this week yesterday</TIMEX> i started exercising seriously
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this weekend</TIMEX> i cleaned out my closets and uh  <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple years ago</TIMEX> i too got married i haven't have any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> yet but <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this weekend</TIMEX> i cleaned out some closets and i found a bathing suit that i had bought
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		tried it on and decided i really did not like how it looked on me
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh no that can be awful
 	
 	
 		so <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> i went to uh a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">spa</ENAMEX> i belong to a private <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">spa</ENAMEX> and went in and and got with a trainer
 		and uh he checked body fat content and we set up a program for me to work on and i went back tonight also
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh that's good
 	
 	
 		so i've been <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two nights</TIMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a row</TIMEX> and i i'm going to take it pretty seriously i'm going to start going <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">every night</TIMEX> just you know even if i i like tonight i only went for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> but i at least did something
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		do you work out on like is it the weight machines or aerobics or what is it
 	
 	
 		last night i did  <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about thirty minutes</TIMEX> of riding a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bike</ENAMEX> and a few like <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> different types of uh uh weight lifting for my legs and and my hips
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and then i did <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a hour</TIMEX> of aerobics
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and that was really tough
 	
 	
 		oh i bet
 	
 	
 		and i was sore <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this morning</TIMEX> when i got up but then tonight i got into a a it's sort of like an aerobics class
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but it's <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">only thirty minutes</TIMEX> and it's for your abdominals your thighs and your butt
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		hum
 	
 	
 		so and that was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> was definitely plenty
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		doesn't sound like low impact
 	
 	
 		no it was a lot of sweat but
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		i've been trying to eat correctly also
 	
 	
 		well that's good
 	
 	
 		so have you started exercising at home or
 	
 	
 		so are you motivated
 		well i like i am undisciplined in the sense that i can't just go and do exercise
 		but i like to um
 		play <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">tennis</ENAMEX> and play racquetball i i like to get exercise when i'm playing a game of some sort and so that's always been the way that i have kept myself in uh the shape that i was satisfied with at least
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		And uh then i have given that up but uh i would really like to start that again because i am now you know not in a position that i like myself i don't feel
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		good and i get you know when you get out of shape and you don't if you're easily tired
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and so that has made me but i i'm not the kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> that could go to a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">spa</ENAMEX> and work out i just if something like uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i mean i have so many chores and so many obligations <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX> for to add another obligation would make me feel stressed
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i wouldn't enjoy it but if i have something some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> sport or some activity then it's kind of like having fun playing and then you then you get some of the
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um good exercise and some of the desired results but you you're doing it for fun
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah
 	
 	
 		but i really admire <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who can go and work out and
 	
 	
 		well i don't you know a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> i have a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girlfriend</ENAMEX> that goes for the social aspect of it and she walks around talks to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i don't really get into that naturally i'm married so my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> goes a lot and we'll go and and just do what we want to do and then leave
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		well that's nice
 	
 	
 		but yeah and swimming is a is a part that i i'd like to get into as far as my you know just aerobic activity
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		they say that swimming is real good so i'd like to try that as well and that's probably something that that you could do you know <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> included

 		it is kind
 		it is <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> and it's fun it's a fun thing and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> enjoy that and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and all and also the nice thing about belonging to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">club</ENAMEX> is that you can have some of the relaxation
 		you know like a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sauna</ENAMEX> or
 	
 	
 		yeah
