 
     		
 	
 		
 
 		all right
 	
 	
 		uh what kind of um
 		besides your besides your salary what's what's the most the thing that you would consider to be most important as a benefit
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well i guess uh
 		i i i'm kind of in uh in an unusual situation probably for this particular topic because i'm self-employed
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		have you ever worked for a large organization
 	
 	
 		but yes i have worked i've worked for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> and i've worked for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTV</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> and i suppose that uh
 		so far as benefits are concerned the most important
 		to uh me <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> would probably be uh something to do with retirement benefits
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		at at this point in my life though i'm i'm i'm a little older probably than you know than the typical new employee would be anyway uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		in you know in my younger days i i was interested in what's the vacation policy
 		and then as i matured a little bit you know i was more interested in what are the insurance benefits you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh so i i you know i guess it from my point of view it depends on
 		uh you know on
 		where you are in life as to what's most important
 	
 	
 		yeah probably because you said retirement and that really has not even occurred to me once
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		yeah
 		yeah uh you know if you're not uh if you haven't haven't looked forward to you know what are you going to do when you retire
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		when you get to the point where you're looking forward to it then it gets to be important because you've got to do some planning for it uh you know especially if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> is not doing it for you
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		there are you know there are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> that do and there <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> that don't you know that don't have good retirement plans
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh
 		i guess uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> that participate in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 401K</TIMEX> type plans where you know you have the the uh option of contributing to uh to a retirement plan
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh maybe even the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> does some kind of a matching program for that that's those are good programs uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i i i'm a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CPA</ENAMEX> so i look at you know i get to see a lot of these uh a lot of different programs and things and along that line
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh i like to see where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> makes those makes benefits available at least to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so that they can pick and chose what they like uh
 		you know there they've got <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> that they call a cafeteria plan i don't know whether you're familiar with that or not
 	
 	
 		no what is that
 	
 	
 		and uh essentially the cafeteria plans are programs where
 		the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> makes available a a different uh uh different packages of benefits you you know you can pick the kind of insurance you want and the kind of dental coverage and the kind of vacation policy you want an
 		and all of these different things and you pick the ones that you want as long as the total cost to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> essentially the total cost to the company
 		fits you know within their guidelines so every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX> gets the same dollar amount of benefits
 		but they can pick them from different whatever is most important to them
 	
 	
 		um no i hadn't heard of that
 	
 	
 		so you can uh so you can get you know you can get the insurance plan that's important to you and somebody else can get the vacation plan that's important to them
 		and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> winds up paying the same you know the same amount for each one
 	
 	
 		um
 		is that something that you should change from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> to year
 	
 	
 		uh i believe that you can that you can change well maybe not from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year to year</TIMEX> but at least you can change periodically
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> as to you know as to to get the stuff that's more important to you yeah that's uh something that the uh that the federal government you know put into uh you know into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IRS</ENAMEX> regulations as uh as
 	
 	
 		that sounds like it might be a really good idea
 	
 	
 		uh deductions uh allowable deductions for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> they put those in oh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five years ago</TIMEX> uh you know the the different insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> and things started promoting those plans
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh i i think there you know it's a pretty good option to have
 		of course the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">401K 401K</ENAMEX> is is a good you know it's a good savings vehicle
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so uh
 		anyway uh
 		what kind of plans are you are you in now are what have you been in before
 	
 	
 		well
 		i think of uh you mean as far as retirement
 	
 	
 		well as so far as benefit packages indicate in total
 	
 	
 		i think the the most important thing for me right now is is really the medical coverage
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i am in uh
 		in uh involved in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a four 401K</TIMEX> but i'm uh contributing such a such a small amount right now
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		just to go ahead and have the account open because uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh
 		i just let's see i've been with this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about three months</TIMEX> and before that
 		uh we were
 		we're we're still in the process of trying to catch up
 	
 	
 		yeah i understand that yeah
 	
 	
 		we were we were way behind financially and so haven't really uh quite managed to catch up yet
 	
 	
 		yeah so
 	
 	
 		exactly and we're also trying to buy a house which complicates matters even further
 	
 	
 		right yeah it's and it's uh it it's uh uh a hassle trying to to uh
 		uh put your money all in the right in the savings you know in the right pockets i guess it would be a way to say it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know to get everything do you have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and so so they i guess the uh
 	
 	
 		no
 		no that would complicate things even more
 	
 	
 		yeah the yeah the medical insurance would really be a lot more important if you had uh if you had <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> i guess if you're of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> bearing age then it's important too you know because
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah that's probably
 	
 	
 		you know because you got to have uh at least have the coverage in case that your in case you have another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> or have a child
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah that's true
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		
 
 		you want to have that coverage
 		so anyway uh
 		but what else
 	
 	
 		well there's lets see what other
 	
 	
 		yeah uh i guess uh what what kind of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">typical vacation</TIMEX>
 		programs uh vacation plans do do the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> have that you've worked for
 		uh so far as when you get vacation and how much
 	
 	
 		it seems like everybody has it used to be that they used to give like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks a year</TIMEX> and now they give <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one week</TIMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first six months</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah it's i have not uh i have not seen vacation policies you know written in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about seven years</TIMEX> so i'm not real sure how they're how they're changing what they're doing now
 	
 	
 		most most of the time now they do <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first week</TIMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first six months</TIMEX> so that if somebody really needs that time
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		they can go ahead and use it then or they can just wait <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the full year</TIMEX> and then have two
 	
 	
 		yeah but uh yeah that's a good deal
 	
 	
 		so it work it would work either way
 	
 	
 		yeah how what do you what do you find that that they're uh when they change from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks to three weeks</TIMEX> is it <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five years or ten years</TIMEX> or
 	
 	
 		probably <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five years</TIMEX> i think
 	
 	
 		yeah uh
 	
 	
 		or seven
 		uh that's kind of far away
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so that's uh that's a that's a bit of a a wait to get i know that uh
 		in the past i've worked for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> you know where they they had a pretty good uh pretty good plan uh vacation policy you know you got you got the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks  the first year</TIMEX> and then they went up
 	
 	
 		okay um
 		i've got another call coming in
 	
 	
 		oh is that yours okay well and it's been nice talking to you
 	
 	
 		okay all right bye bye
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">okay</ENAMEX> thanks
