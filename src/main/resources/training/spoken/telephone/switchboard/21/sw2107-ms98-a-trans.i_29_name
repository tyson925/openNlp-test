 		oh

 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and it started raining and i was hysterical i was i mean you would have thought a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> had died i called everyone i knew i had every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> i knew in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> searching for this <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> and they laughed at me they thought that was so hysterical
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yes i understand
 		oh no i understand we have uh we've gone through the same thing with ours we've cut you know they've been ill i mean i take off work to take care of my <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> you know the my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boss</ENAMEX> thinks i'm absolutely crazy
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and then we had a baby and its like all right who comes first the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> or the baby
 	
 	
 		right the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> was here first so  i know it's hard
 	
 	
 		and and then when we go to sleep at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> you know it's like uh my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> and i have to try to get any space on the bed because we have all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> of them up there with us it's like all right whose <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">corners</ENAMEX> is this one
 	
 	
 		oh how funny
 		that's sweet i have the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two the other two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> i have are outdoor <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and they didn't used to be actually but they got kind of wild and weren't doing very well inside so i put them outside once i got a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and they're doing great out there they love it but the other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> one i got he doesn't want anything to do with outside unless you're there
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		other than that he gets scared to death if you shut that door he goes into hiding
 	
 	
 		oh no
 	
 	
 		i think it's from the time he jumped off the balcony and lord knows what happened to him
 	
 	
 		yes uh-huh that's it
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but he's probably been through all kinds of nightmares
 	
 	
 		right traumatized for life here
 	
 	
 		probably
 	
 	
 		oh yeah we've all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> of ours are house <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> we started out with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">outdoor cats</ENAMEX> but our <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX> decided he didn't like <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> and shot <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of them
 	
 	
 		are they
 		oh no
 	
 	
 		oh well he lived through it oh i couldn't believe it we went through <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">like twenty two</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">hundred dollars</NUMEX> worth of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vet</ENAMEX> bills the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">the cat almost</ENAMEX> died and but he turned out to be such a wonderful <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat oh</ENAMEX> he loves life now
 	
 	
 		oh my gosh
 		uh
 		i imagine
 	
 	
 		and he's like oh thank you so much
 	
 	
 		i wonder how many of his lives he missed when that happened
 	
 	
 		i know we wondered about that but uh oh that was a traumatic experience for us too
 	
 	
 		oh oh i can imagine what did he shoot him with
 	
 	
 		uh well uh from what we can tell it was a pellet <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">gun</ENAMEX> and then he started chasing him with a bull whip
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh my gosh
 	
 	
 		oh yes it was absolutely nuts uh but uh luckily enough you know we found the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> in time and uh rushed him to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vet</ENAMEX> and it took us about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six weeks</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are crazy
 		oh Lord
 	
 	
 		of in and out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vet</ENAMEX> and surgery

 		oh man
 	
 	
 		
 
 		but oh they he's been a wonderful cat
 	
 	
 		i imagine they usually are after something like that happens to them it just seems to mellow them or something
