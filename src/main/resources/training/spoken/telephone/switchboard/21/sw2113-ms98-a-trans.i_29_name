 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh the last movie that i saw i i don't go to that many so i'll just have to talk about the ones that i went to see but uh it was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Awakenings</ENAMEX> with uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robin Williams</ENAMEX> and uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter DeNiro</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		okay
 		yes uh-huh
 	
 	
 		have you seen it
 	
 	
 		no unfortunately i haven't i heard it's really good but
 	
 	
 		it is i just have to take my hat off to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter DeNiro</ENAMEX> he is one of the best <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actors</ENAMEX> i've ever seen it's
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		there's a point where the uh the show is about these uh catatonic type <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> discovers a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> that brings them back to the the living more or less
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but it wears off and the way it wears off is he goes through all these spastic you know uh it starts off with like a tic and then it gets to where he can't you know control his movements at all
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and it was just so realistic the way you know you have to just keep reminding yourself that he's an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actor</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		though
 	
 	
 		what does um is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robby Robin Williams</ENAMEX> does he have a funny part in the movie or is
 	
 	
 		no it was very serious very serious
 	
 	
 		oh how does he do serious stuff
 	
 	
 		he's good he's he's talented <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> he is
 	
 	
 		yes yes i've only seen him in funny stuff and so
 	
 	
 		i know me too but uh well what was that show um
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Garfield uh Garfield</ENAMEX>
 		i want to say <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Garfield</ENAMEX> but that wasn't
 	
 	
 		yeah uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Garp The World</ENAMEX> of Garp
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The World According to Garp</ENAMEX> he wasn't always funny in that show was he
 	
 	
 		i didn't read see the the movie i read the book but i
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i did too  and that's why i was thinking it couldn't be just a totally funny part but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		yeah in fact it got some pretty serious deep parts in it so
 	
 	
 		yeah right
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		well what have you seen
 	
 	
 		i think the last movie that we went out to see was <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dances With Wolves</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh i saw it
 	
 	
 		uh well good we've both seen one  did you cry through much of
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yes the whole way
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i was telling a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> i i said i only cried twice but each was <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about half an hour</TIMEX> long so
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		where did you cry
 	
 	
 		um let's see when i each time that i thought that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indians</ENAMEX> were going to get killed i cried um i cried the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time when the um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">wagon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> got killed when they attacked him
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		and um i think from there on   through the movie let's see what else did it
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		um
 		what other parts i can't remember any of the other parts right yeah
 	
 	
 		i cried when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horse</ENAMEX> got killed and when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">wolf</ENAMEX> got killed
 	
 	
 		well i don't remember when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horse</ENAMEX> got killed
 	
 	
 		oh they when he was riding back to the settlement and they shot his <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horse</ENAMEX> out from under him
 	
 	
 		oh yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		and then he uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next day</TIMEX> he looked out there and saw those buzzards you know  and that <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">horse</ENAMEX> has been such a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pal</ENAMEX> to him
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 		when he was  alone
 		you can tell i'm an animal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lover</ENAMEX> you can hear my dog
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh unfortunately we don't have any <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> so
 		um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but
 	
 	
 		it was a beautiful story it really was
 	
 	
 		it there was a lot of pretty scenery too in that movie what did you think about the buffalo scenes
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um</ENAMEX>
 		oh i thought it was awful
 	
 	
 		that was
 	
 	
 		and so graphic i mean i hadn't even imagined it you know i think we've all heard the story of the slaughter of the buffalo
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um i had a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> who had fixed some uh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chili buffalo chili</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about a week before</TIMEX> went to see the movie of course they raise them now you know to eat
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh
 		uh-huh yeah that's not
 	
 	
 		but she we were both feeling so guilty about enjoying this chili uh after seeing that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 		yeah well at least you know that it wasn't same situation that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">buffalo</ENAMEX> died in
 	
 	
 		no it wasn't
 	
 	
 		um i thought the scenes when the buffaloes running though were beautiful like that was great and there were so many of them i didn't know that that many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buffaloes</ENAMEX> alive much less in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> place
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		yeah really
 	
 	
 		so that was pretty
 	
 	
 		really and to think about how it just changed the whole landscape you know you could follow this this beaten down path
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and it sounded like thunder and earthquakes and that sort of thing
 	
 	
 		i wonder how they kept up with them though it seemed like the buffaloes were moving so fast i guess they graze though that wouldn't have been a problem
 	
 	
 		i know
 		yeah yeah it uh uh have you seen any of the behind the scenes uh of of that movie
 	
 	
 		no huh-uh
 	
 	
 		it was they tried to keep it you know as very close to real
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i mean like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kevin Costner</ENAMEX> did all of his own scenes and uh they had to teach a wolf how to to howl uh-huh that's the part they had trouble finding was wolves
 	
 	
 		oh
 		i guess they're just not
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">domesticated</ENAMEX> or or
 	
 	
 		yeah right they just don't howl that much anymore
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		i could they could bring them in with my <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> and set a siren off and that's all they'd have to do
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that'll teach them with <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a couple minutes</TIMEX> huh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well that's funny
 	
 	
 		well i think we've made it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh is that <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five minutes</TIMEX> is that
 	
 	
 		i don't know is it <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five or three</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		okay
 		oh i'm not sure
