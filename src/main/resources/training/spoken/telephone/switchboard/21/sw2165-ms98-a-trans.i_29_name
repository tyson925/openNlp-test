 
     		
 	
 		okay i'm a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meat</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">potato</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>  yeah
 	
 	
 		you are huh
 	
 	
 		yeah i love to cook outdoors
 	
 	
 		you barbecue steaks
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">barbecue steaks</ENAMEX> and fry fish
 		but uh no exotic foods although i did order a uh
 		a uh wok that i saw advertised on TV and i'm looking forward to getting that and cooking some <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> food
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		pardon me
 		but uh
 	
 	
 		i think my standard thing when i have <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> and i'm not too brave trying new recipes so a lot of times i will get the grill out
 		and sometimes we do like surf and turf like we'll get some little filets wrap them up with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacon</ENAMEX> and then maybe do some little <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salmon steaks</ENAMEX> at the same time so that's my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>'s deal he's out there you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		with the grill trying to get those things he likes to put sometimes even hickory chips on the barbecue you know get a little different flavor
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and then you do your mashed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">potato</ENAMEX> and your <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salad</ENAMEX> you can't go wrong with that that'll push please pretty much any guest
 	
 	
 		i like to kind of make my own barbecue sauce
 	
 	
 		oh you do
 	
 	
 		yeah i'll take some of the uh thick and rich barbecue <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sauce</ENAMEX> and put a little red <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wine</ENAMEX> in it a little uh uh liquid smoke
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		ooh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		a little soy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sauce</ENAMEX>
 		and uh some uh seasoned <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt mix</ENAMEX> all that up together and put it on the steak
 	
 	
 		um okay
 	
 	
 		tastes pretty good gives it a kind of a hickory flavor
 		but uh grill i have i i don't normally put hickory chips in it but it's got the uh uh rocks
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		in the bottom of it and a lot of times the the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">juice</ENAMEX> from prior <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steaks</ENAMEX> will give it a a good flavor
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 		my only other standard menu i guess is uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thanksgiving</TIMEX>  i know how to put the bird in cook the bird and make all the trimmings
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		oh yeah
 		yeah i can remember the big <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thanksgiving</TIMEX> dinners my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> would make
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well what kind of things do you normally have with it <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have different ideas of what goes with it
 	
 	
 		yeah uh you mean <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thanksgiving</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh i i can make a meal just out of the the uh uh corn <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bread dressing</ENAMEX> and goblet gravy
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		and uh cranberry <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sauce</ENAMEX> i i could eat just that and be satisfied
 	
 	
 		yeah my uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother-in-law</ENAMEX> is into the corn <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bread stuffing</ENAMEX> now i never really had that much
 		before i came to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> but she is always she makes her corn <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bread</ENAMEX> and then of course you know she uses that to to make the stuffing we didn't do that so much uh i'm from kind of like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX> area
 		and uh we're you know not into the corn <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bread</ENAMEX> as much so our stuffing was um lot of times was uh like sausage or what not we would make it with you know varied uh meats like that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		inside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">turkey</ENAMEX> and then of course we always had to have mashed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">potatoes</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and your standard <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetables</ENAMEX> like you always had to have some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peas</ENAMEX> and corn
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peas</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">corn</ENAMEX> and green beans
 		but uh
 	
 	
 		and you got to have your cranberry <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sauce</ENAMEX> now i like jellied kind
 	
 	
 		got to have the cranberry <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sauce</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and you got to have your pumpkin pie
 	
 	
 		so being from the north i guess corn <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bread</ENAMEX> and black eye <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peas</ENAMEX> are strange are strange to you
 	
 	
 		well yeah
 	
 	
 		most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> never from north when we mention having black eye <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peas</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">corn bread</ENAMEX> and green onions
 	
 	
 		yeah and it's funny because <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> call things differently in different areas um
 		my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> grew up a lot in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philadelphia</ENAMEX> area i was very young when we lived there but you call things differently like um uh we called them all hoagies down here they call them submarine sandmiches
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and we didn't ever call it uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cokes</ENAMEX> and such you know we call it soda
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um so it's just different terminology for the same thing
 	
 	
 		different terminology
 		i don't care much for those subs there's too much <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bread</ENAMEX> for me i don't like that much <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bread</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah that's it's a different kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bread</ENAMEX> and it's somewhat of a harder crust it's not the soft
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know kind of uh rolls that they have here it was a harder crust and some of the hoagies were cooked like the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philadelphia</ENAMEX> um steak
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the hoagie</TIMEX> steak that they they sell
 	
 	
 		but uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thanksgiving</TIMEX> i i don't really care that much for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">turkey</ENAMEX>
 		it's too dry for me
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		i'll eat the dark <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meat</ENAMEX> but you can have the white meat
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		that's like eating sandpaper
 	
 	
 		well what is it for um <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">New Year</TIMEX>'s lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> make <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ham</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sauerkraut</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah well also New <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">New Year</TIMEX>'s down here you've got to have black eyed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peas</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		they're supposed to bring you good luck or good or good finances
 	
 	
 		uh i think they cook cabbage up north i think that's one of the things they want i'm not sure i'm not
 	
 	
 		i'll eat it as long as i'm not around while it's being cooked
 	
 	
 		now we always had a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ham</ENAMEX> like on uh uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Easter</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you always have to have a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ham</ENAMEX> or something on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Easter</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah i much prefer <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ham</ENAMEX> than i do <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">turkey</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thanksgiving</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		i think last let me try to think i think the last time we had a big meal like that we did have both i think we did have both on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thanksgiving</TIMEX>  just in case <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> you know have a variety
 	
 	
 		well plus <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ham</ENAMEX>  if you're going to give a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> or something <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ham</ENAMEX>'s always good for one thing you can carve it and eat it with your hands you don't have to have a plate
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but you can just snack on it
 	
 	
 		oh that's true well um you work here at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Expressway</ENAMEX> site
 	
 	
 		i work at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lewisville</ENAMEX> site
 	
 	
 		oh Lewisville  any decent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> in your <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cafeteria</ENAMEX> up there
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		i i've heard <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that uh have come and visited that <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> that uh from other <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> that our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cafeteria</ENAMEX> is head and shoulders above the others
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		yeah that's what i've heard
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		but of course you you know you eat day in and day out at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> particular particular place and i guess you get tired of it or whatever and it doesn't seem like it's
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		as good as as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> say it is
 	
 	
 		hum
 		well i normally work in the north building and um you would think that since you know the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> are there that we would have a pretty good one but
 		i don't know i think it's just kind of standard  like we've got anything while they do cater to the executive dining <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> but i think they give them different food
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i think so too
 		and i i at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lewisville</ENAMEX> i'm not fond of their vegetable selection
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		uh
 		they have as far as i'm concerned because i'm i'm not a big vegetable eater they have too many uh yellow <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetables</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the same day</TIMEX> and
 		it seems seems like it's it's a variety of the same type of vegetable
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		like they'll have uh
 		they'll have broccoli and they'll have squash and cauliflower all on the same day
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		and that that doesn't
 		i'm i like more of a variety than that
 		in fact <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX> they they had they had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> kinds of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">potatoes</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		they had mashed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">potatoes</ENAMEX> they had <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fries</ENAMEX> and they had au gratin
 	
 	
 		now that is a little overdoing it
 	
 	
 		that's overdoing it
 	
 	
 		well my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> he used to complain at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cafeteria</ENAMEX> because it seemed like so many of their different items
 		they always added garlic to it like he would get tuna salad this is what is that and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ingredient</ENAMEX> no matter what you're making garlic
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and he said tuna <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salad</ENAMEX> shouldn't taste garlicky  but everything always seemed to have a garlic flavor to it
 	
 	
 		
  
 		yeah
 		
  
 		yeah and every once in a while they'll have dressing but uh whoever makes it uh goes crazy with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sage</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		
 
 		got to to strong of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sage</ENAMEX> taste to it
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		i usually i can usually find something to eat there even if it's a hamburger
 	
 	
 		well i'm i spend a lot of time over in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Park Central</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but we have just a little <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">deli downstairs</ENAMEX> but in the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">mornings</TIMEX> they make these really good muffins
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		they don't make a lot of them and i don't think they make them at other places this little <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">deli</ENAMEX> is like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RC Cooper</ENAMEX> it's a little place you know it's a little <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> here in town it's real small
 		but uh they make the best muffins we're talking it's a real good size one you know  and they make them different flavors like
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh they have a chocolate chip <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> poppy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seed</ENAMEX> is my favorite  and uh they'll have like a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">banana nut</ENAMEX> and a apple <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> and a zucchini and a blueberry
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		really good they usually pretty much go fast they don't make a lot of them You have to get here <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early in the morning</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah they have muffins there at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> cafeteria too in the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">mornings</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		pretty good
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah they got uh blueberry and
 		i guess it's apple or some kind of a
 		maybe cinnamon cinnamon <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">apple</ENAMEX> it's it's got the cinnamon on top of it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		hum
 	
 	
 		and uh they're pretty good sized too
 		but i usually wind up getting a donut
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		a chocolate donut
 	
 	
 		well you ought to try a muffin if you haven't
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah like i really need the cholesterol
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh well we all indulge right
 	
 	
 		um yep
 		but i love to cook
 		i wish i was a better <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cook</ENAMEX> than i was but i i love to cook
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		i don't like them cleaning up the dishes
 	
 	
 		yeah i know my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> he'll cook every once in a while but like the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen</ENAMEX> is a disaster area afterwards
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		because he has to get everything out and he loves to season i mean he's like he gets every seasoning out of the cupboard you know and uses it and he likes to put lemon
 	
 	
 		yeah
