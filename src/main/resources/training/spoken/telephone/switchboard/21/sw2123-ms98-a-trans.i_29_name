 
     		
 	
 		
 
 		so what kind of eating out do you prefer do you like
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh i don't know uh medium priced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> usually  not anything too nice because we have a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four year</TIMEX> old
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		so i usually like things that cater to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		things that don't cost too much but you get your money's worth
 	
 	
 		yeah and are loud so when he gets loud it's not too it doesn't bother the other people
 	
 	
 		uh-huh but don't don't you
 	
 	
 		lots of fast food too i hate to admit it but
 	
 	
 		yeah but don't don't you like to get away from it all every once in a while and go to a nice quiet restaurant sometime
 	
 	
 		oh yeah yeah then we go to someplace nicer quieter
 	
 	
 		something with uh a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cuisine</ENAMEX> that's a little bit you know more sophisticated like an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX> or something like that
 	
 	
 		um-hum  yeah there's uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biraporetti's</ENAMEX> is one of our favorites it's real nice it's Italian
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it's nice and dark and quiet so it just kind of depends on the occasion
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		what do you like to do
 	
 	
 		well i i personally don't like to go to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> because  i'm <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		
  
 		so that's just like everyday <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> for you huh
 	
 	
 		well not really because you know i live i live here in a dorm i i still go to college but
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		i i kind of don't eat <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> food if unless i go home because my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mom cooks</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> food and it's like you know the you know she i i think that she cooks the best so there's no reason for me to go out and pay enormous sum for something that's just not as good
 	
 	
 		hm
 		yeah hers probably would be the best
 	
 	
 		yeah  but you know i also like the  the fast food places like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taco Bell</ENAMEX> because you can get a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> for cheap prices
 	
 	
 		oh yeah thirty <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">nine cents</NUMEX> or whatever for those little <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tacos</ENAMEX> yeah my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> likes those yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah fifty <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">nine cents</NUMEX> yeah
 		so you knows
 		yeah it's it's something that you know we we go there <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every Sunday</TIMEX>  me and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">roommate</ENAMEX> go there <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every Sunday</TIMEX> you know with our hangover
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> and we go to uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taco Bell</ENAMEX> and get the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tacos</ENAMEX> you know it's something it's it's cheap you don't have to spend a lot of money
 	
 	
 		yeah and it tastes pretty much i mean i like the way it it taste good and it's fast i like that too
 	
 	
 		yeah
