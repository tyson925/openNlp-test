 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay what do you like to cook
 	
 	
 		i like  well i like to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cook</ENAMEX> foods i like to eat i like to eat <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italian</ENAMEX> food best and i find that i that's pretty easy to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cook</ENAMEX> because a lot of it's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dish meals</ENAMEX> type things and they're kind of convenient
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		that'd be good for a dinner <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> that you know to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cook</ENAMEX> that because you don't have to deal with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> different things coming out at once is that what you usually cook when you have a party
 	
 	
 		right
 		um i usually have <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> that are smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> i don't have i've never had a real big dinner <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> except at traditional holidays like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thanksgiving</TIMEX> and such
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and so um yeah uh yeah i guess i usually do i like to cook um heavy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sauces</ENAMEX> and um
 	
 	
 		really
 		that sounds good
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">noodles</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pasta</ENAMEX> and such
 	
 	
 		ooh fattening
 	
 	
 		yeah actually  how about you what do you like to to cook
 	
 	
 		um we it's funny that um we're talking about this we just had a dinner <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> and we had um our senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pastor</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> came over
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i catered to their diet is the only thing though so it wasn't something i really wanted to make i really wanted to make <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">red beans</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX> and with Anduille
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		you you know sausage because i'm from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Orleans</ENAMEX> originally and um i was gonna make that red <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beans</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX> with the those <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cajun</ENAMEX> sausage and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bread</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">garlic butter</ENAMEX> and stuff
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and um  a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salad</ENAMEX> and then for desert i wanted i would i really wanted to make um
 		just brownies or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">French doughnuts</NUMEX> would have been good but it's real hard to make them they don't really come out like they do in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Orleans</ENAMEX> up here i don't know why
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		i don't know if it's me or the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> or the recipe i have but
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">humidity</ENAMEX> or something
 	
 	
 		um that's what i want that's what i like to make is just real neat stuff like that but
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		kind of like the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Italians</ENAMEX> it's really good but instead i catered to their diet so i made baked <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chicken</ENAMEX> in the crock pot and
 		um it was good and everything it had all the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetables</ENAMEX> in it but it seemed kind of boring compared
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		it kind of  kind of down played compared to what you'd like huh do you find yourself um
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		with all the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">um cholesterol</ENAMEX> and and high fiber changing the way that you that you entertain
 	
 	
 		i find it changing the way that i eat but not the way i entertain
 		because i guess i guess i feel like um if they're on a diet like that i'm gonna you know honor that
 		but if it's just another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> came over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">um couple weeks later</TIMEX> and i made what did i make that night i made a roast and i made um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh i can't believe this my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> broke the coffee pot i just bought yesterday
 	
 	
 		oh no
 	
 	
 		i can't believe that anyway but um after when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ricky</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carrie</ENAMEX> came over
 		we made um a pot roast with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gravy</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salad</ENAMEX> and the whole bit and normally i don't eat we don't eat like that during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the week</TIMEX> because of the you know the calories and the fat in it but
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know when we're having <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guests</ENAMEX> we just kind of feel like just do it and i made blueberry cobbler  and we had extra crust with it i mean it was so fattening but i don't think we gained any weight from it so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh that sounds good
 		well  every once in a while i i think i feel the same way when i'm entertaining i don't take that thing into consideration unless it's
 		really really like a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> will turn down <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dessert</ENAMEX> if it's too rich simply because they don't want the extra calories so i think <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dessert</ENAMEX> is the only thing that i kind of down play sometimes
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		right i made a apple pan downy when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pastor</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> came over and she didn't eat it
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		but i did bake <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">apples</ENAMEX> so that it would be not brownies you know i figured there was less calories in apple pan downy than in fudge brownies
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah
 		yeah  yeah
 	
 	
 		so um  i got a good brownie recipe
 	
 	
 		oh that's good
 	
 	
 		but uh anyway so i guess that's about what i do when i entertain
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so do you have anything else you want to say about it or
 	
 	
 		um
 		nothing comes to mind right off so i guess not
 	
 	
 		okay well it was nice talking to you okay bye
 	
 	
 		okay you too  bye-bye
