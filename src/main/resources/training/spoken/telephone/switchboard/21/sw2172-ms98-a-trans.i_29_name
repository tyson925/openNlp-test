 
     		
 	
 		
  
 		okay do you um have a garden
 	
 	
 		um i have several outside <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">shrubs</ENAMEX> that i maintain take care of
 	
 	
 		um-hum do you enjoy working out in the yard
 	
 	
 		yeah i certainly do uh i planted uh a rosebed last year
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh they came out looking really nice lot of red and white ones pink
 	
 	
 		uh-huh i've had some roses out in my backyard too and they've done real well i was surprised
 		i we had some in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX> and they were real hard to keep up with but seems like they like the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> climate better
 	
 	
 		uh
 		yeah yeah as as long as you give it uh good drainage and uh lot of uh oh  some some plant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> once a month
 	
 	
 		right yeah we built up our we built up boxes and put them in that so that they would drain because our soil is so bad
 		where i live do you live in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> or
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm in uh Plano
 	
 	
 		Plano oh yeah i'm out in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rowlett</ENAMEX> and we have that brown <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">clay</ENAMEX> soil  and it's real hard to grow
 		anything here
 	
 	
 		yeah i've got a well my <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">roses</ENAMEX> are on the west side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> i asked my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> what they wanted to see outside their uh front door
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		because it's right by their entryway and they they wanted roses so  that's what i planted
 	
 	
 		oh  that's accommodating
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah and i still need to assess the damage outside from the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">the</NUMEX> freeze <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this winter</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i've got quite a few dead shrubs some  and oleander
 	
 	
 		right we've got a few things too it's hard to tell if they'll come back or not
 	
 	
 		yeah the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> are all doing really well i've got a nice <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Japanese</ENAMEX> maple out front that uh
 		looking really nice right now
 	
 	
 		well that's good we
 		we planted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">pecan trees</ENAMEX> out front and every one of them died i told my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> this is the last <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> if it dies we're going to something else
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but we dug a hole <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about six</NUMEX> times as big as it needs to be and filled it with all kinds of compost and
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pine</ENAMEX> needles and everything else we could think of hopefully it'll drain this year
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every year</TIMEX> uh there's some freeze damage and i lose different uh variety of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">shrubs</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		have to go replace them with uh something a little hardier
 	
 	
 		yeah it's hard to find something that'll take the heat as well as the freezing
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		that we get down here i have a few little <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> i <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> around the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> out front i've enjoyed
 		doing those i put uh pansies out in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the winter</TIMEX> and
 		they pretty much last <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all winter</TIMEX> and then i put uh moss rose out in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX> and it just goes crazy you don't really have to do anything to it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		puts a lot of color out there
 	
 	
 		yeah i don't do much with <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> myself i just get a lot of evergreen evergreen type shrubs some uh
 	
 	
 		all year
 		right
 	
 	
 		some uh dwarf <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Burford</ENAMEX> hollies and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yaupon</ENAMEX> hollies
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		those do pretty well here don't they
 	
 	
 		they do very well um-hum
 	
 	
 		we've got my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> put a little row of those out in the backyard to kind of
 		make a little cut so that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> wouldn't come marching through the yard and everything
 	
 	
 		yeah they make a nice hedge uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and the nice thing about those types of hollies is you don't have to trim them uh into a boxy type hedge
 		you can just let them uh grow their natural uh shape
 	
 	
 		right yeah the only thing i don't like about them is weeding around them because they get so sharp
 		pricky things get in your hands
 	
 	
 		oh yeah oh i've got some <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> Hollies that are just outrageous
 		they they are very sharp
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		do you do your own uh lawn maintenance or do you hire somebody to uh to do that
 	
 	
 		yeah we do it my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> does most of the mowing and edging and all that stuff
 	
 	
 		yeah i do that myself too i i really don't appreciate them calling me up all the time to try to push their services on me
 	
 	
 		yeah we get something on the door about every week
 	
 	
 		because i've got a very small yard the entire size of the lot is only <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">forty five</NUMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ninety</NUMEX> feet
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it's what they call low maintenance <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">yard</ENAMEX> and these uh uh maintenance uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> call up wanting to uh
 		uh put put the uh weed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">killer</ENAMEX> and the fertilizer down and they want they want to charge <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">forty</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">forty five dollars</NUMEX> per application for my size yard i i don't spend that much in a year
 	
 	
 		yeah really
 		oh our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX> has a lawn service come and do his and i don't think it looks any better than what my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> does so
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i'm not really tempted to do that either
 		if
 	
 	
 		it doesn't take much work
 	
 	
 		yeah i can mow the backyard but there's something about the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">grass</ENAMEX> in our front yard is so dense
 	
 	
 		huh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		that the mower <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">wheels</ENAMEX> just kind of bog down in there and i can not push it
 	
 	
 		yeah i've got a little electric mower and i i will never buy another one of those again
 	
 	
 		oh
 		really
 	
 	
 		it's fine for my size yard but uh it really doesn't have the power of a gas motor
 	
 	
 		huh
 		i would like a self-propelled <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> i think
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		that might make it easier
 	
 	
 		it's better for for a large yard
 	
 	
 		yeah ours is not that big but like i said if i had to mow the front i'd be stuck because i can't get it to move
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		before i moved down here when i was up uh north in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wisconsin</ENAMEX> living with my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX> they lived on uh <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">three and a half acres</NUMEX> of land and uh we started mowing that with a push mower
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		uh they finally got smart and got a riding lawn mower which was a big improvement for for us  us <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> who had to go out there and uh mow the the grass every <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every week</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh i'm sure
 		yeah that's a pretty large area
 	
 	
 		it it still took <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a few hours</TIMEX> even with the riding mower
 	
 	
 		really
 		did <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> up there edge as pri as strictly and stuff as they do down here
 	
 	
 		um not nearly as much as here
 		uh i think it's probably because we lived out in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> somewhat and uh there just wasn't the emphasis on keeping the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">yards</ENAMEX> looking real nice
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i lived in a town it was a college <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX> and i mean <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> kept their <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">lawns</ENAMEX> mowed but they sure didn't get into like they do here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>
 		wasn't a source of pride or something like it is down here
 	
 	
 		yeah a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> do but then again there are a lot who do nothing
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> uh is
 		kind of in between there are a couple of uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> who are are really good about planting <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> and trees
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but there the majority really haven't done anything with their yards this neighborhood is is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four years old</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and you would think that uh in that time they'd uh get their <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">lawns</ENAMEX> and and gardens established
 	
 	
 		yeah it's hard i know we tried to do our landscaping out front my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>
 		tilled it up in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fall</TIMEX> and then we've been waiting on some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> supposed to be getting us some edging for like <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> cents a foot instead of a bout a dollar
 		and uh he has never got it to us so it just sits out there kind of dug up and doesn't look too good so i can't say anything about anybody else's
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah i'd like to see the the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> put some <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> in the front <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">yards</ENAMEX> anyway just to get something started
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		it'd seem like they'd want to just to uh get some shade and keep their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> a little bit cooler in the summer
 	
 	
 		right
 		you'd think that that would be the first thing they would do as far as the yard goes is to plant a tree
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		it's nice when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">builders</ENAMEX> plant <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> for you when when they build the house
 	
 	
 		yeah did they not put any in in your neighborhood
 	
 	
 		no uh my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">builder</ENAMEX> was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gemcraft</ENAMEX> and they didn't put uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> in at all
 	
 	
 		we had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> in the front of our yard and then one of them died and so that's where we keep putting that pecan
 		keeps dying we have uh i think it's a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Silver Leaf Maple</ENAMEX> or something like that that's hung on out there
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		the trouble with with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">builders</ENAMEX> planting the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> is they they get the weaker varieties ones that aren't as desirable
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and uh those include <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arizona Ash</ENAMEX> and in some cases silver maples
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		hope ours continues to live it's been there <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about four</NUMEX> i guess almost <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four years</TIMEX> now so maybe it's established established enough that it'll go on and survive
 	
 	
 		yeah that's probably true i've got a live <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">oak</ENAMEX> in front uh i i really like the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">oaks</ENAMEX> a lot
 	
 	
 		i like an oak <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">oak trees</ENAMEX> yeah
 	
 	
 		they're very hardy for this area
 	
 	
 		my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">um husband</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> has a place out in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East Texas</ENAMEX> so he's always digging up little
 		red <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">oaks</ENAMEX> and things like that and trying to bring them back and start them but
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so far we haven't had much luck
 	
 	
 		oh i had a red oak <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few years ago</TIMEX> that i bought from uh
 		from a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> who sold <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> off the back of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trailer</ENAMEX>  and that was a mistake for uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">well two</NUMEX> reasons one thing it wasn't insured
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and the other reason was that i bought it in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">spring</TIMEX> and it was a balled and bur lapped <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> uh right before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> the heat of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> it couldn't uh take the heat and it died
 	
 	
 		oh
 		yeah well that's too bad
 		we've got all of our <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Calloway</ENAMEX>'s and luckily they'll take them back any time for any reason if they die
 	
 	
 		yeah i usually go to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Callaway</ENAMEX>'s or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wolfe</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Callaway</ENAMEX>'s tends to have nicer <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">shrubs</ENAMEX> uh more fully developed
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh i don't think there's a problem with the warranty on any of those places although they have cut back on their uh warranty for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">shrubs</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past couple of years</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah i know the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolfe</ENAMEX> told us they cut back on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> warranty like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six months</TIMEX> or less
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Calloway</ENAMEX>'s has kept theirs forever so
 	
 	
 		really well that's good for <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> i don't think they do that for <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">shrubs</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i don't know we haven't bought
 	
 	
 		i think it's still <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year or less</TIMEX> for uh for <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">shrubs</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh-huh we haven't bought any <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">shrubs shrubs</ENAMEX> yet hopefully
 		i think we've almost waited this too late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> now to start putting in anything of any size
 	
 	
 		oh it's never too late to plant something unless unless well for <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> if they're balled and bur lapped it's recommended to plant them in the fall or winter
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but for uh just <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">shrubs</ENAMEX> say <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">five gallon or one gallon</NUMEX> shrubs any time of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> is fine
 	
 	
 		oh really it wouldn't matter if we plant them when it was starting to get warmer
 	
 	
 		right just have to take care of them and water them uh so they get established put some uh uh some uh
 		uh
 	
 	
 		root stimulator yeah
 	
 	
 		right right some uh stimulator down
 		so uh yeah it's never a problem to plant things in the summer
 	
 	
 		oh well that's good to know maybe there's still hope for our front yard <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this summer</TIMEX> then
 	
 	
 		i'm just waiting for a sale
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		they haven't really had any good sales on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> yet
 	
 	
 		yeah i've i've noticed that they haven't had anything great
 	
 	
 		so
 		but once they uh drop the prices a little bit i'll be out there uh picking up a few more <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">shrubs</ENAMEX> to fill in where we're  where my dead <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">shrubs</ENAMEX> are right now i haven't even pulled them out of the ground yet
 	
 	
 		right yeah
 		yeah <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> we thought some were dead and finally they started leafing out again at the bottom so we just cut them way back and and was able to save them but <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> they look even worse
 	
 	
 		you have to watch the like the crepe myrtles
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		because they'll look really bad like they're dead
 		and all of a sudden they'll bud out
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i've got several crepe myrtles that look just awful
 		and uh there are <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">buds</ENAMEX> coming out all over the place now
 	
 	
 		huh ours haven't done anything yet this year
 	
 	
 		i have a crepe <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">myrtle tree</ENAMEX> in the backyard that still hasn't done anything and i'm kind of wondering what kind of shape it's in right now
 	
 	
 		yeah i like crepe myrtles they really add a lot of color
 	
 	
 		have to make sure they don't get out of hand
 	
 	
 		in the summer
 		oh we haven't had that problem yet they're pretty ours are pretty small
 	
 	
 		they they can
 		tight they can get out of control
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		but mine keep dying back down to the ground so i haven't had that problem yet
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but i do have some really nice <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX> ivy on the west side of the house
 	
 	
 		oh
 		does it grow along a fence or something
 	
 	
 		grows on the on the brick
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> itself
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		that you have to really watch uh to uh keep it under control because they will take over a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> if you don't uh tend to it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh those things grow <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about an inch</NUMEX> a day
