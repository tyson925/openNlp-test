 
     		
 	
 		
 
 		well  i was just looking around my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and thinking about the painting that i've done
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and the last time that um we tackled it i did the kitchen
 		and i had gone through a period of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">depression</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time and painted everything a dark it was called a sassafras it was kind of an orangish brown
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		it was not real pretty anyway so the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">kitchen</ENAMEX> was one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> that got hit with that color
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh i see
 	
 	
 		i tried to cover it with white and it was quite a a feat getting that dark color
 		covered and then just the hassles getting around the cabinets and know if i look underneath my cabinets i'm not satisfied with the jobs i i did on it because there're splotches
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but i'm glad it's done because it's brighter
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah that's for sure
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well we uh i just got married <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about six months ago</TIMEX> and we bought a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> at the same time so we're i'm sitting here in my forty year old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and we're about halfway through the painting process
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh lord
 	
 	
 		so uh
 		the only uh i guess the the big discussion just kind of what you were mentioning has been the color we ended up with our our living and dining <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> are now uh
 		kind of a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a light</NUMEX> peach color with uh and it's got all the old original hardwood trim and stuff so we've got the trim in kind of uh kind of an off-white
 		and this is really the first uh interior painting project that i've attacked  and it's it's been uh
 		it's been something else  to say the least we we had the same type of situation uh the walls were uh
 		uh well they weren't the color difference wasn't so bad but uh there was semigloss underneath
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and we put a flat over the top and everywhere you'd miss there'd be this little bright spot you could see  it seems like you could see it through <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about three</NUMEX> layers of paint
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		every time the sun would come up in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX> i'd see another spot and have to drag out the paint can but uh we've learned we're we uh
 		we worked we've worked our way back into the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hallway</ENAMEX> and and we're in the middle of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bathroom</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">now</TIMEX> but uh it's it's been quite an adventure
 		the other the other thing that makes it uh a little more difficult we've got all hardwood floors and uh
 		we we've learned to be a little more careful about covering up the floors since the since the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time we spent a lot of time on the floor with a tooth toothbrush and what not cleaning up
 	
 	
 		so what are you going to get it off with if you get it on and it's dried
 	
 	
 		well it's it's not too bad it it uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floors</ENAMEX> are finished with a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">polyurethane</ENAMEX> and it's really not to bad to get off it it we're just using latex and it's not too bad to get it off once it's dried even it it it uh comes off with like a
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		a mild abrasive pad like a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scotchbrite</ENAMEX> pad or something like that and water and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">soap</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> so we got pretty lucky on that
 	
 	
 		and it's not scratching your <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX> because it's so thick oh that's pretty good we painted every <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX> some of them like <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two three</NUMEX> times we have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		no not really
 		but
 		okay yeah
 	
 	
 		and they just
 		they ruin
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it's just terrible what they do and then i have been coloring my hair and i'm real haphazard when i do it so i've got dye on my bathroom door
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh gosh
 	
 	
 		and i haven't figured out how to get that off i guess i'll have to take that door down and really get it good
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah probably so
 	
 	
 		and then we have a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> story we did the outside of it <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one summer</TIMEX> that was horrendous i mean i i couldn't stand the back side going up that high on the ladder i could get up on the roof and do that
 	
 	
 		okay
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but i dread that the next time
 	
 	
 		yeah i
 		we uh our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> was painted as part of the purchase contract so we didn't have to mess with that this time but i've
 		i i grew up on a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">farm</ENAMEX> so i i've i've messed with outdoor painting a little bit uh but most of that it was done with a sprayer and uh up in the bucket of a loader <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">tractor</ENAMEX> or something like that so it
 		took a lot of the hassle out and then they're we're not you know you're not nearly as concerned with a barn or a granary or something like that as you would be with your own house
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		no i wouldn't think so have you <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> tackled your ceilings yet
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh a little bit yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		oh we got to do that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this summer</TIMEX> we're dreading it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it's like they're dark everything else is white
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh gosh yeah just just the opposite of what everybody's uh working towards now
 	
 	
 		now have you thought about this that wherever you buy your paint you need to make sure that that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX>'s not likely to go out of business
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah absolutely  yeah we uh we stocked up the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time around but we've definitely got all the formulas on file and uh
 		we're they'll be there for a while we're we're pretty comfortable with that but yeah it it i'm i'm real nervous every time i i open a new can i'm wondering if i shouldn't
 		buy <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about twenty gallons</NUMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time and keep it all in a in a wash tub or something somewhere because i'm always i'm always afraid that the next coat is not going to match
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but uh it's gone pretty well it just it it takes it takes some time my problem is while
 		i'm not overly proud of it but i'm a self-proclaimed proclaimed perfectionist and it it takes me a long time to do trim and things like that
 		and i'll find i'll find something as i'm going along something not related like like uh i've gone about changing out all the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outlets</ENAMEX> and switches because they they really didn't match
 		they were a few of them were broken and things like that so i always pick up these little extra tasks as i'm doing this and and the painting actually takes probably uh a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> of the time
 		and i i'm always doing all this other stuff and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>'s hollering at me and wondering what else i've come home with from work this time to to put in a ceiling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fan</ENAMEX> or something strange like that
 		so uh it it it always it it it gets you to look at everything real hard when you you start putting a coat of paint on everything you start to notice where all the dents and scratches and things are everywhere
 	
 	
 		oh but i still feel good <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the minute</TIMEX> i put that paint on even if it has got a dent in it i do
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah it sure makes a difference
 	
 	
 		oh what what else can i tell you about painting oh and i get it all in my hair too do you do that
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		spots in it
 	
 	
 		yeah it's it's been uh we we bought this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> with the idea that we were going to spend you know spend a lot of time working on it and uh it was part you know part of the excitement was was getting a good deal on an older <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> it just
 		it really hadn't been taken care of very well it it was actually it was rented out for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of years</TIMEX> and things like that so we uh we ended up getting a fairly good deal on it but uh there just isn't enough time i i've
 		i find myself going to work knowing that that there's a job <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about half</NUMEX> done at home and i really if i would if i'd just stay home and finish it i'd feel a lot better but uh
 		i'm i'm starting to learn that there's always something else so that you could  once you get done you can always start over and and you make up all kinds of excuses so uh
 	
 	
 		are you having to repair the walls at all
 	
 	
 		uh not a whole lot it they're they're in pretty good condition um
 		as as far as uh major repairs you know lot a lot of little filling holes and nicks and things like that but uh the only the most major things have been uh oh
 		i guess i i moved a couple of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outlets</ENAMEX> and or uh switches i should say they for some reason they put a bathroom light switch in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hallway</ENAMEX> and uh yeah and i i didn't like that very well so i i moved that but uh
 	
 	
 		um that's smart
 	
 	
 		most of it most of it's in pretty good shape
 	
 	
 		so where do you live
 	
 	
 		uh live in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		cause i'm in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Garland</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		okay okay
 	
 	
 		could you try to call this weekend
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		to that switchboard did you keep getting that it was down
 	
 	
 		no no i haven't uh i hadn't tried in fact we were we were planting <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this weekend</TIMEX> so uh i was pretty tied up
 	
 	
 		you didn't
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but
 	
 	
 		well i've never tried any other kinds of painting besides on a
 		surface like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX> like to paint a picture or anything i don't know i can't think of anything else to say about painting
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		no that uh that's
 	
 	
 		it hurts your back and it hurts your arm
 	
 	
 		yeah you know it i get a sore i get a sore neck from looking up all the time yeah things like that but uh no that pretty much covers my experiences
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		but you're glad you're doing it right
 	
 	
 		oh yeah most definitely it it just it makes such a difference like i like i say the the overall appearance of this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> is what really devalued it so much uh
 		i you know i don't want to put a price on it but i just feel like we're every <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">every gallon</NUMEX> of paint adds a tremendous amount of value to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> you know every every time i do something a aside from that it just makes me feel a whole lot better to come home and
 		you know old the walls are clean and they match and all those kinds of things
 	
 	
 		uh-huh do you have one of those straight edge things to put underneath when you're doing the baseboards
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah we do it uh
 		it sometimes works and it sometimes doesn't it's
 		i uh when i start doing trim i i've gotten to where i i tend to freehand it because there there's so many layers of paint on this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">forty years</TIMEX> that uh it it's so hard to tell where an edge is anymore and uh
 	
 	
 		on your baseboards
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah they
 	
 	
 		you don't have any carpet down in your house
 	
 	
 		no there's no carpet in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> right now
 	
 	
 		see we've got carpet and
 		i haven't figured out how you're supposed to paint it on down so that you won't see where you stopped off and still not get it on the carpet because every time you move that edger then it gets the carpet into it
 	
 	
 		um okay
 		well you know um
 	
 	
 		you can't hold it there until it's dried
 	
 	
 		yeah i i've  i've seen uh they're they make some plastic edging stuff that comes in like <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> foot lengths
 		and you can uh you can tape them together and and and put
