 
     		
 	
 		what what is do you have a favorite recipe
 	
 	
 		okay okay
 		um yeah that's what it said to discuss some maybe a recipe well it says why would you what you would have for a dinner party um this is strange because i pressed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> and i thought it said begin
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		okay maybe maybe we're all set okay we'll talk for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five minutes</TIMEX> they interrupt at the end um yeah it says what you would have for a dinner party i just happen to plan one out for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> i'll tell you what i'm going to have um
 	
 	
 		oh that's wonderful okay
 	
 	
 		i can find it well i have this new fondue pot and i was going to do basic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cheese</ENAMEX> fondue
 		and i have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different kinds of breads and some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ham</ENAMEX> and i was going to try something weird which you know when you have <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish au gratin</ENAMEX> i was going to make some uh like
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish chunks</ENAMEX> and dip it in the fondue i don't know if it will come out
 	
 	
 		that's what kind of fondue the cheese dip or
 	
 	
 		yeah the cheese fondue i make some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Swiss</ENAMEX> um i prefer cheddar and i'll mix i won't make i won't have a sharp cheddar because
 		for fondue i think it should be a little calmer than real sharp cheddar and then i was going to make other things like potato skins
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah
 		oh that sounds good
 	
 	
 		it see you don't necessarily have to dip this stuff and um i was going to have broccoli and cauliflower for a a vegetable
 	
 	
 		that's always a good thing vegetable trays always go over so well because i think <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> get tired of eating junk i mean i think they like to have healthy stuff too you know it's
 	
 	
 		oh yeah it's amazing how <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetables</ENAMEX> trays will go at a party
 	
 	
 		oh definitely i think better even than than other kinds of food
 	
 	
 		uh
 		yeah instead of something greasy or
 	
 	
 		right exactly yeah
 	
 	
 		uh uh no um my uh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">girlfriend</ENAMEX>'s do catering and they always about every <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> they do is they have a vegetable tray i think they try and suggest it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		what i've been doing when i get invited someplace and bring something i make uh food kebabs You take little toothpicks and cut up uh pineapple and strawberry
 	
 	
 		oh
 		yes
 	
 	
 		even <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">banana</ENAMEX> if you can do it just before you leave it stays nice and fresh
 	
 	
 		right
 		right that's true or even have you ever seen where they they'll take a watermelon and just cut the top out of it and then hollow that out and then put the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX> in the watermelon that is really neat i beat yep
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i like those  um they they made a couple of those uh they made <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> for my uh bridal shower and i was pretty pleased i never made <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> for myself though but they look easy enough to make it's not
 	
 	
 		oh i think it would it would be a lot of work but um you know because it's you know you have to cut each thing or you know use the melon baler and stuff but but i think they're really neat and you know i think they're worth the time
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah you probably get this probably pretty sticky after you get done then you've got to drain the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> out of the watermelon because you know when you scrape it it makes the water
 	
 	
 		because they
 		oh yeah
 		right yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah um something i do is a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX> is i'll get um make <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chocolate sauce</ENAMEX> and dip <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">strawberries</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bananas</ENAMEX> in them
 		yeah i have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> nieces and they they they go melt some chocolate chips  go buy me some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">strawberries</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		is that is that good you know i've seen that so many times <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">strawberries</ENAMEX> dipped in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chocolate</ENAMEX> but i've never tried it are they really good
 	
 	
 		yeah they're you know if you get a sweet <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">strawberry</ENAMEX> they're much better but if you get a sour strawberry
 	
 	
 		oh i bet it doesn't mix well does it
 	
 	
 		huh yeah no they um the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">strawberries</ENAMEX> are coming in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">now</TIMEX> from they're they're coming up from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> of course i live in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vermont</ENAMEX> so
 		but they're really reasonably priced they're coming up from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> so
 	
 	
 		oh well that's good because i know they've been really expensive lately because they weren't in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX> of course they had to be be uh grown in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">greenhouses</ENAMEX> and stuff and in
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i think the uh actually i think they get um some of them from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South America</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh is that right
 	
 	
 		yep they a lot of um of a um <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">produce</ENAMEX> comes from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South America</ENAMEX> of course their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seasons</TIMEX> are switched
 	
 	
 		oh i guess i didn't really
 		uh-huh right
 	
 	
 		so um do you want to discuss your recipe i have a recipe if you want  um it filled
 	
 	
 		well
 		okay sure sure
 	
 	
 		a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> try to stay away from this but i make my own homemade <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pudding</ENAMEX> just because i don't like <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">box</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pudding</ENAMEX> yeah it and it if you um well first of all i
 	
 	
 		is that right i've never heard of that
 	
 	
 		take <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about a quarter and a half</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk</ENAMEX> and i put it in a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> quart saucepan and you put it on <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a really</TIMEX> low heat
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and you want to use one of your good <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sauce pans</ENAMEX> that dissipate the heat because it it ends up burning
 		i mean no matter how careful you are you still might get a film on the bottom of the pot i don't let that worry me and i get the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk lukewarm</ENAMEX> and then i pour <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about a half a cup</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cornstarch</ENAMEX> in it and i have this thing it's called the slender blender
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it it makes the uh it makes uh a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whip</ENAMEX> topping out of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk</ENAMEX> if you get the milk cold enough it's uh i don't know they're called moogoo leaves or something they're
 	
 	
 		i think i know what you're talking is it like a hand held thing yeah okay
 	
 	
 		yeah they're real neat i think they're real reasonably priced some of them they used to be a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">hundred dollars</NUMEX> and they used to whip skim <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk</ENAMEX> into a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dessert</ENAMEX> but i didn't get that one i got the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Black</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Decker</ENAMEX> kind but uh
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		it's real handy because it doesn't have a cord and you beat this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cornstarch</ENAMEX> right into the milk the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk</ENAMEX> you know and it does an excellent job or just hand beat it i guess you could use a hand mixer but
 		i don't think it pure i don't think it gets it good enough and then before the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk</ENAMEX> gets too hot um i add <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> beaten <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX> and i really mix them in good and then <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about a half a cup</NUMEX> of sugar
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i let it pretty much i beat it like every <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minute</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about ten seconds</TIMEX> and it's it starts thickening when it thickens the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cornstarch</ENAMEX> might get a little
 		i don't know it gets like little globs of this rubbery <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cornstarch</ENAMEX> and you just keep beating it in and it's the the trick is is to have this blender
 	
 	
 		oh huh
 	
 	
 		so if you were you'd have to probably almost go out and someone who's just going to make it <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time it's you'll have much better luck if you had one of these little blenders
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		and then you can add <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocoa powder</ENAMEX> to it to make <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chocolate</ENAMEX> or after it's thickened i cook it for a good once it starts boiling i just i cook it for a good <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">seven minutes</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">ten minutes</TIMEX> and then you can make <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chocolate</ENAMEX> or you can take it off
 		and when it cools a little you put um really good vanilla favoring in it and some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">butter</ENAMEX> and that makes <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> vanilla um custard
 	
 	
 		oh wow that is really interesting are you saying to use like um for chocolate like unsweetened unsweetened
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chocolate powder yeah</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocoa</ENAMEX> yeah the unsweetened it comes in like a real dark can our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> used to use it and then
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right i have some  i just want
 	
 	
 		yeah we all used to yeah it's the unsweetened kind it's not like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nestle Quik i</ENAMEX> suppose you could use that i yeah but um
 	
 	
 		right okay cooking chocolate
 		that's really interesting i've never heard of anybody making their own <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pudding</ENAMEX> before that's really neat
 	
 	
 		i
 		well i used to make the regular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pudding the chocolate</ENAMEX> and put it in the pie shell
 		and if it would sit in the refrigerator for a day where you cut the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pie</ENAMEX> it would soak into the pie shell and it was like red and i'm like oh this is kind of groedy
 	
 	
 		well how did you get a recipe for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pudding</ENAMEX> on your own
 	
 	
 		um no actually i found it in one of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>'s um homemade cookbooks i mean something she had collected out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Woman</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Day</TIMEX> or something
 	
 	
 		is that right
 		oh neat that is just really neat because i
 	
 	
 		so
 		i think you couldn't make it with a hand whisk or or a regular beater but um
 	
 	
 		it would probably be a lot more work and probably not turn out as good
 	
 	
 		yeah but i still think a beater would do it good enough um the trick is to get the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cornstarch</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um yeah right in the in the lukewarm milk sometimes i put the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cornstarch</ENAMEX> in a separate bowl and i would put it in the sink and i'll take my lukewarm <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk</ENAMEX> and put it in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cornstarch</ENAMEX>
 		and beat it good it seems to be better than putting the the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cornstarch</ENAMEX> into the liquid it once it hits the top of the liquid it seems to make little balls and stuff on the top
 	
 	
 		so you put the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cornstarch</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah and i'll do this uh sometimes i'll put my after I
 		pour that into my back into my saucepan i'll put the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX> in the same dish and beat them up and then pour the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cornstarch</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk</ENAMEX> mixture in the egg so
 	
 	
 		and then put that back in the saucepan
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">yep</ENAMEX> and then you know if you can put your <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocoa</ENAMEX> in with your <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cornstarch</ENAMEX> if you wanted to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocoa</ENAMEX> even seems to thicken it even more
 	
 	
 		huh that's
 	
 	
 		because by the vanilla doesn't seem to thicken as well as the sometimes the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocoa</ENAMEX> is like my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> really likes it thick he says i can stick the spoon right in this
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		because i'm always worrying it won't firm up because it when you take it out of the saucepan it's like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> i hope this thickens a little more because it's not like real
 		package thick you know when you cook a package it's it's a little less
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but i put it in a nice glass bowl and um some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> don't like that that film on the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pudding</ENAMEX> so you can put uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Saran Wrap</ENAMEX> over the top
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and then once the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pudding</ENAMEX> starts cooling it makes little balls of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Saran Wrap</ENAMEX> so when you pull the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Saran Wrap</ENAMEX> back you sort of should be a little careful pull it back and shake the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> off the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Saran Wrap</ENAMEX> and i might put it back on but um
 	
 	
 		do you do you put it in the refrigerator then or you
 	
 	
 		yeah after well when it starts steaming a lot uh i definitely yeah put it in the refrigerator
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but um i my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> always told me if you put hot <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> in your refrigerator you're going to make it work too hard that's yeah so  that's why i do that
 	
 	
 		right that's true i knew that yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		so well i don't know that's my my great hard recipe
