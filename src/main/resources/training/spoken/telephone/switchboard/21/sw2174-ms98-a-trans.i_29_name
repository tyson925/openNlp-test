 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
 
 		so uh how's the weather by you
 	
 	
 		if it had rained any more in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last two weeks</TIMEX> instead of planting <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">Saint Augustine grass</ENAMEX> in the front yard i think i would have
 		plowed everything under and had a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX> field
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i i heard that it's been raining down there a little bit but it's really been that bad
 	
 	
 		it's so bad wanted to mow <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> i was off and i wanted to mow the yard but just walking across it it's still so mushy if i took a mower out there i'd tear the sod up so bad
 	
 	
 		really that bad huh
 		is it is it typically this rainy i don't think it's typically this rainy by you down there is it
 	
 	
 		it's steady but it's not in the amounts that we been getting normally we get an inch here and then
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a week or so</TIMEX> will pass and you pick up another <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">inch inch and a half</NUMEX>
 		we're getting hit by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three and four</NUMEX> inch bursts at a time
 	
 	
 		oh God i guess you're getting all of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>'s rain
 	
 	
 		well that's where the front had came come from they said it came out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pacific</ENAMEX> run across <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> who was really needing the rain it should've it should've stalled over them for a couple more days
 	
 	
 		right
 		oh they're getting another one later in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the week</TIMEX> there
 		there was another one that was another storm um that was supposed to hit them like on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> or something
 		so i suspect it'll it'll wind it's way to you afterward
 		it's not a pleasant thought
 		so
 	
 	
 		well maybe i maybe i can get the yard mowed before it hits
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well well i can uh i can understand that weather we're having uh
 		we are it we had a late um um an ice storm here
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about two weeks ago</TIMEX> which is you know um and and it's and it's they're calling it the worst ice storm in like the last <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">hundred years</TIMEX>
 		and um and then to the point where <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about three hundred thousand</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in our in our area lost power
 	
 	
 		isn't it a little late in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the season</TIMEX> for that type of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> storm though
 	
 	
 		and
 		yeah oh yeah this is this is um well yeah up here in in in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rochester</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> usually doesn't you know spring comes about this time <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX>
 		and um this was sort of unexpected it had actually been pretty fairly nice you know in the in the forties and um
 		it had even been in the uh in the in the low fifties <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of days in a row</TIMEX> and then they actually they predicted it they said well we're going to have an ice storm coming up and then no one knew how bad it was going to be
 		and it came in and in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one night</TIMEX> it basically destroyed
 		it destroyed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately one third</NUMEX> of all the vegetation in um in like the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">county</ENAMEX> area by us
 		and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about half</NUMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> owned <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rochester</ENAMEX> are destroyed
 		um we had i uh um my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> and i own our own home and we have a very big willow <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> in our backyard
 		that um that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">ninety percent</NUMEX> of which came down in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one night</TIMEX>
 		things like that it was a it it definitely is very um
 		it was it was it wasn't supposed to be as bad they they have i i guess apparently you know ice storms here occasionally but never anything <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this bad this late in the season</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah i'd seen the storm you were talking about when it hit um up around the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX> area
 		uh they had a
 		little film clip about how bad it was up there and i just could not believe how much <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> that thing was carrying with it
 	
 	
 		oh yeah it was it was utterly amazing i mean we we would um we got up in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX> you know um we didn't we you you didn't sleep very well because every all all around you there were crashing sounds and
 		and there were sounds of things breaking and you know you look you know we at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> point we woke up to the sound of the uh the electric lines being ripped off our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and
 		and things like that and then you go outside and everything is covered in ice i mean um you're talking about the lawn before being too mushy to mow
 		um in our case it was just the opposite i mean the lawn was just a solid sheet of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> each blade of grass had a small individual covering of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> you know um
 		maybe you know <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two or three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">millimeters</ENAMEX> thick but thick enough that you could actually see it my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> was covered completely in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> it was in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about a half inch</NUMEX> thick at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> point
 	
 	
 		how do you thaw one out after it's been coated like that i've always lived down in this part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> and i'm not used you know we had an ice storm or a sleet
 	
 	
 		well it
 	
 	
 		and a good freeze and the windshield ices over and you take hot water or warm <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> out of the tap and thaw your windshield
 	
 	
 		yeah um actually it turned out in our case um i know somebody who when they tried to defrost their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> cracked their windshield um
 		though occasionally it can be dethawed in our case we didn't um
 		we didn't have the problem because my we keep my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garage</ENAMEX>
 		so her <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> didn't get iced over you know it wasn't um
 		um it was a little bit cold in her <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX> but it wasn't iced over so i just left my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> out there for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of days</TIMEX> and um within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two or three days</TIMEX> it was it was actually warm enough that everything melted
 		um it was it was actually one of the most beautiful sights i've ever seen
 		because everything looks you know if you can imagine just seeing everything coated in a nice clean sheet of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> and and and it looks really nice the whole whole place but um
 		it got you know after the initial storm it got worse as things started to melt because um as things melted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branches</ENAMEX> shifted and started to fall again
 		so we're still cleaning up we actually left the last <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> got power i guess yesterday
 		and we left the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of emergency <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">last night</TIMEX> or something at like <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midnight</TIMEX>
 		so it's it's it's not fun
 	
 	
 		just hearing what it does to the lawn i hate to even guess what the road conditions would be like in something like that
 	
 	
 		strangely enough the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX> weren't that the the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX> themselves were okay um there wasn't
 		given that um sort of things hit and and for some reason i don't i don't quite understand why they maybe the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> didn't have anything to grab onto the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX> themselves weren't
 		weren't like covered in a solid sheet of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX> things seemed to be okay um especially given that you know the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next day</TIMEX> it was forty degrees
 		um you know  everything started to melt and then the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX> themselves
 		icewise were okay it was just that um there were there were power lines down everywhere on the road and there were trees downed everywhere and wherever you drove was sort of like driving through an obstacle course you didn't want to
 		have to wind up hitting um
 		you know hitting a <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> or hitting a power line or hitting a phone line or anything else that was the rough part of it they closed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> for like a week just just because of that
 		so
 	
 	
 		sounds like the aftermath of like a hurricane down here
 	
 	
 		yeah that's what i'm actually told i've i've never experienced a hurricane
 	
 	
 		well we get the same things trees being uprooted limbs falling all over the place power lines getting
 		torn completely off the poles being completely pulled out of the ground
 	
 	
 		oh God
 		yeah well i guess um but typically it down there though you don't get much coldness right you get
 	
 	
 		we get maybe
 		all winter long we might end up with
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty five days</TIMEX> of really cold weather and of those
 		by the time it gets <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">lunch time</TIMEX>
 		as as long as the wind's not blowing it's bearable
 	
 	
 		how well when you say cold what do you mean by cold
 	
 	
 		uh i think of any <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty five</TIMEX> and below as cold
 	
 	
 		oh sheesh yeah um um it's right about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">now</TIMEX> when they're talking about hitting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty five</TIMEX> and forty degree <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> we're thinking heat wave
 		because occasionally what'll what'll happen here is with the wind chill it can go <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">below zero</NUMEX> quite often which is not not fun i personally hate it i'm only here for school
 	
 	
 		another thing that saves us during the winter time is if we get a breeze coming straight off the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gulf</ENAMEX> the wind chill factor
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		blows everything out of proportion uh most of the time during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the winter</TIMEX> that we've got an offshore wind which is blowing straight out
 	
 	
 		uh
 		so you don't get the wind chill there that's nice
 		that's nice uh i uh my my goal is to move some <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">place</ENAMEX> south
 		so that i don't have to worry about winters any more and just worry about you know an occasional <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty five</TIMEX> degree day i can handle but
 		the the the sad part about here is that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> starts in
 		um in you know <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early September</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September October</TIMEX> and then it ends in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX> so there isn't that much <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">spring</TIMEX> and fall here
 		it's pretty much you know lots of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> and uh it's a very long winter semicold <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> and a very gray <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> usually so
 		not uh not fun
 	
 	
 		trying to think where's the warmest the warm lines start i guess probably
 		if you're drawing a line across a map of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> put the middle of your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ruler</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		is it that low you think uh
 	
 	
 		they get snow up there but it's
 		it's not a long lasting snow it'll be there they may have a week of it then it warms back up into the high <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirties</TIMEX> and forties
 	
 	
 		um that's not too bad
 	
 	
 		you get much above you get much above the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> border on in that sector sector of the map and get up into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oklahoma</ENAMEX> they've got a little bit longer winter
 		they're catching
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		all the
 		cold breezes coming straight off the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rockies</ENAMEX> straight across <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kansas</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nebraska</ENAMEX> and there's nothing
 		the only thing that stands between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oklahoma</ENAMEX>
 		and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kansas</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nebraska</ENAMEX> there's a barb wire fence somewhere around <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Topeka</ENAMEX> that's the only thing to slow down the wind
 	
 	
 		
 
 		a little barb wire fence huh
 		well i've only been out uh i've only been in the west once so uh i was i was in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iowa</ENAMEX>
 		and it was bitter cold when i was there and that's the way that's north um that's sort of north
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">midwest</ENAMEX> though
 		so way way north of where you are so i i uh my experience wasn't wasn't quite
 		down there i i i like i said i want to wind up somewhere down in that range where it's nice and warm and
 		you know when when when you get <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty five cold</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days a year</TIMEX> rather than <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty five</TIMEX> warm <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> a year
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		which is what we wind up with
