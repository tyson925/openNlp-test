 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		okay
 	
 	
 		okay well what are we doing about recycling in our community
 	
 	
 		well well in our area we just introduced the um citywide
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh Clean King Sport</ENAMEX> campaign and we have a recycling <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mascot</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kleanaroo</ENAMEX> he's a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">kangaroo</ENAMEX> and um we're setting up curbside recycling bins for the city <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX>
 		and several of our local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX> also have recycling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stations</ENAMEX> set up in their parking lots
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and how about in your area
 	
 	
 		well in our i live in a very small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX> outside of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> area and uh we're just getting started as a matter of fact this <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX> we got a notice in the mail from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">City Hall</ENAMEX>
 		and they've informed us that uh we'd be getting more instructions in the mail in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a week or two</TIMEX> but we're going to start a separation of our refuse and separating the cans from the paper et cetera
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and apart of that we haven't really done much of anything except for uh separating your <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX> and taking those to uh an area that they've designated um
 		but in uh in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> place we've been doing it for some time separating our uh uh computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> from our normal garbage
 	
 	
 		all right so have we we've been doing the computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> and then we've also been doing our <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aluminum</ENAMEX> cans
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		what do they do with the cans
 	
 	
 		i that's the one thing i don't know i i don't know if they take them to the local aluminum uh recycling plant
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh just locally or or what i assume that's what they would do
 	
 	
 		i would assume so and then maybe do something with the money for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">charity</ENAMEX> or something
 	
 	
 		i would hope
 		yeah  i i think that's what they do i think they they give that to charity
 	
 	
 		i
 		yeah that's a good idea and and uh other than the work place and here at home um
 		i don't know too much is going on in the community i know that in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Plano</ENAMEX> it's a larger <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> in the area they they uh i believe <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about a month or two ago</TIMEX> they started having the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> separate their refuse
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		and they've even um got a particular  huge uh waste can that they have to use
 	
 	
 		oh for each different product oh okay
 	
 	
 		right uh-huh that makes it kind of easier then you remember you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i i was going to say i've seen in some of these um local mail order catalogs they've got trash can dividers for for <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> who don't have those it it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it like cuts  your trash can in half so you could put cans on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> side and and other on the other side so
 	
 	
 		other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">side</ENAMEX> that's a good idea
 	
 	
 		i think i think a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are jumping on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> wagon
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um
 		as far as you know should more be done i think there's i think there's always more that can be done
 	
 	
 		i think as we all get in the swing of things this is just a beginning don't you think
 	
 	
 		yes i've even heard them talking about uh recycling <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Freon</ENAMEX> from refrigerators refrigeration systems yes there are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> there are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> that recycle their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Freon</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh really
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and um  i'm sure there are a lot <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemicals</ENAMEX> that that can be recycled that
 	
 	
 		yeah i know the motor oil
 	
 	
 		there's a lot of
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		we have places that we can take our motor <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> to if you change your own <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> at home i
 	
 	
 		now that's we we don't have that that's neat
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">um KMart</ENAMEX> does that some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KMarts</ENAMEX> in the area where i don't have any except for the lawn motor lawn mower
 	
 	
 		oh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">um</ENAMEX> machine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> because i always have my oil changed out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> but
 	
 	
 		but but you'd think that uh <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garages</ENAMEX> could do that
 	
 	
 		yes i'm sure they do uh
 	
 	
 		i mean that would be great
 	
 	
 		um-hum because that's something that doesn't go back into the soil does it doesn't break down
 	
 	
 		no it's it's really bad to not break down
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i uh saw an article <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the other day</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ann Landers</ENAMEX> that talked about how long it takes like a cigarette butt to decompose and i think it was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty years</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		is that right i had no idea
 	
 	
 		yes
 		i i was i was flabbergasted and i think plastic was um plastic never totally total breaks down
 	
 	
 		never breaks down
 		um the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Styrofoam</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		that's the one that never did yep
 	
 	
 		yeah never did some
 	
 	
 		plastic took fifty years
 	
 	
 		fifty years
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um i know that i had heard that uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McDonald's</ENAMEX> has gotten so much flack about sending their hot <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> out in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Styrofoam</ENAMEX> that they are going to work on something
 	
 	
 		they they have here yes i used to get my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Egg McMuffin</ENAMEX> in one of those little <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Styrofoam</ENAMEX> cup uh cups like and now they wrap them in paper
 	
 	
 		other than that oh have they
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		do they well good
 	
 	
 		yes
 		so i was really glad to see that
 	
 	
 		i think they're one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX> at large that do things like that they're more aware of it
 	
 	
 		they they are good
 	
 	
 		or at least they try and do something about it first
 	
 	
 		i think they recognize their their position as a community leader
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and really work to keep that going
 	
 	
 		i think you're right
 	
 	
 		so and and the only other thing i've seen has been the setting up a compost heap in your own backyard
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but that's that's hard if you don't have a big <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">yard</ENAMEX> or if you live in an apartment
 	
 	
 		defiantly if you live in an <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> right
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that might not go over real well
 	
 	
 		right that's for sure
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		let's see has it been i think have we been our <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five minutes</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh i really don't know i haven't been timing it but i think
 	
 	
 		i know the last time i did this they came on and said
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you you have exceeded your <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">ten minutes</TIMEX> time limit hang up within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next thirty</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">seconds so</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 		oh all right
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		well i guess we'll just say good-bye then
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">okay</ENAMEX> and and i think we just hang up i don't think we have to do anything else
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		but it's been very nice talking to you okay
 	
 	
 		thank you nice to talk to you also
 	
 	
 		all righty bye-bye
 	
 	
 		bye-bye
