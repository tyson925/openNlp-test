 
     		
 	
 		
 
 		okay so uh do you own a PC
 	
 	
 		um no not personally but yes uh-huh yeah several
 	
 	
 		but you have one at work
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">okay</ENAMEX> and now because um  see i'm doing my uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Master's</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Computer Science and Computer Engineering</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and um and i don't i don't have one but i have to use them like during especially during my undergrad
 	
 	
 		right
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you you use um like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">your first couple of years</TIMEX> you use personal computers because uh you know the software you know like it's easier for you to go and run a program you know through the disk
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		because um the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grader</ENAMEX> can do it at home then as the you know as you go up higher like in your senior level you're doing projects which are are so big and you have to have so many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> sharing the same data
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		that you can't use personal computers so you have to use you know a main frame
 	
 	
 		right right yeah i know i uh i do have a uh you know a computer at home but it's one that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> has loaned me and that that's been my situation is that uh that way i can get in access our um
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		um computers that i have up here and you know do work from home
 	
 	
 		but does it have uh like a disk drive
 	
 	
 		oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		oh okay because uh the ones that we use you you know are like Unix base systems and so they don't have a disk drive you know so you can't you you the only way that you can do it is through a modem
 	
 	
 		right uh-huh
 		right
 		right
 	
 	
 		and you you know you just
 		do it that way but that's uh that's the only way that you can get to through to the system you can't store it anywhere
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right yeah no i um i i have both because that that's what i use all the time is Unix systems um versus the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOS</ENAMEX> but then i teach <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOS</ENAMEX> classes uh at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> uh-huh part time so
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 		and then you also have to do all your grading on the PC
 	
 	
 		well that that's the really neat thing i teach in the continuing education classes so i don't uh i don't have to have grade any grades no grade books so that's great
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		but uh no i find that i use the the personal computer a lot though for my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">WordPerfect</ENAMEX> and um also for my spread sheets um so i think it's extremely helpful and very useful
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well uh for us it's uh uh you know it's like for doing like you know like resumes
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and presentations we use like for example a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macintosh</ENAMEX> which is a lot easier for graphics than the PC than you know the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> PC's or anything compatible with that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 		right
 	
 	
 		due due to the fact that well you know i i haven't tested the the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PS</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two</TIMEX> yet but i don't know if the software is as easily you know like you can manage it a lot easier than than the old one the old one you had to go pick a line
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		right
 	
 	
 		use little arrows to go onto the screen and check where you wanted to start and where you know with the mouse you do it you know like <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred</NUMEX> times faster
 	
 	
 		right
 		that's true that's true
 	
 	
 		and uh you also get you know when you see it on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macintosh</ENAMEX> with you know the one i have that doesn't have any color you can look at it and that's the way it's going to print out
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and especially if you have a laser printer it's going to print out the same way as it's on the screen
 	
 	
 		oh um-hum
 	
 	
 		and so
 		with you know with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> what would happen is uh since the software that i had was it was basically you know you only see part of the page
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and so the whole page you you never can actually see it you just draw it and they have to zoom out and zoom in and you know it's like every time that you have to do something is it's really a pain
 	
 	
 		oh um-hum
 		what a hassle yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		and also you know it's like for for presentations it's like if you have to do any statistical data it can be easily represented on a on a PC it can be easily represented on a on a PC you know like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years back</TIMEX> when you didn't have that you would have to map out all this all these numbers
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and get a graph which you weren't sure if it was okay or not you know but with a with a new system i can calculate everything so fast you know like for spread sheets
 	
 	
 		right yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		right right
 	
 	
 		you can see what the trend is over the years
 	
 	
 		yeah and i love all the windows that they have out now too they have really simplified things
 	
 	
 		yeah that
 		that i i had a i had a program due and uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one one</NUMEX> window i had the program and the other one i had the program running so if there was ever a mistake i could easily check you know i could look at the program and say this is where i made the error
 	
 	
 		right right
 		right
 	
 	
 		instead of saying where did i make the error you know go back and forth and and you know you always you know the old ones you had to go out of your program load up um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh well load up the program again in this case after you load it up change it hope that's right
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 	
 	
 		get out of that run the program run uh uh as long as it took and then go back and see if that worked or not but with windows you can have the program and say it messed up in line fifty four
 	
 	
 		yes
 		yes
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so you take a look at line fifty four you take a look at the output at the same time
 		and you can see that where it messed up because you know it's like in the old computers the ones that uh we're using here <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of years ago</TIMEX> you would always have to have a printout
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		every time that you ran your program you would need a printout because everything else was erased in the background
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right right yeah i know i uh i remember my college <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>  and having to do that too
 	
 	
 		did
 		did you learn it in computer science
 	
 	
 		oh yeah uh-huh  i sure did
 	
 	
 		and when was this
 	
 	
 		uh i graduated in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eighty six</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		yeah so it's been fairly recent
 	
 	
 		yeah i know because uh all i know is that when i came here in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eighty seven</NUMEX>
 		they still had uh it was the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> to to put all your punch cards in
 	
 	
 		the cards
 		ah dear i didn't have to bother with that at all thank goodness yeah
 	
 	
 		so yeah no but it it was just sensational because i walked in and they go oh my God they're still using this it was like this is the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> you can put your punch cards in and get your program out and you know
 	
 	
 		yes
 		wow wow
 	
 	
 		you can get a hard copy of it and that's about it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh wow</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so but i mean the price of computers has gone down they said that um if the auto industry would have kept the same trend as the computer industry has ever since you know it started
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		they said that uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> would cost <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">two dollars</NUMEX> and they would run forever
 	
 	
 		oh that would be great
 	
 	
 		
 
 		so i mean it's like you know the the joke with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yugo</ENAMEX> you know it's like yeah you you know like when your uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> runs out of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> just throw it away
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and that that that's the way it would be you know it's like
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		yeah i think i'll buy a new car <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> you know so yeah but i mean the price has really gone down i mean <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> which um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> PC in like in nineteen eighty one it would cost you <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">five thousand dollars</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh sure oh sure
 	
 	
 		and now you can get it you know like for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">one thousand dollars</NUMEX> because uh you know because of the parts basically you know what
 	
 	
 		right yeah and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two eighty six</NUMEX> too so yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		the the parts and the labor is what they're charging you they're not charging you you know over pricing it because it's like if we sell it for less you know it's like we're losing money you know it's like we want to sell it to break even at least
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		right
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i think they stopped producing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> PC
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh and the uh PC <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Junior</ENAMEX> was a total failure
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		to them they had uh they're trying to get out small computers but the only problem was that when they took that one out the small computer was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> PC
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and so you couldn't you know it's like sure bring out  into the market something that's smaller when nobody nobody uses anything that's smaller than you know this you know and so
 	
 	
 		yeah oh
 	
 	
 		but over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past years</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> has been producing uh like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every two years</TIMEX> they bring out a whole new system you know like the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P C B X T D A T</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PS one PS</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> things you know and so
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it's just that you have to always compete and uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macintosh</ENAMEX> took a lot of the market from a lot of schools
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		because of of their you know you can work with it a lot easier
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true
 	
 	
 		so that's what they're trying to do oh well
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		i'll leave you back to your work and uh have a good lunch all right bye bye
 	
 	
 		okay
 		thanks  bye
