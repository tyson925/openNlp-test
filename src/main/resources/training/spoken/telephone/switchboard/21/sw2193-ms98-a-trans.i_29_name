 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		all right well what do you think about <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>'s role's in the last <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> what uh what changes have you seen
 	
 	
 		well i have noticed a lot uh more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>'s roles at work which i like in management
 		which that's good i i guess to have a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>'s
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">viewpoints</ENAMEX> and uh
 		in a way things are handled at work especially in personnel type jobs
 		which i think
 		is probably better on the hand of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> for uh
 		any kind of maternity benefits and stuff like that
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> probably understand that better than the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> do so i think that's good
 	
 	
 		well yeah yeah i would imagine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> would understand maternity a lot better than men
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		we only have to get up for you know for the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">daytime</TIMEX> feedings
 	
 	
 		i think
 		
 
 		i think that that's a good benefit i think having women
 		uh in in higher up positions stuff like that
 	
 	
 		well i've noticed that it seems uh some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> are i guess what i call the feministus
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know or you know very
 		strong uh you know women's libbers and others that don't want to be and it's it's confusing trying to figure out which one is which yeah you don't know whether to call Ms or Mrs you know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 		right
 		and how to treat them
 		right right and who wants to be treated which way
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i think they should all wear signs you know or something
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		i i i found it interesting especially uh being from a military background
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		the current fuss over whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> should go into combat or not
 	
 	
 		right i thought that was really interesting in the war i figure
 	
 	
 		i can't figure anybody who would voluntarily want to go
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		if you can stay out of it although i guess
 		although i did notice that all the ones who were saying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> should have to be in combat were too old and fat to go
 	
 	
 		
 
 		they couldn't do anything about it
 	
 	
 		now it's kind of like when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> do you course you you used to saying used to be the old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> declare the war and the young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> fight it and now and now it's it's i'm happy to see that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> have the same problem that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> has had because they got the old fat <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> yelling well yeah they ought to fight but course they don't have to go
 	
 	
 		right right
 		
 
 		that's exactly right they can just watch it
 	
 	
 		i always wanted to put <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gloria Steinem</ENAMEX> on a set of camels and send her over to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gulf</ENAMEX> and let her fight but
 	
 	
 		i think it's uh i think if they want to do it
 		you know if that's what interests them and they think you know they can handle it i think they ought to be able to do it
 	
 	
 		well they couldn't be worse than some of the men
 	
 	
 		that's right and i don't
 	
 	
 		i think it all depends on mental set more than sex
 	
 	
 		right that's exactly right now they're trained and everything so  let them do it if they want to that's that's the way it is in a lot of jobs you know like the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">firemen</ENAMEX>
 		you know for a long time they thought stuff like that you know trying to be <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">firemen policemen</ENAMEX>
 		and stuff like that now they get to be all that
 	
 	
 		well if i think if you know regardless of sex whether you can if you can handle the job then i think you should be able to do it
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but i do object to you know someone hiring a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> just because they have to meet their quota
 	
 	
 		that's exactly and i feel the same exact same way i don't think that's right
 	
 	
 		that's
 		that's really just kind of discrimination no matter how any way you put it
 	
 	
 		right you're uh you know it's the best <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> qualified i think and and that's the way it ought to be but it's as we know it's not
 	
 	
 		yeah i i stutter to think that i may be flying in a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">seven forty seven</NUMEX> with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> who got on the flight program because she happened to have the right you know
 		the right sex rather than qualifications
 	
 	
 		right
 		exactly same with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true i hate to i hate to look up and find someone who was admitted to medical school simply because she happened to be a female
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		you know
 	
 	
 		she got that scholarship
 	
 	
 		or a Black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rodriguez</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		right they need to give the scholarship to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> that's true that's true with any case i hate that but but that is true but
 	
 	
 		well i think we are that society tends to overcompensate
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		much with
 		whatever it's with the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Black the Black</ENAMEX> problem or whatever that may be now
 	
 	
 		it's yeah ethnic any ethnic problem or race
 	
 	
 		or with uh anything ethnic problems uh i think society society tends to overcompensate and we go we swing we swing out to the far left and far right trying to get everybody in
 	
 	
 		um-hum don't want to hurt anybody's feelings and get everybody covered
 	
 	
 		oh that's true oh yeah
 		God forbid you should make some kind of sexist remark and say you know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hey</ENAMEX> sweetie or something
 	
 	
 		um-hum and now everything's his you know uh his and her and everything you have to you always have to say it like that you can never say
 		you know his you know and that never has offended me when you know when someone's talking and they say you know
 		his job or something like that or
 	
 	
 		right a wait person
 	
 	
 		that's never
 		i mean i understand that they're talking about the job  not the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> in the job that's that's always
 		that's always been strange i thought but some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> like to fight it
 	
 	
 		what do you think about uh about our new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX> since she happens to be a female
 	
 	
 		but
 		yeah she is she  i
 		i don't know i i can't say that
 		that i i well i can't say that i did or didn't vote for her because i didn't get to vote <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this time</TIMEX> but
 		i don't know that i'm i guess i'm ready just hard to see a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> in such a
 		i guess powerful position
 	
 	
 		i think i'm more scared of her not because she's a female but because more for her political political beliefs and what she says she's going to do i think i'd be scared of anybody male or female in that position
 	
 	
 		right right
 		right
 	
 	
 		although you see more and more uh
 		more and more of the ladies that are becoming active in politics
 	
 	
 		i know that's true and
 	
 	
 		and you know occupying a very prominent role with the politics and in the business sector
 	
 	
 		right inexperience also that's something that bothers me is uh even though she is you know the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">treasurer</ENAMEX> forever it bothers me that i don't know that she doesn't have
 		that much background i guess in
 		well it's hard to say i don't know something about it just just kind of bothers me
 	
 	
 		i think her backgro und totally bothers me
 	
 	
 		yeah she i mean she seems on the outside
 		uh good and everything but
 		but i don't know it just it just kind of bothers me and that that just may be because we're not used to having i'm not used to having <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> in in roles like that you know as role models
 	
 	
 		that could be yeah
 	
 	
 		you're just always used to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> i mean that's just something that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> always did
 	
 	
 		yeah the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX> was you know the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX> he did this
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		an d now we got the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX> she's going to do that
 	
 	
 		that's exactly right and
 	
 	
 		wonder what they'll call if she was married and wonder if they'll refer to him as the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		probably yeah and in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> you know we had the uh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Annette Strauss</ENAMEX> and she's a
 		uh <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman mayor</ENAMEX> so
 	
 	
 		oh yeah <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Houston</ENAMEX> got a female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mayor</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		do they
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i didn't know that
 	
 	
 		she oh yeah she's a she's a staunch supporter of all the uh gay rights matter fact she lives down in the gay district
 	
 	
 		oh does she really
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		oh Lord
 	
 	
 		so i think you know i i'm not sure whether she was elected because she was a female or because or because she supported the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gays</ENAMEX> i really don't know because a large you know there's a large <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> down there of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gays</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 		big combination of both
 		she's got covered all the bases didn't she
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah she seems to be interesting i i and you see more and more uh you know uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mickey Leland</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> is
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		taking over his seat and course you know we got the like you said they elected a female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mayor</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> one in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Houston</ENAMEX> we got a female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX> and there's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two or three</NUMEX> more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governors</ENAMEX> in in the in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> that are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		right
 		that's really good i guess
 	
 	
 		and there's quite a few if they can do the job i think more power to them you know i would i i i would dearly love to find out that you know i could i could say well i guess i was wrong about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ann Richards</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah yeah they always they they say a lot of times that
 		you know <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> have more emotions and they can or cannot handle a job because of that
 		so that's going to be interesting to see how that kind of stuff does play into it because a lot of times you know you do look at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and they never seem to show any emotion they just
 	
 	
 		yeah but i think we're bred that way you know i think i think it's part of the
 	
 	
 		yeah exactly and that's
 	
 	
 		of the of the male mystique
 	
 	
 		that's
 		that's sad to say
 		that that that that's true though
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		course the reason yeah i think it's going to be harder for for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next ten years or so</TIMEX> to make strides in say you know the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southwest</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Midwest</ENAMEX> and you down here
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		in the southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> than it will be up
 		in the more liberal <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">east</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">west</ENAMEX> coast
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		this is you know
 	
 	
 		i am surprised though that we do have so many that are in politics down here
 	
 	
 		we don't have quite as many as they do east and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">west</ENAMEX> coast but this is kind of the last bastion of the you know the
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		the good ole <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> with the pickup and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">rifle</ENAMEX> on the back and the quart of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beer</ENAMEX> down your down between your legs driving down the road
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		and of course that's changing too but you know i think and that came about because of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> you know <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mothers Against Drunk Driving MADD</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		that's right
 		that was a good that was a good leadership
 	
 	
 		the greatest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> is mothers
 	
 	
 		that women
 		that's what they say that's true
 	
 	
 		if you could mobilize the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> you got them
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that's true well i hope
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know that they
 		whatever these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> of ours do that everything's for the good that just like like you said it's with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> or a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> it should however they're going to be able to uh take care of us
 		i don't know
 	
 	
 		just depends on who's going to exploit us when
 	
 	
 		yeah i do know though in our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> we don't have a lot of
 		upper
 		upper management <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> i mean we rarely have any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> that are upper management
 	
 	
 		is that because they're just not uh you just don't have any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> that are there or no one has
 	
 	
 		i don't know
 		
 
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ascended</ENAMEX> to that level yet
 	
 	
 		i don't know that's really that's really well it's it's so uh
 		i guess we're we're kind of the good old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> type atmosphere of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> always did the you know the engineering and all this and the technology and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> are so i'm i'm sure that's has a lot to do with it
 	
 	
 		i've noticed that in a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> that you know everybody says well there's no <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> in upper management and my first question well is there anyone qualified to be there
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		just because you happen to be a a female or a minority or anything else doesn't automatically mean you it shouldn't mean that you get promoted to that part
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that's right that's exactly right
 		so but a lot of more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> are starting their own <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX> i've noticed than
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and that's that's pretty interesting
 	
 	
 		we have several here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Austin</ENAMEX> that have uh
 		i guess started up uh one of them matter fact runs a furniture
 		uh place she builds library furniture
 	
 	
 		oh does she that's pretty interesting
 	
 	
 		and she
 		and she's take she's taking over and it's uh it's it's <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a million dollar</NUMEX> a year <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> and she's having a ball doing it
 	
 	
 		yeah there's a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX> here in uh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> who started a mozzarella or a cheese <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> can't remember the name of it and she's a multimillionaire from it and i i just think God if only it could be me
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		i've got several uh matter fact i have some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> that own <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">machine shops</ENAMEX> and they have several
