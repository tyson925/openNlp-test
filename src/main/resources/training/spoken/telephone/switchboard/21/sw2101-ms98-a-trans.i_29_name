 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well do you have any uh television programs that you watch regularly
 	
 	
 		oh this is kind of tough i don't too often watch you know shows that are on on a regular basis
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i don't have a lot of time and i don't really like some of them to tell you the truth i mean i don't think they have any redeeming value
 	
 	
 		
 
 		no
 	
 	
 		but uh oh i watch things like uh <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Sixty Minutes</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every week</TIMEX> uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		ooh
 		it's kind of tough to think of some of the others although i do watch some of some of those frivolous things uh like on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">nights</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">nine o'clock</TIMEX> when i get <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> from aerobics i will watch uh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Knots Landing</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh you will
 	
 	
 		yeah just something like that for you know
 		<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">uh end of the evening</TIMEX> type of thing but uh
 	
 	
 		relax
 	
 	
 		how about you
 	
 	
 		well i watch um i like news programs like you mentioned and sometimes i will watch um like the cable news <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> evening news program
 	
 	
 		um
 		yeah i don't get that so i don't have that choice
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah i i like that i i watch that a couple of times a week
 		um it comes on like at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">nine o'clock at night</TIMEX> and i really don't have any like situation comedies that i watch regularly i i have seen that um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murphy Brown</ENAMEX> that comes on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">nights</TIMEX> before and it's kind of cute and but i don't
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah yeah there's a couple of those i've seen once in a while uh i can't think of the name of the one that has the uh military
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh fellow i mean he's playing a military part he's the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Designing Women</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh the
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		right i know who you're talking about i haven't i have seen it i think maybe once
 	
 	
 		yeah you know it was it was on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time when i saw it and you know it it's pretty cute
 	
 	
 		i like that
 		well i um i we really don't watch
 		too many programs regularly my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> like some of the morning <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>'s shows when they're home they um i just have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> who's in kindergarten so in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX> they will like to watch like um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eureka</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Castle</ENAMEX> it's called it's just like a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Sesame Street</ENAMEX> show but
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 		and they watch a couple of shows like that
 		but i don't watch any <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">daytime</TIMEX> TV at all
 	
 	
 		yeah no i don't
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		i guess uh there's some uh things on channel thirteen that i watch pretty regularly
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturdays</TIMEX> they have uh a variety of things uh and a lot of times i record it and watch it some other time but uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		they have programs on uh house repairs and how to build things and um they have a calligraphy show and i do calligraphy so i watch that
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh that's nice
 	
 	
 		and um they have a lot of cooking shows
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and oh you know i'll just sort of have it on sometimes to just sort of pick up little tidbits from those i don't sit and watch them but but i enjoy some of it and especially if i'm
 		uh cooking on a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</TIMEX> or something and one of those is on it kind of inspires me
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		that sounds like a good idea
 		i notice that um since we moved here that we we did get the cable TV and when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX> comes out on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> i sometimes read through the movies that will be listed
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i record some and then uh we have just totally cut down and we never go to like a video tape rental anymore because
 		there's always plenty of things that we can record and then watch and then record over it something else
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and so that's been really nice because if you decide <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one evening</TIMEX> you would like to stay home and have a quiet <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</TIMEX> and watch a movie then you have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two or three</NUMEX> saved
 	
 	
 		yeah we do some of that in i'm fact i probably am more interested in watching some of the movies that are on TV than you know other kinds of things
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		well that's probably what i watch most frequently besides like news programs is
 		the movies and they have a couple of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> that are like nostalgic older movies
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		that i have really enjoyed that i'm seeing for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time  like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marx Brothers</ENAMEX>  and things like that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah those are pretty good i i like those old ones much better than some of the new stuff
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		right and so we we have really enjoyed that and it's really nice not to be running out some of the video rentals can be expensive and
 	
 	
 		yeah well going to the movie can be unbelievable
 	
 	
 		and
 		um-hum right going and paying <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">six dollars</NUMEX> for a ticket for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">theater</ENAMEX> or something so we i have and it's so convenient at home and you can do it anytime you you take the notion
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and so i have really enjoyed that but but there are i do have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> that watch programs like they want to see a particular program and
 		they are either <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">home</ENAMEX> watching it or definitely recording it they have some programs that they won't miss
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		i'm not that hung up on most things i mean if i miss something big deal
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yes well and things are repeated
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true
 	
 	
 		so often that
 		you know if if i have seen just a program once chances are it'll be that exact same show  if i ever decide to tune it in again
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		the only one i've ever seen and it'll be showing again
 		pretty funny
 	
 	
 		yep
 	
 	
 		but uh TV is something that we try to not um deliberately try not to get hung up on it like you say
 	
 	
 		yeah we do too it too many other things to do and too much going on
 	
 	
 		um-hum and we don't want our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> to to grow up thinking that that's what you do with your spare time
 	
 	
 		right i agree
 	
 	
 		so it's a little bit
 		something we try doing and there's there's a lot of good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>'s programs that you could watch they could watch <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">several hours every day</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and you could say oh that's a good program for them because it's educational but still you want them to go out and do other things even if they're good programs you don't want them sitting there watching them
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		anyway
 		well
 	
 	
 		okay well we probably exhausted that huh
 	
 	
 		yeah that was pretty good i i like that and um i guess it's time to go
 	
 	
 		okay i enjoyed talking to you
 	
 	
 		yes nice to have spoken with you too bye-b ye
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">okay good-bye</ENAMEX>
