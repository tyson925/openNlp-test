 
     		
 	
 		well do you have a lawn
 	
 	
 		yes we have a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> with a big backyard for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> to play in and a pretty good size front yard
 	
 	
 		oh good so who cuts the grass
 	
 	
 		my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> it's not a job that i enjoy at all
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well i used to own a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> and when i owned my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> i had a small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">yard</ENAMEX> and a small front yard and a small backyard then i cut the grass
 		but i sold it so now i live in an apartment
 	
 	
 		so you don't have to fool with any of that anymore
 	
 	
 		so i don't have to fool with any of it no
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well i'm big into the plant i like the the flower beds and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> a lot better than i do the lawn
 	
 	
 		oh then my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> and you would probably get along well um-hum
 	
 	
 		so
 		yeah i had used to have a garden until the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> got older and we don't have any more <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> in the backyard so now all i've got is <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> instead of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetables</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah we talk about um
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laura</ENAMEX> talks about growing uh right right now she's interested i think in a herb garden she mentioned <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this morning</TIMEX> that she could grow just you know flower box
 	
 	
 		hum
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i think that's but i think uh after after we um
 		after i finish school and we're ready to you know settle down someplace and i get a decent job then we'll look for something probably with a nice size yard that we can have a garden
 	
 	
 		yeah it's nice to have nothing is better than going out there and picking your own <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tomatoes</ENAMEX> or different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetables</ENAMEX> and things to eat
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah that yeah that and that's the big problem with being in an <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> is we've talked about it and even uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laura</ENAMEX> even said you know as a wedding present we should ask for these big pots
 		you know that we could put on the front porch and because the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment complex</ENAMEX> actually we have the whole front porch and somebody else lives on the other side so we thought about you know having putting it in pots and putting the pots just on our steps
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and growing maybe <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tomatoes</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> like right now it would be beautiful in in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maryland</ENAMEX> you know daffodils are just all blooming so it would be really pretty
 	
 	
 		um
 		yeah container gardening is really pretty easy because i've done some of it before
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you just need to get the you need to get the right mix of soil so that it doesn't dry out
 	
 	
 		yep yep
 	
 	
 		and so that your <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> because and then you have to you still have to water them a lot of times
 		once a here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> you have to water sometimes twice <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a day</TIMEX> because it gets so hot in the summer
 	
 	
 		yeah well we wouldn't have to worry about that
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		right now we're going through we just it just rained <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all day today</TIMEX> or it's been raining <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">most of the morning</TIMEX> drizzling off and on but yeah
 	
 	
 		um
 		well we've got a beautiful day and there are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> out everywhere all of our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> are out scalping their <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">lawn</ENAMEX> for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time
 	
 	
 		oh really this is what is it i guess your growing season's just about to begin oh
 	
 	
 		yes we hit our we'll hit <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">our last spring</TIMEX> freeze
 		it snowed here <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">as late as May</TIMEX> before but that was really unusual our our our last freeze is usually about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX> fifteenth
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 		yeah that's a
 	
 	
 		and so we're all everybody's out planting and buying and
 	
 	
 		yeah see we're a little bit later than that but that's right that's about right about the same yeah
 	
 	
 		seeing what died
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but i think um i think you you though must have much warmer weather through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the winter</TIMEX> so that's
 	
 	
 		yeah it makes it nice for gardening when it's when it's like that because we can grow a lot of things
 		even through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the winter</TIMEX> that uh y'all can't grow we can start i can start a garden in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July</TIMEX> i've done that and and plant some of the uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		sturdier <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crops broccoli</ENAMEX> and things like that you have to really water it a lot when it's when it's young like that and it's in the heat but then
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah and then <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August</TIMEX> yeah
 	
 	
 		then as the fall comes on you get a you can get a really beautiful <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> crop
 		of a lot of the cooler weather <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetables</ENAMEX> and sometimes that's the only some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peas</ENAMEX> and different things like that that's the only time of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> you can grow them
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		hum
 	
 	
 		because otherwise it's too it gets if you start them when it's cooler in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the spring</TIMEX> then it gets too hot in the summer
 	
 	
 		right yeah that jeez i never thought of that because see here our growing season is basically done
 		by um well you might have some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tomatoes</ENAMEX> still blooming in uh in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX> the begining very begining <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">first week of October</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but normally everything's done by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September end of September</TIMEX> means you're basically done growing anything
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um yeah but it gets a lot colder up there a lot quicker because we can grow sometimes there have been times when when i've grown stuff out i've grown broccoli up and through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah because it
 		oh gee that'd be nice
 	
 	
 		and still have it producing and okra okra will grow real okra will grow to be <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">six foot</NUMEX> tall it's just
 	
 	
 		um-hum we don't even grow okra up here
 	
 	
 		yeah you probably don't have the right temperatures and stuff probably not too many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> eat it up there either it seems to be kind of a southern delicacy
 	
 	
 		yeah we don't have the right whatever yeah
 		well i think it it it it's getting um a little bit more popular because see there's a lot of the um
 		first you know first the big wave of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tex-Mex</ENAMEX> food came by you know and so we're we're big into <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tacos</ENAMEX> and stuff up here <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">now and</TIMEX> and taco <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salads</ENAMEX> and things
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 	
 	
 		which they probably <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mexican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> don't even know what a taco <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salad</ENAMEX> is but i think it's now it's moving up too because uh just a change you know just something different
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		plus it's a little bit more vegetable oriented and i think the uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> have been a long time holdout for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beef</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">potatoes</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i think it's our <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Irish</ENAMEX> descent
 	
 	
 		maybe so
 	
 	
 		yeah but i think it it's changing now yeah so i so we do know what okra is i wouldn't have known what it was when i was a teenager though
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		oh well what's your favorite <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> if you were you know you were talking about your containers maybe you were going to get those started what would you like to put in them
 	
 	
 		well we were going to probably just going to start well because we're going to be moving we're talking about just putting throwing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tomatoes</ENAMEX> in
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know and then uh but also things like tulips i think uh i would have liked to had <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> like daffodils blooming right now you know
 	
 	
 		yeah tulips is just kind of late because you have to you have to force them
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		if you were going to do that you might put some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">strawberries</ENAMEX> in there around the edges
 	
 	
 		yeah we we talked about that too in fact um our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister-in-law</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laura</ENAMEX>'s
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> you know was talking about you know putting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">strawberries</ENAMEX> uh moving their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">strawberries</ENAMEX> because they just moved
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i it's this problem with being in school you know they just moved and they took their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">strawberries</ENAMEX> that they had out in their yard and put them all in containers
 		and they're going to decide what they're going to do with them i think but they're going to let them bloom <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> in the containers
 	
 	
 		yeah they'll work that way and they're they're kind of pretty they've got little white <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		um-hum would you have to stake them up do aren't they do they grow along the ground <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">strawberries</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		long as you
 		no
 		they'd grow kind of like a <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">vine</ENAMEX> they they put out little feelers kind of like an ivy would
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and and along those is where that's where the strawberry grows and it will eventually take over an area you plant them when you plant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">strawberries</ENAMEX> you plant them like
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">eight inches</NUMEX> or more you can even plant further than that but to cover an area so you cover you put them <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">eight inches</NUMEX> apart all through a flower bed
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		and by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next year</TIMEX> you'll have pretty much a solid bed of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">strawberries</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh
 		see i've never grown <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">strawberries</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		they're real simple that's why i like them i just put a bunch out because you just put them out there and you water them
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		the bugs don't least here at least here the bugs don't particularly bother them
 		and they don't require a lot of fertilizing or care you know during the rest of the year
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum just water
 	
 	
 		yeah and then about every <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five years</TIMEX> you have to dig them up and throw them away and start over again they don't last forever
 	
 	
 		um-hum well they say aren't maybe you're supposed to cut them back cut them and
 	
 	
 		it that can help but you just get to a point where they're just not productive anymore
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's just a kind of uh just the way the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> is
 	
 	
 		yeah rotationary thing
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		oh that's interesting see because i've never really grown <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">strawberries</ENAMEX> lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tomatoes</ENAMEX> but never really strawberries
 	
 	
 		yeah i like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tomatoes</ENAMEX> but i always end up with when i've grown them i i end up with the little <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cherry tomatoes</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of them and i can't figure out what to do with them all
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of thousand you can't even give them away
 	
 	
 		yeah because everybody else is growing
 	
 	
 		i can remember as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX> growing up my whole <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> all my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> grew <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">strawberries</ENAMEX> grew excuse me grew tomatoes
 	
 	
 		the same kind of thing
 	
 	
 		so whenever somebody would come over your <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> they'd always bring some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tomatoes</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">well</ENAMEX> but you grew your own <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tomatoes</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so if somebody brings you <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half a dozen</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tomatoes</ENAMEX> it doesn't do you any good because you already had a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half a dozen</NUMEX> you know pulled that day
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it's really funny
 	
 	
 		yeah some other things that'll grow good in those containers and you can you can mix and match the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> with your your <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetables</ENAMEX> and grow around them marigolds and impatiens
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		they do real good especially impatiens because you tend to get shade when you're on a porch area part of the time
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i mix all all my flower beds are mixed up i've got onions behind the irises and
 	
 	
 		well that's makes sense though
 	
 	
 		
 
 		all back and forth and around yeah because they're going be they'll grow <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">now</TIMEX> from now until the about
 		middle of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June</TIMEX> then i'll have all the onions and they'll be out and then i'll put in some flowers
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">annuals</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the rest of the year</TIMEX> and some color
 	
 	
 		um oh you are a big <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gardener</ENAMEX> huh
 	
 	
 		yeah i like getting in the dirt i just don't i hate mowing
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it's just too hot and it has to be done too often
 	
 	
 		yeah i guess the more you plant the less you have to mow
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		because that's a when i had my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">yard</ENAMEX> it was you know it was it was really a hassle
 		uh cutting grass was just a terrible just the thought of it was a terrible thing oh i used to hate it
 	
 	
 		yeah with ours it wouldn't be so bad we had a self propelled mower but the self propelled part broke
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and so it doesn't and then and then it weighs <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a ton</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">yep</ENAMEX> because it's when it's self propelled it's heavy yeah
 	
 	
 		because it's
 		yeah and it's so it's supposed to pull itself along and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> it doesn't bother him and he i'm got out and mowed for him <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX> just to be nice so he wouldn't have to do it when he got home
 		and i said what is with this mower i can't even push it around the yard
 	
 	
 		yeah that
 	
 	
 		and you know he's like well i get more exercise pushing it around
 	
 	
 		
 
 		my uh my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> went out and bought a mower used you know he was looking for a lawn mower and he he just had bought a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> he lived in an <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> before
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and he bought a used mower it was a real big heavy <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> and he said that that you know basically they they sold it on him because you know it was a macho thing
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		the bigger and heavier the lawn mower the more macho the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> behind it
 		so you know of course he wouldn't couldn't buy one of those little little tiny skinny ones that you can get at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the uh one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aames</ENAMEX> or
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		the the fast mowing places you had to buy a big one you know because it meant something for your macho same reason why you have to drive a big truck with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> wheels you know with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> wheel drive
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it was a macho thing he had to use that but then after he used it <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one year</TIMEX> he took it back to where he got it used and he sold it back to them and traded it in for another one that was smaller
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		because he said it was just too dang heavy
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		too many trips around the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">yard</ENAMEX> with that thing huh for sure
 	
 	
 		yeah plus i think he lives at a small hillside too so
 	
 	
 		oh gosh
 	
 	
 		yeah cut trying to cut it sideways on an angle and turning around you know without it tipping over was a pain
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		that's the other thing with my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> he gets
 		he he's one of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> he didn't care about the flower beds and stuff we i guess we divide it pretty well that way but he he gets real picky about the grass he wants to get out there and he cuts it on diagonal
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and goes all this back and forth and you know and gets the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">weed</ENAMEX> eater out and trims all the little bits around the flower beds and all the little bits around the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> that he did n't get
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		he'll go out there and spend <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">four hours</TIMEX> on the lawn
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well it's probably his his his personal time while he's cutting the grass he's probably thinking about something else
 	
 	
 		i guess
 	
 	
 		it's probably and plus no one bothers him you know you walk behind a lawn mower making all that noise no one ever talks to you you know you're on your own
 	
 	
 		
 
 		no nobody's going to bother you
