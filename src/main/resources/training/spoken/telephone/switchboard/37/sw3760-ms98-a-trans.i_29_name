 
     		
 	
 		okay um we're guess we're supposed to talk about things we do in our spare time um
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i basically read books
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		what i do sometimes when everybody's off gone to bed my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> are in bed my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> in bed i just every once in a while i'll just stay up and
 		finish a book that i'm i usually have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about three</NUMEX> books that i'm going on i'll work on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> for a little bit you know and then on the next <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> but that's kind of
 	
 	
 		well that's pretty impressive to have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> books going
 	
 	
 		not always just sometimes
 	
 	
 		oh yeah and and what kind of books do you read
 	
 	
 		um just really different ones um
 		i had one that i was reading on um raising your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and another <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> on a
 		on a biography and another <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> on a um
 		um like a crime story  you know a truth crime story
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		oh do you like those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">detective</ENAMEX> stories
 	
 	
 		yeah but it this this is a true one it was this seemed a little different so i was  reading that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> last night
 	
 	
 		oh well that's interesting i i actually like to read also but
 		i usually fall into one of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> categories either
 		true science fiction or fantasy on one hand or highly technical
 	
 	
 		yeah its like my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		kind of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or the other
 	
 	
 		you must uh work for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> yeah my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> does too
 	
 	
 		i
 		i do yes
 		yeah and i'm a computer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientist</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah it gets
 	
 	
 		but i have a lot of other hobbies i i well yeah i i i'm kind of um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh really
 	
 	
 		i i guess what you'd call it a project <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> yeah and i love i like i have a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shop</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		when things break around the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> i always try and fix them myself and so hobby it's it's it's its funny uh from the one stand point it's work
 		but it's a hobby too that that i enjoy to do to find broken
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah like what kinds of things do you fix
 	
 	
 		well essentially anything you'd find in a house
 		uh a a stove or an oven or a broken piece of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">porcelain</ENAMEX> or uh
 		chipped tile on the floor i mean just anything
 	
 	
 		oh and you have a shop
 	
 	
 		well it's it's not anything elaborate it's just a work bench with a gazillion tools
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but enough that
 		again for anything in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> i can probably
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah you can fix just about everything and anything
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		well that's great
 	
 	
 		and in the car i guess the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> too
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so that's i i think i would probably consider that a hobby although sometimes it gets to be excessive
 	
 	
 		yeah that's that's pretty much like my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> he's
 		he's pretty uh mobile in that area too he he works on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> we barely take them in
 	
 	
 		yeah i
 	
 	
 		he works on irons irons and all those TV's and stuff too we rarely have to take those things in too
 	
 	
 		right yeah i i think it it
 		it it not only can it be fun but it can certainly help your finances
 	
 	
 		oh yeah yeah definitely
 	
 	
 		so do you have any artistic <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">um i wanna i guess i wanna</ENAMEX> say creative or artistic hobbies
 	
 	
 		um
 		gosh not really i mean i during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> i work on you know like
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">um</ENAMEX> holiday sweat shirts and those kinds of things but
 	
 	
 		oh yeah well that's good
 	
 	
 		but um
 		not really
 	
 	
 		yeah well i don't necessarily either i can plink out a song or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> on a piano and i can
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		um i i don't necessarily draw or do any of that kind of art i guess graphics arts is that what that would be called it i can't like do any of that but sweat shirts is certainly impressive
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		um i belong to this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> for um with if you have preschool <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> you know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh every once and a while they'll have a a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">craft</ENAMEX> um session for the moms
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and those are really neat and we learned to do the um transfer pictures on the sweatshirts
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		transfer photos and um those are really neat so we learn different crafts like that um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		i see well that's neat that's a i guess i consider that a hobby do you do you <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cook</ENAMEX> for a hobby or do you
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		no  i cook dinner  and its not i don't consider it a hobby  but um
 	
 	
 		do you
 		
 
 		that's something you
 		
 
 		i understand that
 	
 	
 		you know i no i'm not a real elaborate cook or anything like that unfortunately i like to bake off and on and usually once a week i'll bake something but its not
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
  
 	
 	
 		anything elaborate you know
 		at least i don't think it is
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		but i think that still borders on hobby
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		probably the other thing i do which
 		i'm sure it'll sound horrible to you but is i program for fun on my computer
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so i'll i have little projects little computer projects going on that i consider hobbies
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but drive my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> crazy
 	
 	
 		oh
 		well good you have a computer at home
 	
 	
 		i do yes
 	
 	
 		oh good yeah
 	
 	
 		in fact there's actually several of them here right now not not all of them being mine
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		wow then you are busy
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		wow that's really good
 	
 	
 		so uh i wonder if you you could construe raising <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> as being a hobby
 	
 	
 		well you know one of the books that i did read that i was reading and i stopped because it's so
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		its the book is so detailed and you have to sometimes i have to go back and read the page over again because i didn't quite get it all
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh it is so detailed
