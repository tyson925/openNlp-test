 
     		
 	
 		well <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael</ENAMEX> what do you think about um funding for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> research do you
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well um uh that's something i've never thought a lot about um i've i work in a hospital and i've worked in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about fifteen years</TIMEX> and i've taken care of a few <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oops
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um when they asked us did did we want to um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		keep it the same or uh spend more or spend less i think uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i think right now what what they're spending is adequate uh my for my personal opinion
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um because i think it's something that's gonna take them a while to come up with a uh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX> for i don't think it's gonna be that easy to come up with or i think they already would have by now you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and um so i don't know if if spending a lot more money would really make any difference right now i think they're doing the is as much research as they can possibly do you know and uh what about you
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		well i guess i'm not too aware of how much they're spending right now you know
 	
 	
 		i'm not either i'm definitely not aware of how much
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh it's something i've never really kept up with at all
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah  i mean i go ahead um-hum
 	
 	
 		um  i don't know
 		i'm not sure uh i know uh i've always thought more about the disease rather than the  the research you know what i mean  and uh that sort of thing
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh yeah</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um if if we were talking about the money um i'd just have to say
 		what they're spending is probably enough simply because i don't know that much about it you know
 	
 	
 		yeah  yeah  i mean i i can see that research is needed  and you know definitely i mean it's becoming a major problem
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i think so i think so
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh i guess the area that i think more about is i would like to see them  focus on uh preventing it uh in more you know
 	
 	
 		yeah well that's true that's true because um it's a such an easily preventable disease
 	
 	
 		right and i  i feel like just saying uh safe sex is not the answer it's it's uh  abstinence in certain cases and  yeah and knowing you know
 	
 	
 		um
 		no it's definitely not
 		that's true that's true um myself um  um i'm just recently or about to get a divorce
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh course i'm not all ready to just run out there and start dating everybody i can or anything but it's sort of scary
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		to find yourself single again you know and um because you never know what's gonna happen  you don't know who you're gonna come across you know course it's it's not that i'm wanting to
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i'm not gonna wanting to go and have sex with everybody i see but it's something you got to think about these days a single person
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know and um i mean it certainly changed my attitude about that in a hurry and um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i think for a lot of people it has so
 	
 	
 		certainly yeah
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		but um uh i know that uh in some of these larger <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> they're passing out free syringes
 		and all of that sort of thing to prevent you know so that uh the drug <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">addicts</ENAMEX> won't be getting dirty needles and everything  and uh i don't know i don't think that's a bad idea
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		drug <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">addicts</ENAMEX> um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i know it uh sort of doesn't address the problem of drug addiction  it just sort of keeps that going
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but um i don't know at least drug addiction can be treated whereas <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> so far cannot be
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know so i don't know that i think that's i'm not too too much against the the passing out of the free syringes myself i don't know what do you think about that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		well  yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> that's that's a hard issue  it really is
 	
 	
 		it's it really is it really is they gave us a hard topic
 	
 	
 		yeah  i mean i i definitely think that it's the drug problem that needs to be addressed but as you say um
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> i mean in the meantime well  someone who's not ready to give up <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs um</ENAMEX> you know if they're perpetrating perpetrating the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> problem  passing that on to each other then  you know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		that's true that's true
 		yeah you know i guess if you consider the two problems drug addiction an <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS AIDS</ENAMEX> would have to have come first i guess as far as
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		something to uh to do about it so so i don't know um course there's so many things in the world where
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		if you solve <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> problem you may be creating another  you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh so i guess you just have to take the two problems and see which is worse and which is the most important to solve at the time and i don't know but um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh yeah</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but i've never looked into how much money they're spending i have i have no idea
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i know a lot of our tax money goes to that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh i really have never looked into it i have no idea um
 	
 	
 		yeah i haven't either i've heard you know uh different voices speaking up and saying  we're not spending enough and  mostly that's what i've heard so i don't know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		right sure
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and yet i know it's um it sounds like big money to me  but it probably takes a lot
 	
 	
 		yeah i think it is i think it is
 		yeah it does every it seems to take more than uh for any little thing they do it seems to take a lot more money that you would think it would you know but uh
 	
 	
 		so
 		um-hum yeah  did you have any fear working in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> with that
 	
 	
 		uh that's one thing i've never really feared um  uh i a lot of the my family
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know they fear me working like that and under some some of those conditions but um uh i don't fear it at all um i work in in the operating <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> a lot  and um and of course when we
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
