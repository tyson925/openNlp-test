 		hi
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and then when i graduated and we got married and everything i really kind of lost interest in following <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> have you been following any
 	
 	
 		not too much um who is it from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mavericks</ENAMEX> that just wasn't there some controversy <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about one</NUMEX> of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX> that didn't get to play so now he doesn't he didn't get to play the whole game so now he doesn't want to play at all or something
 	
 	
 		oh no i know they're always having um i mean i can't believe the amount of money that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX> make in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> place and i mean i know that they have a short um career and everything
 	
 	
 		its crazy
 		right but even so i mean i don't think i will make <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a million</NUMEX> in or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">three million</NUMEX>  in a life time let alone <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a season</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		that's true it's really a lot but uh my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> always gets um season tickets to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Utah Jazz</ENAMEX> and um
 	
 	
 		yep
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so she watches their games a lot and and everything but i don't believe we've ever been involved with any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> that you know makes it to the play-offs
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah we came from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oakland</ENAMEX> i went to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BYU</ENAMEX> also
 	
 	
 		too much
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		you did
 	
 	
 		yep any way and see um we use to go to some of the the games there but we really haven't done much with the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Mavericks</ENAMEX> here
 	
 	
 		well i was at uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BYU</ENAMEX> when they made it to the play-offs and i think they played <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Notre Dame</ENAMEX> or something
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um for the big game i can't remember now that was so seems like it was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eons ago</TIMEX> it was like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten years ago</TIMEX> i think and um i remember
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		did you know let me think who was on that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> there was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dave Callus</ENAMEX> or a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gordon Breun</ENAMEX> remember those names
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">um</ENAMEX> isn't that the one that was like the star <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">player</ENAMEX> was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Danny Ainge</ENAMEX> i think he started playing for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boston Boston Celtics</ENAMEX> after that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		Celtics right right
 	
 	
 		and um  and um and there was another the center
 		it's been so long i can't think of anyone's name but um i i was there <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that year</TIMEX> and enjoyed that game and uh but mostly like i say i haven't been following the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> and don't know who's got what record
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right so do you play for your ward team
 	
 	
 		i haven't played uh since i broke my knee cap  but um i did play in high school i was on our high school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX>' team
 	
 	
 		oh oh
 		uh-huh where did you go to high school
 	
 	
 		well i lived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Missouri</ENAMEX> and i went and i played for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Parkview High School</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Missouri</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Springfield Missouri</ENAMEX> and i played um a forward
 	
 	
 		oh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and um i enjoyed that then and that's i always loved sports do you play for your ward
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um i kind of stopped playing for my ward because i didn't like the sportsmanship with the stake
 	
 	
 		the problem that is a problem
 	
 	
 		so i play for a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Richardson City</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">league</ENAMEX> now
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but as far as knowing anything about professional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> you know when they said to put
 		put down what you're interested in i i wasn't really thinking about  talking about
 	
 	
 		no well i was thinking about my own personal basketball experiences as opposed to professional because i'd rather play than watch any thing
 	
 	
 		right  right
 		right
 	
 	
 		and um so i'm you know like i
 	
 	
 		do you have any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX> that you like watching
 	
 	
 		well i um i have one i don't like his name his last name was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sampson</ENAMEX> do you remember him and he because he came to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Houston</ENAMEX> when i lived there and um to play for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Houston</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> and he was really
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i thought a bad sport and uh and i haven't followed like i say
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		it really only takes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">player</ENAMEX> to really give any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> a bad rap you know one that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah that's really true but um
 	
 	
 		publicity bound you know that
 	
 	
 		well and i also don't want to spend so much of my time um memorizing statistics
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and um keeping you know  being wrapped up in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> and caring whether they win or lose in the sense that it makes a big difference in my life you know because i just don't have that kind of time
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah that's right
 		you know once it gets into the finals then i i kind of root for one or the other but up until then you know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		that's true and and you know i get i have interest in the games but i'm satisfied to watch a score in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX> or on you know the sports news report or something
 	
 	
 		yeah the highlights
 	
 	
 		right rather than just like you say watch clips from the game
 	
 	
 		do you have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> that play
 	
 	
 		no i my both my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> are little they're just in kindergarten and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> grade
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
