 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		what was the topic
 	
 	
 		uh just about um it would be interesting to discuss the social changes of the last <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty years</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		i said uh
 		right right
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and um i guess for me the most obvious is <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> in the work field
 	
 	
 		well that's a good one i hadn't thought about that yeah
 	
 	
 		that uh of course when i was growing up not very many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> went to work at all most everyone was at home
 	
 	
 		yeah really
 	
 	
 		and some of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teachers</ENAMEX> or something seemed a little bit embarrassed that their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mothers</ENAMEX> weren't at home
 	
 	
 		uh oh
 		there there was a stigma attached to it
 	
 	
 		yes and uh but nowadays it's just so common
 	
 	
 		and and a necessity
 	
 	
 		a necessity and that when i am uh at home now that i've had <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> i've stopped uh working
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that it's kind of embarrassing when i go to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX> and they ask uh when i write a check out and then they say can i have your work <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">number</ENAMEX> please and then i don't have a work <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">number</ENAMEX> to get give to them and they begin to think um i wonder if this is a good check
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah really i well i hadn't thought about it i can see i i think if they asked me for a work number i'd just write down my home number you know because that's where you work
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		right
 	
 	
 		yeah well the thing that i was thinking about uh huh you know social changes i i thought well
 		you know in a lot of different ways i i think number one just the the makeup of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> society how much it's changed i mean uh
 		uh i live in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Houston</ENAMEX> but i'm i'm in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Miami</ENAMEX> right now on business and uh i mean in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Miami</ENAMEX> it's i mean honestly <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> is almost a second <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">language</ENAMEX> now
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yes
 	
 	
 		uh you know with all the uh influx of uh  <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">South Americans</ENAMEX> and uh <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cubans</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">the Latins</ENAMEX> are are just uh
 		i i guess a majority in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Miami</ENAMEX> you know of course in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Houston</ENAMEX> uh you've got the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> so that's certainly a change in the the fabric of society uh
 	
 	
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		the other thing that i was thinking about uh the way that things have changed  so dramatically is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty or thirty years ago</TIMEX> uh
 		you know air travel was still uh and not that much in the forefront uh uh and and now i mean it's you know hardly anybody thinks anything about getting on a plane and and going cross country
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		right
 	
 	
 		plus the other thing i was thinking about was just the very fact that we're doing what we're doing tonight uh
 		you know calling a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one eight hundred</NUMEX> number having a computer hook us up uh tell us the topic of conversation uh and and we take that rather for granted
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh you know <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty years ago</TIMEX> uh  a long distance phone call was a sort of a special event
 	
 	
 		yes that's true
 	
 	
 		and and and you know and it wouldn't be uncommon for it to have been placed through an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operator</ENAMEX> up i don't know if you know i guess you maybe they did have one plus dialing uh in nineteen <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixty one</TIMEX> but uh i i'm not sure of that
 	
 	
 		right
 		no and it wasn't like my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> always watch the clock carefully when they make any long distance phone call and it's it's pennies but for them it's just a socialized behavior
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		that's right and it harks back to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the days</TIMEX> like i say when when a long distance call was an expensive uh uh  i don't want to say a frivolous but it was an extravagant uh event
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and good grief if my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> knew what my long distance bill was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every month</TIMEX> they'd have a stroke
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that's true  that's probably true
 	
 	
 		but you know it's something that i've just i mean i factor that in i mean that's that's part of my budget i mean i expect to have you know a seventy or eighty dollar phone bill and quite frankly am pleased if it's anything below that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		right me too
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		well that's good in in in our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> we all have a lot uh much more high tech compared to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten twenty years ago</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh well and you know microwaves
 	
 	
 		right unbelievable and everyone has uh multiple televisions probably and
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh i've got yeah i mean i've i'm single and i have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> televisions you know and i really they're two well
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of them is primary and the other one i turn on maybe <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times a month and i've got another one i bet i haven't turned on in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six months</TIMEX> i mean it's there you know
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i think about it too i have uh uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> telephones
 	
 	
 		right we
 		load up on all of the conveniences and they're not special to us anymore just a
 	
 	
 		um
 		that's right that's right
 	
 	
 		necessity and there's the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who don't have televisions are
 		are uh you know unusual in our society
 	
 	
 		yeah uh yeah it almost like uh you know it's a big uh
 		issue i've run across a few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> before that that you know make a make a point uh that uh the fact that they uh don't own a television and of course you know <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> look at them yeah like yeah you know but
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and it's it's it would be really quite frankly even though i am not
