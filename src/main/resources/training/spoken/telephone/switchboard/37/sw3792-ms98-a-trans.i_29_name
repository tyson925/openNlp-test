 		and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">tonight</TIMEX> he has a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> visiting who's a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pit bull</ENAMEX> so they're kind of running around chewing on things
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>

 		oh okay i see  yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh</ENAMEX> so whether um why do you have a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> what uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		why well actually we bought him for my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX>'s thirteenth birthday and he's just been with us ever since and uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		we spend more on him on his haircuts and medical attention than we do ourselves
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and that's what <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pets</ENAMEX> are like
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but he's like uh you got to have him when you come home and there's nobody here he's always here and
 	
 	
 		yeah  uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so it's nice nice to have him there
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		what about you how come you don't have a pet
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well mainly because it's just uh at this point in life i've had to be available to travel and we live in an <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> right now so um they're not even allowed here
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but uh when i was growing up i always had <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> and and then um
 		later i guess uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last few years</TIMEX> that i was at home  my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> got a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> and i learned to really appreciate <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> as well they're totally different types of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pets</ENAMEX> but um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i see how <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> are really faithful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah we were talking earlier tonight one of the ladies that's visiting with us tonight
 		her <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> is her life
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah  and she has she has a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German Shepherd</ENAMEX>  tried to tell her to get a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> and for something  and let the dog go but she's not for that she's in control  she's in control with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shepherd</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 		okay yeah that's true  yeah my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX>  i think uh finds that he really enjoys his <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> he says he's the best <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> he has but uh
 	
 	
 		but uh  yeah
 		oh yeah uh
 		it's just
 	
 	
 		i don't know that's kind of sad though
 	
 	
 		i know our dog takes a nap everyday with my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> and he jumps right up in the bed and the whole bit
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it's just  when we <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> got him  we didn't like <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> around the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> or in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but now we put up with about anything
 	
 	
 		um-hum  yeah well i've seen that there's there's a lot of um you really have to appreciate their good qualities because there there are problems  yeah they leave a lot of hair around and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah it it it's if like now you have to vacuum <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three or four</NUMEX> times <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a week</TIMEX> and it just i we didn't used to have to do that but uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah but obviously you find him worth it  or you'd get rid of him
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		yeah
 		yeah could never get rid of him  yeah you get you get attached i think that like maybe <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first year</TIMEX> of his life we didn't get attached
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		we were kind of timid about it and because we'd we'd all we'd all had dogs as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> and lost them or something and  and  we do we were afraid to but he kind of rooted his way in
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and hey i know at times when he's had emergency problems we're just a nervous wreck
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so that's that's part of being a pet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">owner</ENAMEX> these days
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i don't know but cats i don't know you can have a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> couldn't you
 	
 	
 		isn't it
 		well not this one i it's not allowed here but
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		yeah the thing i like about <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> is they're more independent you can leave them and they can take better care of themselves than a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> it seems like you know depends
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um we never had much luck with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> we had some when we lived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX> and coyotes ate them  so
 	
 	
 		oh wow yeah
 	
 	
 		we were kind of timid about having <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> and again plus we we found out that when they were kittens we really liked them and as they got older they kind of ignored us
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah they'll do that sometimes
 	
 	
 		so
 		but with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> they don't do that
 	
 	
 		so
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		when i was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX> i i raised <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">parakeets</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh really uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so those were i always thought those were good <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pets</ENAMEX> to have extremely messy  but
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah yeah oh i had goldfish but i didn't think much of those  they were they don't have any personality
 	
 	
 		yeah they're they're fun but i like to look at fish one of our favorite <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> here in town
 	
 	
 		so
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		has a humongous fish <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tank</ENAMEX> and i like to go there just uh the food's not that great but a fish <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tank</ENAMEX>'s wonderful to look at them you know floating around
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		matter fact we got <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> fighting right now  yeah
 	
 	
 		do you  well maybe i better let you go and go solve the conflict there
 	
 	
 		yeah well there's enough <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> here actually the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pit bull</ENAMEX> is from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> he lives up he lives up there but they're down visiting and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh really uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so it's kind of unusual to have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> in the house
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
