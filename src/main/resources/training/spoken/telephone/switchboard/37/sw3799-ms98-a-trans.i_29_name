 		well yes i do i have a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T I P C</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		in fact i have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of them  i have i have one that i collected the the uh ports for one at a time
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		like first i bought just the uh the central processing unit and the monitor
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">couple years later</TIMEX> i bought a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">printer</ENAMEX> and then i needed a a hard drive
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so uh there was this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> selling a a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> PC for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">four hundred dollars</NUMEX> and it had everything had the works
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		and it had the hard drive and everything
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so i bought that one instead of buying a hard hard drive for mine so now i have that one with the hard drive and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mine</ENAMEX> with no  <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the the the other one</TIMEX> with no hard drive
 	
 	
 		with a hard drive uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and what i thought i'd use them for was just to to do some work out of my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> for
 		you know <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who needed uh word processing and stuff like that
 	
 	
 		oh okay well that sounds interesting
 	
 	
 		um-hum the
 	
 	
 		my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> and i own a PC and i use <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mine</ENAMEX> for like keeping our home finances
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i also i i play several games on it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i also was doing some work for my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> doing some word processing on it for my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> and that was
 		really interesting being able to do that on the computer they were surprised at how much could be done
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		with a PC
 	
 	
 		yeah i thought i might uh
 		get some extra income somehow or another uh
 	
 	
 		i imagine if you advertise like in the
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		oh the i guess like The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Texan</ENAMEX>'s or if there's another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> up there at at your office
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you should be able to get some work that way
 	
 	
 		yeah i think i'll I'll i thought about doing that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time in fact i saw somebody else advertise in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dallasite</ENAMEX> once
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh  thought about putting an ad in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX> also but then i might just get too much business
 	
 	
 		yeah you really you have to be a little more selective
 	
 	
 		but i
 		right
 	
 	
 		you might even want to consider cold calling a couple of places for or checking the newspaper
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh
 		there might even be cottage industries now listed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX> because that's what it ends up being a cottage industry
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		well i i found a uh book once in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> that had <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> for um work at home
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh
 		you know some of them required that you have a PC but most of those wanted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> compatibles
 	
 	
 		yeah is that what yours is
 	
 	
 		and as as you know the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> PC  is not <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> compatible
 	
 	
 		i was thinking that they had recently come out with one that is
 	
 	
 		yeah they do the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">the um the Business Pro</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		ah uh-huh
 	
 	
 		which is that's what i have at work but uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i still have the problem of upgrading mine either to a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Business Pro</ENAMEX> or just going out there and buying a an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">I B M</ENAMEX> clone
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		there
 	
 	
 		then i'll have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P C</ENAMEX>'s
 	
 	
 		well they're real inexpensive to get the clones now
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i don't know if you watch your sale ads very often
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but if you do particularly Best Buy
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Circuit City</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Circuit City i</ENAMEX> saw a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">three eighty six hundred and twenty megabyte</NUMEX> hard drive with dual floppies and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh gosh the VGA color monitor
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and it also included quite a few other things i mean pieces of software and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about two thousand or less</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		well
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and that's a really nice package for about that much money
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh i</ENAMEX> saw um
 		in fact i believe the one i saw was a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three eighty six</NUMEX> also it only had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one one</NUMEX> drive though but it had a hard drive
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know some of them have the little uh the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the small</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">three and a half</NUMEX> floppy
 	
 	
 		yeah plus the the bigger one
 	
 	
 		those are nicer
 		those i prefer that over the larger floppy
 	
 	
 		um-hum i've never used one of those at all
 	
 	
 		they take up it you can get more information on the disk
 	
 	
 		you're kidding
 	
 	
 		no
 		i don't know what it is i guess because it's harder
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		that you can get more information on it than you can on the larger ones
 		and they're a lot easier to transport because it's harder to to damage them
 	
 	
 		oh i didn't i didn't know that
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		being in the harder plastic case
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so that's just a something that i've come across
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		well i'm gonna look into getting one of those I B <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> clones
 	
 	
 		well that's mostly um now that's what we have we don't have a real <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX> i don't know of too many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who afford <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBM</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but
 		right
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		we've had not a minute of trouble out of ours not a minute
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i would i would recommend it to other people
