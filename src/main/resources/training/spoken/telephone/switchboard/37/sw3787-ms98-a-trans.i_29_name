 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		so how's your lawn and garden work
 	
 	
 		well <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> it's uh  we're not doing much with it because it's kind of raining outside but or snowing actually  uh
 	
 	
 		
  
 		yeah i understand that it actually is snowing cold and wet
 	
 	
 		but um actually my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> is in the other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> um planning a um organic garden or organic treatment um
 	
 	
 		oh is he okay
 	
 	
 		yeah do you do a lot of lawn work
 	
 	
 		not so much anymore i'm i'm getting older i'm fifty <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> now so i've just uh i've sort of slowed down you know we use this rather than do it ourselves as far as fertilizing i utilize a service and i guess they do a an okay jype of job
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but uh and i've let this little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX> that lives behind us cut our grass just a little bit <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this past year</TIMEX> i think i'm gonna let him do it all this year just
 		i work uh i'm out of town quite a bit and i come home and seems like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every Friday</TIMEX> that's what i have to face on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> is doing my lawn so i just stopped doing that
 	
 	
 		well there was a time when my  <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> had had had traveled a lot and um
 		so we had a service for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first year</TIMEX> that we were in our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and the lawn looked great  um now that that he's home we don't um
 	
 	
 		right
 		
 
 	
 	
 		we haven't been treating it as well you know using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fertilizer</ENAMEX> and stuff or i guess the lawn looks okay it's just that we don't we  still have a problem with <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">weeds</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh i understand yeah we yeah we have a problem about every other year with <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">weeds</ENAMEX> it it appears that every other year a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">service</ENAMEX> can get rid of them and uh but just just about every other year they come back
 	
 	
 		and
 		i think maybe they uh spread some because they're putting it down
 	
 	
 		it's a constant battle i tell you
 	
 	
 		but the thing that he is wanting to try <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> is um using some organic treatments and
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		we're not real naturalists or anything but um
 	
 	
 		right
 		
 
 	
 	
 		what we have heard is that the  amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fertilizer</ENAMEX> that we put on our <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">lawns</ENAMEX> is about the same amount that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">farmer</ENAMEX> would put on a whole entire crop
 	
 	
 		i understand
 	
 	
 		and uh  i have a cold so i'm having a hard time
 	
 	
 		i do too so i'm have the same problem
 	
 	
 		um but uh um so he wants to try doing some you know different kind of stuff i don't really know what it involves or um um
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		at this point in time i enjoyed having the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">service</ENAMEX> when we did um
 		the only problem was they never told us when they were coming and then you find a note on your door that says <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two to three days</TIMEX> and it was never uh right right but uh
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 		with a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty five</TIMEX> dollar bill  well well we didn't use <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one year</TIMEX> before last a service because we  we had weeds like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</TIMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a row</TIMEX> and you know when you when you have a service you don't expect that so
 		we stopped and i sort of did it myself <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last then this last summer</TIMEX> i'd went back to a service and then went but went to a new service and they appear to have be doing a better job
 	
 	
 		what <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">service</ENAMEX> did you use
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawn Doctor</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawn Doctor</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and we used to use <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Plano</ENAMEX> and we switched to one that's more local
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> bought the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Plano</ENAMEX> they just didn't uh didn't do that good a job on our lawn so we changed services
 	
 	
 		yeah we tried using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chem Lawn</ENAMEX> but um our problem is our front yard is completely different from the backyard
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and um i think they just use the same stuff on everything because we've got a mixture our front yard is um all <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bermuda</ENAMEX> what's not weeds
 	
 	

 		
 
 		right
 	
 	
 		and the backyard is a mixture of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saint Augustine Bermuda</ENAMEX> and some type of uh winter grass that stays green all all winter
 	
 	
 		right either <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rye</ENAMEX> or something
 	
 	
 		yeah something like that it's real clumpy and
 	
 	
 		yeah you can see i have we have a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> in our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">yard</ENAMEX> so it's a it's you know during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX> it's bare under the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> so i've pratted a lot planted a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rye winter rye</ENAMEX> to grow because that will grow in the summertime under trees
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it's more of a shade it's a better shade grass so now as as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cold</ENAMEX> as it is out there and as rainy as it is we have you can see where we planted all the green grass but as it's in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX> because that's that's the only green area in our lawn
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh  do you do you ever do you ever double sod or um  whatever
 	
 	
 		all of our <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bermuda</ENAMEX>'s all brown
 		we have on the side yard <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">few years</TIMEX> back right
 	
 	
 		you know where they mix the seed
 	
 	
 		i'm always uh you know sometimes i'm  sometimes i'm i'm over at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Home Depot</ENAMEX> i'll just a grab a grass a thing of  of grass <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seed</ENAMEX> and put it in the old
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">spreader</ENAMEX> and just spread it real quick or throw it out in the areas where i think i need it but overall i guess we have a pretty good stand of grass they say in the summertime the hotter it is the better the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bermuda</ENAMEX> grows and course that supposedly quote will crowd out the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">weeds</ENAMEX> and everything so
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i think that's our problem is that we we just need to get it fertilized really good so that we can get the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">grass grass</ENAMEX> growing rather than the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">weeds</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so i just
 		
 
 		right how about how about <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> you have you have nice <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> in your front yard
 	
 	
 		um in the front yard not so much we have a lot
