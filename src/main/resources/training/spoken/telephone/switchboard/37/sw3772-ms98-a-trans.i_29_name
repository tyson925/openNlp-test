 
     		
 	
 		so i guess most of what happens happens in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Salt Lake</ENAMEX> which is just <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about twenty miles</NUMEX> south of us and that's quite a bit bigger and
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		they were just talking about how they had all these drive by shootings and stuff and it sounded like it was getting to be like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LA</ENAMEX> a little bit but
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		do you have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gang</ENAMEX> problems
 	
 	
 		yeah it's there they they say its getting a lot bigger uh
 	
 	
 		well i'm a school principal
 	
 	
 		oh are you so you're right familiar with all that i bet
 	
 	
 		um-hum elementary school
 		well its elementary school
 	
 	
 		oh it's a what
 	
 	
 		elementary but i have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gang</ENAMEX> problems
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		oh at that young huh you're kidding at which
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		i'm in a part of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> where there's a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gang</ENAMEX> activity and my i have through the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">sixth</NUMEX> grade
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but some of my <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">sixth</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">graders</ENAMEX> will be thirteen <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fourteen years old</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah so they're getting started
 	
 	
 		and they get recruited
 	
 	
 		oh you're kidding
 	
 	
 		so uh
 		we we have really very significant problems
 	
 	
 		i'll bet
 		my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> was just uh talking to her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> and uh i guess they said they had an F B I come <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> come to there she she works in a middle school and they were talking about how the hats signify you know <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gang</ENAMEX> and stuff like that and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh that you know it <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">some day</TIMEX> it'll eventually past but right now they say there's all kinds of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> getting beat up because of the they wear the wrong hat on the wrong <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> and that's get it's getting pretty darn scary i've got a little eighteen
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		its its surprising to me that it's that true there because  the only time i've ever been to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Utah</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i spent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a week</TIMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brigham Young</ENAMEX> campus at a workshop
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and it was very uh
 		dramatically different that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> you saw than what we see here because you had no <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minorities</ENAMEX> you know and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah that's true
 		yeah i think we've probably got it to a lesser extent i wouldn't say we're anywhere close to some of those other places probably like what you have but
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it you know they say i guess a lot of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that they the the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">gang</ENAMEX> related things they put them in jail and then they when they get out they just say get lost just don't hang around <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L A</ENAMEX> or don't hang around wherever and so they just move on to new <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">territory</ENAMEX> and where ever they can find easy pickings but
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		you can see it getting a little bit worse and worse it it's pretty sad like you say you see all these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> thirteen <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fourteen year olds</TIMEX> and you know it'll be a school night and they're out at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten eleven</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">o'clock</TIMEX> just roaming the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i just never remember that when you know it's been a while since i was in junior high or high school or even elementary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> but
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you just i just you were never out past eight or <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">nine o'clock</TIMEX> on a school <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> you know if you were even up out of bed you were lucky it seemed like and
 	
 	
 		but of course you you have a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> that are not really parenting much
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true and you know and i think when it come
 	
 	
 		you have that in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Utah</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		pardon
 	
 	
 		you have that in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Utah</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah its getting worse i you know like i say i
 	
 	
 		because i would think that big <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mormon</ENAMEX> influence there would uh
 	
 	
 		yeah with with that with that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Mormon</ENAMEX> influence it may not be as bad but we still get a lot of the two uh the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> income or the two income <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> and and i really think that's a lot of the problem its just you don't get all the the values taught in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> that you used to get
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> are left to to to do their own thing and find their own you know entertainment and stuff and i I really think that's what you're missing we miss a lot of the those good values that were taught <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX> to
 	
 	
 		well i i work in an an area of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> like my school
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about seventy five</NUMEX> percent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglo</ENAMEX> and that's very unusual in the in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Public Schools</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yo yeah
 		i would think so yeah
 	
 	
 		but it's very it's like the lowest socioeconomic Anglos
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yeah it's it's what in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South</ENAMEX> we call poor white trash
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and then the other uh significant percentage i have is <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanic</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and course that's growing
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> that i have
 		the biggest discipline problems with are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglo children</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		and i i've got lots of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anglo</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> who are just
 		not really wanted by anybody
 	
 	
 		huh not by their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> or anything
 	
 	
 		well and for example i have a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> now he checked out today
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		he's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fourteen</TIMEX> he's in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">sixth</NUMEX> grade he lived with his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mississippi</ENAMEX> he had been to he thought <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> or twelve <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mississippi</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		sheesh
 	
 	
 		then his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> now his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> aren't divorced but they don't live together in a long time his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> had a new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boyfriend</ENAMEX> who moved in who owed so much back <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> support for his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		that they couldn't afford to keep her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> anymore so they sent them here
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
  
 	
 	
 		and here he was with his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>'s pregnant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girlfriend</ENAMEX>

 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and he's just been tearing my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> up and he told me he's gonna be bad enough to be sent back to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mississippi</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		jeez
 	
 	
 		and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> they checked him out to send him back to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mississippi</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		huh
 		you're kidding you know and that and it's so sad because you i mean sure it's the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> doing it but you know who really is has the blame for that yeah
 	
 	
 		now those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>
 		yeah but
 		yeah but those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> are
 		ready fodder for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gangs</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
