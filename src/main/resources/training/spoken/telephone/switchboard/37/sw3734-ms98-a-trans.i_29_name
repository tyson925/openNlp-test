 		have something where i don't have to get up and decide what to wear because that just bugs me to death
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i know i do that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX> for school
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah but i i like to wear comfortable things like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cotton</ENAMEX> and baggy things
 	
 	
 		and sweats and things yeah when i was in school i was sweat monster i mean that's all i had was sweats and when it time to go out i didn't have anything to wear
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 		yeah i know i don't have very many dress clothes but i don't mind i don't need them yet
 	
 	
 		yeah

 		if i didn't have to have shoes i wouldn't have them
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		i just i don't know my feet bother me and
 		they're just tedious to go find shoes for me it's just i don't know i wear a size <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and it i don't know it's just the shoes i get i really either don't like them or they don't fit right and i just wish that i could just go without them
 	
 	
 		hum
 		oh wow i love shoes i always buy shoes  yeah
 	
 	
 		oh really oh
 		just the opposite
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but um
 		let's see what else do i wear
 		um if i were in a bigger market when i do get into a bigger market i'll probably go out and buy a bunch of suits and things and
 		uh where i wouldn't have to shoot and do a lot of other things and i could then i would be able to dress
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
