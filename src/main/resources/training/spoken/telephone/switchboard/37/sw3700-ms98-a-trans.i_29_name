 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh what is the last home repair that you did
 	
 	
 		oh gosh i'm trying to think well i guess ours have mostly been down at our lake <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> we built a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> built a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> down on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Cedar Creek Lake</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so
 		i guess i'd have to say that because we've kind of let this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> go
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so we had a shell built and then we did everything else
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so it was quite a bit of work
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		what have you done
 	
 	
 		well uh repaired the back fence it's uh well of course they get old you know after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about ten years</TIMEX> anyway but uh
 	
 	
 		oh yeah ours is nineteen years old
 	
 	
 		yeah the the street the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">alley</ENAMEX>'s on a kind of a slant
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and it makes all the fences tilt or or slowly you know
 	
 	
 		oh do you have to have like a retaining wall or
 	
 	
 		yeah somewhat right
 	
 	
 		yeah that makes them more difficult we we've just my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> has just um repaired repaired ours a lot it really needs to be replaced but we haven't done it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		anyway well have you done anything else
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">um</ENAMEX> had to replace the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the ridge row</TIMEX> the shingles on the corners of the the roof from all the storms and everything
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah i you know i'm wondering myself now why i checked this one because my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> is who does all the things like what you're talking about
 	
 	
 		right yeah
 	
 	
 		i haven't
 		done those things and of course
 		you know inside stuff
 		but um
 		now down at the lake we had to like put in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floors</ENAMEX> and put in
 		wall and you know do the painting and the
 		uh cut and make the like the
 		uh window sills and
 		things around the door and all that kind of stuff you know so we we did quite a bit
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh down there that i had never done or we haven't done that much in our own house
 	
 	
 		weather proofing and
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah uh we do have still have a problem down there we built us a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> story <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and the bottom story uh oh it's more like walk out basement
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and when it was built with these blocks you know these old gray blocks i think they're called <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Hadite</ENAMEX> blocks
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh we found now with some as much <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rain</ENAMEX> as we've had <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past year</TIMEX> it seeps through
 		those <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">blocks</ENAMEX> and comes into the downstairs
 		and uh so now we have bought some uh
 	
 	
 		what's uh
 	
 	
 		uh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water proofing</ENAMEX> paint
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and that's our next project the next time we go down there we've got to paint all those block walls downstairs with this waterproof paint and then hope that maybe that will do it
 		but what they should've done i think is they should have put plastic or something like that against the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> before they put the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dirt</ENAMEX> back you know when it was built
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and uh they didn't do that didn't think they'd need to
 	
 	
 		and then that it's that it's that white paint i've forgotten what it's called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tight Bond</ENAMEX> or something like that and those bricks are very porous
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and it soaks in to those bricks really well and it seals all the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> out
 	
 	
 		oh have you ever used that anywhere
 	
 	
 		just a little bit
 	
 	
 		now <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> up north that have basements i think
 	
 	
 		yeah they use it all the time
 	
 	
 		you and do you know if it if they've had good luck with it
 	
 	
 		yeah it seals the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> out
 	
 	
 		we had a hard time even finding it down here in fact you know you go in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX> and they say oh well that we don't have anything like that you know
 	
 	
 		right
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and then finally found some one somewhere that was familiar with it probably lived in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and well that's encouraging then because i haven't known that many you know there's just not many <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">basements</ENAMEX> down here are you from around here
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right
 		yeah i'm from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh okay well we're from you know <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> too so
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh but i we have a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> in this deal and he's from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">North</ENAMEX> so he was the one that and it gave us a lot more space you know it gave us double the space
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and toward the lake it looks like a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> story house you know because it gradually the back it looks like a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> story house you know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah and it's set into the earth so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh built kind of into a hill a little hill you know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so it was a good idea to give us a lot more space for the money
 	
 	
 		right uh-huh
 	
 	
 		we just uh hadn't solved our  water problem yet
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but we always
