 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yes
 	
 	
 		okay what do you do consider as as camping
 	
 	
 		well um
 		we've done a lot of tent camping that's probably the closest definition that i usually think of but um there are a couple of places in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> area that are considered environmental campsites that are
 		sort of like rustic cabins they have no um electricity and no water
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but there's usually a pot belly stove or something like that and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you can spread out sleeping bags on on uh wooden surfaces so
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		it's a pseudo <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cabin</ENAMEX> but they call it environmental camping
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum well the only camping the only camping i've done really is living in a tent we used used to go to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lake Shasta</ENAMEX> like fifteen <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> in a row
 	
 	
 		we really enjoy that
 		oh that's beautiful
 	
 	
 		and uh you know take everything up there park our <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> unload the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> and then go by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camp</ENAMEX> spot you know <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two or three</NUMEX> trips back to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> to unload everything
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh the
 	
 	
 		is it one  when you've been there is it one of those uh state <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> arrangements where
 	
 	
 		no no it was just a little camp spot that we found our you know by ourselves and it was usually in a little place called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calucci Creek</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and um you know we put up our eating tent our john tent and our sleeping tent
 		and uh slept in in the tent you know on
 	
 	
 		i don't think i've ever seen a john tent that's
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		that's more rustic camping perhaps than i've done usually where someplace where we're sort of close to
 	
 	
 		you know what it is it's actually one of those little tents that you take to the beach and you set up to change your clothes in that's what we use to put around our john
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		that's great  do you usually spend then quite a few days
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		it was like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		how do you like that i don't think i've ever been camping quite that long that seems like
 	
 	
 		uh it was
 	
 	
 		without showers and all you how how did you
 	
 	
 		well just it was it was nice for a while but after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fifteen years</TIMEX> i got tired of it
 	
 	
 		how did you enjoy that
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and then my <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next my next vacation</TIMEX> trip was to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hawaii</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so it was sort of an annual thing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every year</TIMEX> for a while
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		sounds like fun thing about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shasta</ENAMEX> too is there's so many other things that you can do
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		i've never gone anyplace else really except <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Lake Shasta</ENAMEX> camping you know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Patterson</ENAMEX> fairly close to Shasta
 	
 	
 		no <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patterson</ENAMEX>'s down by Modesto
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		it's like <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty minutes</TIMEX> away from i used to live in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oakland</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh well
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> and um
 		used to go camping all the time up there but i've lived down here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Patterson</ENAMEX> now since eighty eight
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know
 	
 	
 		there are a lot of uh camping grounds <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">county</ENAMEX> and state <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Cruz</ENAMEX> mountains south of here so
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		tends to be a good place for us to get away sometimes
 	
 	
 		um-hum do you have little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> that like to
 	
 	
 		we have one <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two year old</TIMEX> so actually we'd been camping for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a long time</TIMEX> before she was born  and just now introducing her to her it to her rather
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		it's fun for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> though isn't it
 	
 	
 		yeah they really enjoy it i think that she's at an age now you're not as concerned about where she's going to run off to she can pretty much stay close and
 	
 	
 		you know
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i think her first camping trip she was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eight months old</TIMEX> so
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		hopefully she'll learn to enjoy it as much as we do
 	
 	
 		um-hum well i'm ready to go camping again i i did go camping in a in a camper on a pickup <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">deer</ENAMEX> hunting
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a weekend</TIMEX> so know lived in a camper on that
 	
 	
 		um-hum that's that's kind of fun we did that once in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yosemite</ENAMEX> too
 	
 	
 		yeah that's that's not too bad at least you're inside you don't have to worry about the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bears</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		right that was one good reason in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yosemite</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> in the camper next to us had gotten hit by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bears</ENAMEX> that night so we were glad we were a little more secure
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		um-hum um-hum but
 	
 	
 		yes in fact i've never been camping at all in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yosemite</ENAMEX> outside of the uh the camper arrangement i know that they have tent cabins
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		that sort of remind me of the environmental cabin situation but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		it it it would be fun to go camping up there again i haven't been up to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yosemite</ENAMEX> for God i don't know how many years i would love to go up there again
 	
 	
 		yeah it's a beautiful place i think i worry that it's changing so much so quickly the valley has become so popular
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah i know if they say the road up there is terrible now you know with all the traffic
 	
 	
 		do you remember it a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a long time ago</TIMEX> i don't know if you ever went there like back in the fifties or
 	
 	
 		it was a long time ago that i went there but i've only been there once
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know
 	
 	
 		my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX> used to tell me about trips that we took when we were little um and that at that time there really weren't delegated designated campsites so um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> would basically come as soon as they could to stakeout their their terrain and
 		put themselves basically anywhere they could find a spot so you go to bed at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> and have a few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> around you and wake up in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX> and just be surrounded  there were no limitations in other words to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">campsite</ENAMEX> there were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> everywhere
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah yeah but it's beautiful though you look outside in the dark and you see all the stars all the stars up there and everything compared to uh you know living in the city
 	
 	
 		it's a little bit better arrangement today
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
