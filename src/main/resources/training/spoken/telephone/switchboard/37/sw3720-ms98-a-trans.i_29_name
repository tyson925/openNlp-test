 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> let's see he coaches <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">basketball</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brian</ENAMEX> um so he spends time doing that with him planning and um practicing out side
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um he's a real sports kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> so he plays tennis with with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> we all kind of play <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">tennis</ENAMEX> as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> except the baby plays on the play ground we take turns with her um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh let's see we have a computer and we do a lot of things with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> on the computer um
 		uh let's see what else we do oh i suppose we watch a little TV together we really don't watch i think as much TV as a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> we don't have <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HBO</ENAMEX> we do get the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Disney</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> have the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nintendo</ENAMEX> which they play and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> sometimes joins them with that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh my little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jennifer</ENAMEX> likes to do crafty things and i'll take some time and do that with her
 		and of course we always read a bed time story at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> and even the the older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> sometimes sit down and and will join in and listen to a story um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh</ENAMEX> that's neat
 	
 	
 		basically the story <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> because my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> doesn't have he gets home from work <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">late</TIMEX> or whatever and and usually once in a while he'll read the story to the little one but that's basically my job um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		so do you find it difficult to find time or is it pretty natural uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it is it is hard because you know at the end of your <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX> you want time for yourself and and it and that's kind of cutting into your your time
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> getting older now on the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekends</TIMEX> they get to the bed like at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> which really is late but you know on school <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">nights</TIMEX> the two older ones get to bed <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about nine</NUMEX> they go upstairs at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">nine</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and um now <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this weekend</TIMEX> we'll have a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby sitter</ENAMEX> come and uh my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> and i will go out to dinner and come home and um probably not too late maybe maybe <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brian</ENAMEX> will still be up and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		spend some time with him but it is it's really hard you have to be a very unselfish <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> to to spend a lot of time with your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> i think
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah do you work during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the day</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh no i don't work i <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> um i had a little part time job in a private um high school tutoring um high school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> with learning disabilities that was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two days a week</TIMEX> and even just those <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two days</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		just seemed like it was a lot i don't know how i admire <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that that can do it all but with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> and laundry and keeping the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> the way i i want it kept it is hard
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		i can imagine yeah
 	
 	
 		um even just finding the time to do the grocery shopping and everything and that's another thing i'll take one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> with me grocery shopping <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">um</ENAMEX> usually on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the weekend</TIMEX> and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		that's kind of like a special time for just myself and my little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girl</ENAMEX> or myself and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> and and they'll be my helper and then they'll get to pick out some of the favorite <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">snacks</ENAMEX> that they get to pick out so try to do things like that but it you know it's it's uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and then of course they have a pretty um busy social calendar too  you fit it in with all that the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">that</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah so what do you feel are the current trends in the way <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> spend time in general you know in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i i think a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> sit sit their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> in front of the TV and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HBO</ENAMEX> and rent movies and and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		kind of leave them to their own means um i think you know it's very very easy to fall into that trap and i'm not um totally innocent of that because there's times when you just stay here watch a tape but um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um i think different parts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> i think in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Plano</ENAMEX> and maybe this area in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> there's a lot of community activities that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> could join in with their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids people</ENAMEX> are real
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		sports conscious and really get involved with their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> sports activities and you know but um
 	
 	
 		oh that's good yeah
 		yeah well <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> are facing a challenge i know that with i'm a newlywed and we're you know thinking about having <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> sometime in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next couple of years</TIMEX> and
 	
 	
 		what um-hum
 		um-hum and it's it's very hard because when you get used to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> salaries it's very hard to to cut back to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> and um um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but you know if you have the type of job i have a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> that's a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurse</ENAMEX> and she can pick her <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> and that's a a great career i i wish i would have gone into uh nursing  because she has such a flexible schedule but it's very hard to uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		spend time with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and uh and your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		do everything at once
 	
 	
 		yeah but i do feel like it's important that you make the time for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> because
 	
 	
 		well i think it's a big it's a big um responsibility you just don't have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> so that you can continue the lifestyle you had when you were single
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		when you have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> you have to say now this is different and you do have to give things up i i personally feel that it is extremely important to be with your own <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		for the at least for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first two years</TIMEX> of their lives i mean if you can possibly swing it because they
 	
 	
 		yeah
