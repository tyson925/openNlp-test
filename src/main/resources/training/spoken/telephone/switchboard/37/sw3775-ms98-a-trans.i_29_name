 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
  
 		yes

 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		um
 	
 	
 		but we're <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> blocks from everything you need including a small mall
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and lots of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX> within walking distance but uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		your <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> is a big city
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Austin</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about a million</NUMEX> people
 	
 	
 		oh i guess it is big
 	
 	
 		so it's it's it's it's it's a nice town it's real kind of a laid back place and uh kind of an environmentally conscious city
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		um-hum um-hum well my i have also have a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> bedroom house
 		uh we have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bathrooms</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">upstairs</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> downstairs
 		which makes it nice because um it's right off the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garage</ENAMEX> so when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gene</ENAMEX>'s working on his <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> he can come in and take a shower without going through the rest of the house
 		and then um
 		i have a it's in a small <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of like um <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight thousand</NUMEX> people

 		i've heard of it i've never been there
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah and it's on a cul-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">de</ENAMEX>-sac um
 		which makes it nice because there's no through traffic you know about all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> that come in here are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that just live right in here
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah i like that feature about where we live that was one of the reasons we bought this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> is because there's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only six</NUMEX> street <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> on the on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> so
 	
 	
 		yeah it makes a lot nicer space i say i imagine you have little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> right
 	
 	
 		no no  not at all i have uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX> and he's <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty almost twenty one</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh okay well i have one also but he's he'll be <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty seven</TIMEX> in uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February</TIMEX>
 		so but anyhow i have lots of little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbor kids</ENAMEX> and they all love me and i just just worship them they can come in my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> i have candy for them and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cookies</ENAMEX> for them
 		you know so i'm just like their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aunt</ENAMEX> Rosy
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh we still have
 		there are actually no <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> right in the immediate neighborhood but uh we just moved here <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about two years ago</TIMEX> and we still have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> from the old neighborhood which is only a few blocks they come to visit they expect  brownies
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		oh yeah  it's
 	
 	
 		yeah they'll they'll stay till you bake a bunch but uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		but anyhow as far as decorating my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and everything too i've uh stenciled uh practically
 		in every <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> in my house
 		which um it looked like it would be very hard to do but it ended up being really easy and it just really just makes the rooms
 		you know i stenciled right above the right below the ceiling line on the walls like it looks something like a wallpaper border but it's actually is a stencil
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right
 		my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> and i've never tried any stenciling uh we've always thought we she wanted to anyway
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh somehow i feel like this particular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX> doesn't call for stenciling we've done some wallpapering and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> really likes to paint different colors and things so
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		that seems to be i think she ought to be a paint <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX> she's just in the wrong career field but uh we watch <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">This Old House</ENAMEX> faithfully on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturdays</TIMEX> and
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		do all of our own uh decorating work and repair work around the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and yard work
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		sometimes it's
 	
 	
 		well you can't afford to have it done you know plus it's fun i enjoy you know going out and working in the yard and
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		you know just doing everything decorating the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> up and changing it in fact i just bought a
 		a large bird cage i had seen in magazines how they were decorating them that not that i want a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bird</ENAMEX> i don't want a bird
 		but i have decorated it up with <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>
 		and i got a little <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">nest</ENAMEX> in there that looks like it's got <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> little <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> in there and i've got some dolls sitting in there
 		it looks really really cute
 	
 	
 		yeah my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> just remodeled since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> she's remodeled our bedroom
 		with all new sheets comforters things like that and paint and she did a wallpaper border
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		new drapes uh looks it's just a whole different different atmosphere in there looks kind of like i like to hang out in there now during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the daytime</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah it's kind of fun to change too isn't it
 	
 	
 		it's just
 		yeah she picked a for the walls she picked a fudgesicle color
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fudgesicle</ENAMEX> color no
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		which well i thought well i don't know if this'll work but when she finished
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it really looked good
 	
 	
 		yeah it probably goes with a lot of different colors too
 	
 	
 		yeah i don't think she meant for it to go with anything other than just fudgesicle walls and the ends the white trim
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um just to give it a little bit different look than what it's always been or been lately anyway so
