 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mark i</ENAMEX> was wondering if you had any uh what do what do you like to do in your spare time
 	
 	
 		uh i like to play my guitar a lot and uh i i do a little bit of uh wood working out in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garage</ENAMEX> a lot
 	
 	
 		really have you had lessons guitar lessons
 	
 	
 		uh not really very formal i i took uh some classical guitar lessons from my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX> once but they weren't very good
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh so i didn't really learn much from that i i generally learn how to play songs just by ear i i listen to it and and figure it out myself and then go from there
 	
 	
 		huh well have you ever wanted to play in a band
 	
 	
 		yeah i was i was in several bands when i was
 		some what younger and then i just kind of got tired of it because they were all a little <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pig</ENAMEX> headed and
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		self centered didn't care about anybody else but themselves
 	
 	
 		well and bad hours too
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah that too
 	
 	
 		huh  well i um i like to play the piano i mean i like to dabble in it i don't play very well but uh i wouldn't say that was a hobby so much as um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i usually
 		you know i do some crafts and things but mostly out of necessity like if it's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas time</TIMEX> or a birthday or uh we bought a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX> not too long ago and i needed some decorations and things for the walls and so i've done some
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um crafts and things to hang up but i don't do it i don't think so much out of enjoyment now do you do your woodworking for enjoyment
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um yeah i i usually do my wood working for stuff that i want and for just so that i don't have to you know it's it's cheaper to to build it yourself than it is to go out and buy it from a furniture store
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so i i i do it for monetary and personal enjoyment it's it's it's it's an accomplishment to finish something that you that you made by yourself
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that's true is is it one of those uh things that you have to have expensive equipment for
 	
 	
 		um it really depends on what you're making uh if if you're making a piece of furniture yeah you'd generally need a a good you know table saw and everything uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		if it's just some little old knickknack or something you can usually get away with a like a hand held saw or something like that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		hum
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		it's a it's a lot of fun you just you have to be careful so you don't like go lopping your fingers off or anything
 	
 	
 		sounds like it
 	
 	
 		my my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX>'s gotten into the to the the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wood</ENAMEX> working stuff here lately and he's trying to make a a uh jewelry box for my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandmother</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> and uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		he didn't get it finished because he kept screwing up the lid for it but uh
 		he uh he doesn't know all the the safety rules and everything so i had to kind of keep him from taking off a finger or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> and there's a couple of things he's done that i've like near had nearly had a heart attack over
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it's like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dad</ENAMEX> you're doing it wrong
 	
 	
 		that's awful
 	
 	
 		you're gonna hurt yourself yeah but uh
 	
 	
 		that's pretty funny well i uh since my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> started to school um they have to have costumes it seems like every little bit they have like a pirate day and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pilgrim</ENAMEX> feast and things and so i've done some
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Halloween</TIMEX> and
 	
 	
 		right so i've done some sewing and things but uh you know to meet the demands of all these costumes but um and i enjoy it in a way but um
 		it seems like we keep busy you know at work and at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> and i volunteer a lot of places so that in my spare time i like to rest  and read
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i i work i work out of the i work at a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renaissance</ENAMEX> festival down in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Waxahachie</ENAMEX> and uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i have to make my own costume for that out there and uh
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		it uh tries your patience sometimes because the the patterns aren't always the best things in the world they they draw you a pattern on a on a a piece of paper and you're supposed to like you know figure out all the dimensions and everything yourself and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		kind of helps if you can either get somebody else to do it or find somebody else that already has a good pattern and just copy it
 	
 	
 		well and there's a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that enjoy sewing
 	
 	
 		yeah like my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mom</ENAMEX> sew has sewn for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> and years
 	
 	
 		hum but i have um you know done some knitting and some other crafts like that but not um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know not so much because it's all so expensive to go and collect all of the material and then the tools you need
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one one one</NUMEX> thing that is a lot of fun is to do calligraphy
 	
 	
 		uh-huh i like that
 	
 	
 		i i took <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a couple</NUMEX> classes in when i was in high school and stuff like that it's it's a lot of fun and it's fairly inexpensive you go out and get you two dollar pen that lasts <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">forever</TIMEX> and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		and it's
 		right and it's functional so that you're always needing you know it's nice to do your <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> cards
 	
 	
 		yeah you can do it yourself do your <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> cards and invitations and things like that
 	
 	
 		yeah sounds good
 	
 	
 		or even something you just wanna frame and stick on your wall
 	
 	
 		yep that's right we have enjoyed that seems like um we've done a lot
 		too well has it has it been snowing that way wherever you are
 	
 	
 		uh i i live in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Richardson</ENAMEX> just outside of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> it snowed snowed just
