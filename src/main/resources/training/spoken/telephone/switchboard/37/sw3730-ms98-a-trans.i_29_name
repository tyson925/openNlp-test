 		i don't know what do you think about it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		do they have a lot of those up in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Utah</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh they do actually there's quite a few and getting more and more seems like
 	
 	
 		yeah they're they're growing really really fast i remember uh i i worked with a bunch of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> uh uh for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX> and she was trying and one of the ladies there who drove me there she was trying to put her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> in child care and it was the the competition is pretty fierce you know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh some places uh charge a lot of money and offer all sorts of amenities
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		some <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">places</ENAMEX> are like really cheap but uh you know they like have a it's like a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> or something an old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> they just hire a bunch of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and have a big <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">yard</ENAMEX> and let the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> play back there
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		play <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">all day</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah and
 	
 	
 		so what was she looking for when she was out around
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well she was um she was looking for something cheap obviously uh someone to take care of her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX> but that at the same time she didn't want you know some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that were like a bunch of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teenagers</ENAMEX> you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		just out there working because some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> do that they'll just go to high school or something get some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> who work for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">five dollars</NUMEX> an hour and get them out there and that's all they really care about you know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh some places like uh they have uh they set up a gym you know like a jungle <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">gym</ENAMEX> and uh they they emphasize like athletics and stuff like that but those kinds of places get pretty expensive and it's really for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">yuppies</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		well my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> i mean they they have a prepared you know little school <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> type lessons for them and stuff but
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> sometimes are so rowdy and want to be outside that that stuff doesn't go over too well she
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		she's not too set on the whole thing i mean it's a job for her she has to take it but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh she's not too she'd rather almost just get a somebody she knows you know personally and have them babysit her you know her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		hum
 		yeah my uh that's that's what uh what my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mom</ENAMEX> you know thinks is the best way to do it you know if you know someone uh who's willing to take care of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> who's willing to take care of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> that that uh you know that you can trust
 	
 	
 		if she had to
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that's probably the best way to do it because sometimes you know i i don't know if you saw the thing on uh some news i think on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX> one time they was showing how <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> the some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> were just smacking the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> around you know
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah her
 		yeah well that was and that was what really kind kind of scared us is because well we we have a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> and she goes with her but she's in a different class and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> will poke her head downstairs and she'll see the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX> screaming at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> and stuff and i'm just going wait <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a minute</TIMEX> you know i mean
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		um
 		
 
 	
 	
 		she's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> you you know <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eighteen months</TIMEX> old
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah
 	
 	
 		you can't be screaming at them too much but
 	
 	
 		yeah really
 	
 	
 		it seems uh i don't know i was pretty
 		i'm not i i don't like them i think
 	
 	
 		how many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> do you have
 	
 	
 		we just have one just a little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eighteen months</TIMEX> and
 	
 	
 		just one
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i said i it's the only reason you know she the only reason we have my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> working is that she can work with her she can go to work with her otherwise it's
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		is it expensive up there
 	
 	
 		well we i think they usually charge about twelve bucks a day so i think we're pretty cheap i heard once that like out in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX> it could be upwards of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">four hundred dollars</NUMEX> a month and here you and yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah it it can get real expensive i remember i worked at a place in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelsat</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> also house <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WJLA</ENAMEX> and they had a it was the child care <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> was on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the floors in the building
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh they would charge i think the rate was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">eight hundred dollars</NUMEX> a month for child care but the convenience was that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX> was in the same <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> as you were and it was a and
 	
 	
 		gee
 		yeah
 		but you know the kind of money you have to make to make that even worthwhile i mean you know to pay <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight hundred</NUMEX> bucks out of your income
 	
 	
 		oh yeah  oh yeah
 		oh yeah but uh the the child care <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> was really top notch they had uh the where the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> were was i mean the right above it was an executive uh room for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">WJLA</ENAMEX> right below it was an executive <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WJLA</ENAMEX> and it's all glass
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		so i mean there's really nothing they couldn't do they could do that uh you know that nobody could see you know so everything was pretty much under uh you know uh supervision
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and since uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> was built on a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> on park land they had plenty of land to go out and just play around if they wanted to and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah i like the idea of having it on site something like that i think that's
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i mean you can go visit your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> you know and see see how they're doing
 	
 	
 		yeah go have lunch with them and stuff like that but that sounds pretty cool
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but
 	
 	
 		but anyway well i think we got our <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three minutes</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah hey well it's been good talking to you
 	
 	
 		
 
 		hey it was a pleasure talking to you too take care bye bye
 	
 	
 		all right see you later bye bye
