 
     		
 	
 		we could talk about my favorite subject
 	
 	
 		
 
 		cooking and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> huh what do you like to cook
 	
 	
 		food
 		uh i don't cook a lot actually i've just started baking so i'm kind of interested in cakes and muffins and stuff like that but i can't seem to get them exactly right
 		so just trying to perfect some things i don't know i tried to make an apple <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sauce cake</ENAMEX> which i will never ever try to make again
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it was horrible i don't know if the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cake</ENAMEX> was horrible or if i made it horrible
 	
 	
 		oh dear
 		oh probably not i have uh a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bread</ENAMEX> recipe that's real easy that everyone always really does like that uh doesn't require kneading the dough
 	
 	
 		hum
 		oh hey
 	
 	
 		and it's oh it is it's wonderful it's and what's funny is that you use uh bran All <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Bran</ENAMEX> and it looks like it's a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wheat bread</ENAMEX>  but it's actually All <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Bran</ENAMEX> and flour and uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		hum
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know it's regular types that you know you use and that sort of thing and you let it rise and you can let it rise in the refrigerator and you can punch it down and then uh make your rolls and they really are good and they're so easy to do
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">wow um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		that it seems like every time that we have a dinner <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> or that uh we're going some place where everybody's supposed to bring something and they've had my rolls before they always ask me to bring those rolls
 	
 	
 		um-hum they request it
 		i haven't gotten any requests yet actually we i had a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> party at uh my office
 		and i made the tuna fish <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sandwiches</ENAMEX> and everyone i mean i'm i think everyone knows how to make tuna fish so that'd be easy for me to make and i can't go wrong with it
 		and so i made it and i used <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">celery seed</ENAMEX> in my do you use <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">celery seed</ENAMEX> in your tuna fish
 	
 	
 		no i haven't
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> and i i just thought it was so strange because i've never i thought that that's what celery <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seed</ENAMEX> was for was for tuna fish
 	
 	
 		oh how funny
 	
 	
 		and so but everyone really really loved the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">tuna fish</ENAMEX> and they just couldn't get over the fact that i used celery in it and it just surprised me celery and and onion and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well see i i've always used celery i mean i've used celery before but i've never used the celery <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seed</ENAMEX> in it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		oh yeah it's great uh just like um really fine onions and green pepper and the celery seed
 	
 	
 		well what else do you put in it besides the celery seed
 	
 	
 		and i used like <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh Miracle Whip</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salad dressing</ENAMEX> instead of the actual <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mayonnaise</ENAMEX> because i really don't like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mayonnaise</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Helman</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mayonnaise</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but if you use a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salad</ENAMEX> dressing which is kind of uh you know kind of a i guess a tart taste then it comes out really good but i was uh it was the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time i've
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i've ever found out that that
 		nobody else used celery seed i feel so silly but
 	
 	
 		well see i've never put bell pepper in tuna fish either
 	
 	
 		yeah i
 	
 	
 		isn't that funny
 	
 	
 		yeah that's weird
 	
 	
 		i was brought up with tuna fish it was made where you put in uh oh chopped hard boiled <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX> which it now is a no no with cholesterol
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		right uh-huh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and uh you know chopped up <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">uh dill pickles</ENAMEX> and that sort of thing the standard old tuna fish
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah yeah i would i would put that too i just didn't have those things like i don't think i had <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">that night</TIMEX> or something but i would have put eggs i would have put in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX> in there also
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		but isn't that interesting so you you use bell pepper and onion and celery seed i'll have to try that
 	
 	
 		but that's strange
 		and celery seed
 		do you use a regular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mayonnaise</ENAMEX> or
 	
 	
 		sometimes i do sometimes i use <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Miracle Whip</ENAMEX> it depends on what i have  and sometimes if i'm using like regular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mayonnaise</ENAMEX> to spice it up a little bit i'll use a little bit of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mustard</ENAMEX> with it
 	
 	
 		the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salad</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Miracle Whip</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah i do that also um-hum just to put a little zing in it or something
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah but not a bunch but enough to make it have a little bit more flavor
 	
 	
 		oh no
 		what
 		what else do i like i love barbecue anything barbecue i'll eat
 	
 	
 		
  
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		i like uh barbecue <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> back ribs
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um um</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh and and they're so easy to do if you uh have a good barbecue <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sauce</ENAMEX> and you just cook them very very slowly in the oven and it's not hard to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cook</ENAMEX> like some meals are
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah hum
 	
 	
 		and it's not of course it's messy to eat that's the disadvantage and uh i make lasagna from scratch and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> really like my lasagna and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i like to make that too i make that once in a while
 	
 	
 		and so um sometimes i'm requested to make that
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		or and that's and that's not too hard to do because you can do it in advanced and just bake it
 	
 	
 		it's not really as long as you have all the ingredients it's just the layering really and and not breaking the uh the the uh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pasta</ENAMEX> is the hardest part probably
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		then i have a wonderful recipe for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">strawberry pie</ENAMEX> it just takes forever but it's uh when the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">strawberries</ENAMEX> are nice and big and fresh and yummy
 	
 	
 		but um yeah
 		um
 		do you make a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cheese</ENAMEX> cake
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um um-hum i do but this one is basically it's like a normal pie crust but then you use this sort of uh it's a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cream cheese</ENAMEX> um
 	
 	
 		hum
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> layering but you use thin it out a little bit uh or make it a little fluffier and you put uh line the whole pie crust with that
 	
 	
 		um
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and so it's sort of like in a way uh using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cheese cake</ENAMEX> and you know but but it's not a real <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cheese cake</ENAMEX> and then you
 	
 	
 		um yeah and you just put the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">strawberries</ENAMEX>
