 
     		
 	
 		okay you ready to discuss the the topic
 	
 	
 		
 
 		what's the topic
 	
 	
 		okay the topic is social changes and discuss social changes  in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> and how they relate or how they differ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> than they were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten fifteen</NUMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty years ago</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		are you ready for that  okay  pardon me
 	
 	
 		you bet i'll let you lead out
 		i'll let you lead out
 	
 	
 		okay well uh there's uh it's kind of an interesting interesting topic and one that i think is quite fascinating because
 		uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">couple of years ago</TIMEX> i guess uh not very not many not very long ago seemed like the whole world not just the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> but the whole world was kind of in a standstill where everyone was
 		basically in a
 		you know a very comfortable position so to say even though the the cold war was was in full swing
 		you know you had the the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russians</ENAMEX> against the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Communists</ENAMEX> against the Free World
 		and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last couple of years</TIMEX> things have tranged dramatically  not only on the political front but also on the economic front where
 		uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">couple of years ago</TIMEX> we had uh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> uh was a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the leading powers and one of the strongest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nations</ENAMEX> in the world as far as economics were concerned and now we're
 		having a very tough time in a recessionary period we're also have a very humongous trade deficit and uh
 		and that's kind of frightening also you know <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of years ago ten fifteen fifteen ten fifteen years ago</TIMEX> an individual going into a career could expect to have that career basically throughout their whole life
 		and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty years ago</TIMEX> that was that was basically it whereas now we're expected to have a career change every you know <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every couple years</TIMEX> and possibly <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five four to five</NUMEX> career changes throughout our lifetime
 		and so i think uh
 		you know things there's been an awful lot of social change lately and a lot and uh
 	
 	
 		i think one of the things that's interesting to me is if you look particularly at the political changes is that the  they seem to be social they seem to be economically driven also

 		so if you look at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> and what's happened over there i think the change in Communism was as a result of the economic problems that they were experiencing
 		i think was i look at the economic problems in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> right now one of the things you wonder is what's that going to do to us
 	
 	
 		true
 	
 	
 		i think the other kind of changes like job changes and those kinds of things i mean i think it's great that you can have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three or four</NUMEX> different careers in your life i think it must've been terribly boring to go through your life doing just one thing for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fifty years</TIMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">forty</NUMEX> years
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 		yes yes
 	
 	
 		so i think that opportunity for job change in the fact that that aspects changing
 	
 	
 		true true
 	
 	
 		and the uncertainty of whether you're gonna have a job is not as good but the fact that you really can make major changes in your life and jobs
 	
 	
 		um-hum  well do you do you think that's good or bad
 	
 	
 		i think it's great
 	
 	
 		you think that's great
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		that something yeah because a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> seem to stagnate once they get into position they they're very comfortable they lose the ability to learn
 		and the in a sense become unteachable they think they know all there is to know in their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">area set path</ENAMEX> and you know come in and put my time in from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> and
 		when that's over with that's that's it without even giving a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> thought to  advancing their education or getting extracurricular
 		um education and and i think that's an excellent opportunity for us to to expand ourselves also
 	
 	
 		i think one of the problems with with education in as it relates to this though is that i don't know that education education is prepared to help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> make those changes
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it still seems a lot of the training and education that goes on is gearing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> towards a profession
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and not giving them the skills and whatever those skills are necessary to make those job changes which i think's gonna be a hard thing for for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to face
 	
 	
 		yes i agree with that i agree with that so i i believe that uh an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> should really learn how to to learn
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		learn how to adapt learn how to grow in the in their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">college</ENAMEX> or whatever education they might take so that that's good that's good
 	
 	
 		there probably needs to be some training on how to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">to to</NUMEX> to adjust to these changes as they come about
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		i mean if you look at the the high unemployment rate <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">right now</TIMEX> and you look at <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who are in those situations i don't know that they have good coping skills or a lot of them even ideas of how to make those changes now
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so it seems to me that while those changes are taking place maybe we're not well preparing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to make the changes with them
 	
 	
 		yeah i i i read a few articles off in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX> and some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publications</ENAMEX> where stress uh for those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that are laid off and also for those people
 		that are not laid off but were threatened with a layoff and threatened with a reduction in their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> is extremely high right now that <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX> is a very prominent factor in the work place
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and it affects
