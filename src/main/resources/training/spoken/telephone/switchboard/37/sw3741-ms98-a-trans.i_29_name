 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		family with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> or
 	
 	
 		uh yes in fact i'm i'm i've got grandchildren
 	
 	
 		oh do you
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so what do you find yourself spending most of your time doing with them
 	
 	
 		uh spending uh
 		oh just visiting back and forth fortunately when your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> get up in their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirties</TIMEX>
 		they finally grow up  you get to enjoy them
 	
 	
 		that's true and then you just get to spoil the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandkids</ENAMEX> and send them home right that's what my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mom</ENAMEX> always says
 	
 	
 		right right right
 		yeah do you have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah i have one little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> she's just <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> and a half
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and i think about all we ever do is just pick up after her it seems like
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		she's not too good at just sitting down and doing any one thing her attention span's <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">only a couple of minutes</TIMEX> i think and then its on to the new little mess
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		oh yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		i'm sure you remember those days
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		but and we try and sit and read to her she's really good she'll bring us books so we read a lot of books to her and stuff but
 		i can't they got to be just a lot of pictures and not too much else
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		or else she loses her loses a attention the attention's not that interesting to her for very long
 	
 	
 		yeah i i think one of the very most important
 		was i i guess about the most important thing that you can do for small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> like that is to read to them
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> and get them to love books
 		before they ever start to preschool
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		uh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i was very fortunate in having an older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> who read to me constantly and uh so i was i went to school in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the days</TIMEX> before public kindergarten
 	
 	
 		uh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but uh uh i had practically all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fairy</ENAMEX> stories read to me before i started to school so
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh</ENAMEX> and it
 	
 	
 		uh uh i made great strides and i i'm sure you'll experience the same thing
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah i i uh my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mom</ENAMEX> used to spend quite a bit of time and
 		i i've carried it through i love to read <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">now and</TIMEX> and uh that's why we've we've made it a point whenever she brings us a book that we don't you know we always sit down with her right then and read it so that we try and instill that on her that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		that uh it's something good to do but
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah it's it's kind of cute because she'll just come and she'll just start you know kind of not whining but just letting us know that it she wants us to read this book and it's the same <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> over and over and over again it seems like but
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but i guess like you say she it's something so she at least she gets in the habit
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but
 		yeah we uh  my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> works at a day care part time and she's able to take her with her there but she she works with a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> you know it's they drop them off at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">six in the morning</TIMEX> and then pick them up at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">six at night</TIMEX> and
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		then they're proud if their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> are in bed by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">eight</TIMEX> you know which means they only get to spend <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about two hours a day</TIMEX> with them and i just kind of wonder
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know there's
 		there's a lot to be said with with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> you know for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> spending time with their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> that's for sure
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		other than just you know putting them in front of the TV or something like that
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		i have a kind of a hard time with that but
 		it's uh i think it's fair to say you get more of a there's a lot more love and they don't have to go elsewhere to find the the attention and stuff if the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> are spending time doing stuff with them
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so
 		
 
 		how many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> did you have do you have
 	
 	
 		i have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three three</NUMEX> yeah
 	
 	
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> and how many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandchildren</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh eight
 	
 	
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> oh that's good
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah we uh my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mom</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> just well they have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandchildren</ENAMEX> now each of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> each we each have one but
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		they're they're fond of like i say they like to keep them for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a couple of hours</TIMEX> but boy when they send them <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> with us they sure you know it cause they have been spoiled to death
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		they like them but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh they they're looking forward they like i say they've been looking forward to the time when they could just send them <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> with their with their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> as opposed to having to keep us all the time
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 		so
 	
 	
 		i i think one of the hardest things to do with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> is to be consistent and and uh in your discipline cause <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">some days</TIMEX> when you're feeling pretty good you wouldn't mind letting them get away with murder then on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> when you don't feel well
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		yeah  well how do you do
 	
 	
 		what do you mean you didn't do this
 	
 	
 		
 
 		how did you do that i mean you know as far as having to tell them no or slapping their hands or something like that that's that's what we struggle with
 	
 	
 		oh oh gee i i i i did a lot of the wrong things i'm sure
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but uh uh that that was the hardest thing i found was to be consistent and if
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i i tried to keep as few rules but well really about the only rule i had was they couldn't play on the top <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bunk</ENAMEX> and they had to confine their eating to the kitchen
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah  those are the ones that save you a lot of time and energy
 	
 	
 		so
 		yeah yeah and uh so
 		uh
 		i don't know they all turned around out okay so
 	
 	
 		yeah well that's the important thing and they probably appreciate all you did for them so
 	
 	
 		well i i think so and um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		we're just like i say we just all i keep hearing is from my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mom</ENAMEX> is just you wait you know you'll get all that you ever gave so  i could be in trouble but
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i say they they're a handful that's for sure we i just last night uh she
 	
 	
 		yeah
