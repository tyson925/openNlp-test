 
     		
 	
 		um i would take it that you probably read quite a bit if you picked this category
 	
 	
 		okay
 		yeah well i picked every almost every category well they said you well they said pick fifteen categories and there wasn't really all that much i was into i mean i'm interest interest of course i do read a lot but that's uh
 	
 	
 		oh you'll talk about anything right
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but i i also picked gardening and  i mean i tried to talk about that for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five minutes</TIMEX> i don't really garden very much  but books i could talk about you know forever i
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh me too what kind of books do you read
 	
 	
 		well mostly fiction and um i i the nonfiction i like are are the usually the crime stories
 	
 	
 		i see
 	
 	
 		see and um
 	
 	
 		we're gonna get along well  well i like fiction uh matter of fact well my favorite would be horror type stories such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen King</ENAMEX> and such
 	
 	
 		oh you too
 		oh see now i don't like i don't like those types i i can't relate to stuff like that it's so weird you know it's
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that that's why i read it because i don't have to relate to it
 	
 	
 		i
 		yeah well i like uh i i like a book i could
 		in some way relate to and and that's i don't know it's so off the wall most of that stuff you know you really i you can't really believe it i mean you it's hard to to to read it and and really think that this could really happen it's it's i don't know it's not
 		believable to me at all
 	
 	
 		well thank goodness  believe me
 	
 	
 		well well that's true i mean you don't have to read a book and believe that you know stuff can happen but i don't know i guess i just go more for realism
 	
 	
 		
 
 		have you read <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Firm</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh yeah it's very good
 	
 	
 		oh that was one of the best books i've read for a long time
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah that was good i read that oh quite a while ago
 	
 	
 		and um see another one i just read that i thought was really excellent was uh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jurassic Park</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh by um oh  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Crichton right Crichton</ENAMEX> now now what is that about is that uh an espionage thing
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Crichton</ENAMEX> or something like that have you read that one
 		no it's about um this multimillionaire that has decided that he wants to start a theme <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> and it's about dinosaurs
 		well they've taken <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA material</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dinosaurs</ENAMEX> and and
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		really recreated dinosaurs
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and well it's a little far fetched also but um it was really an excellent book it held my interest have you read any of his other things
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		yes i have but i  <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Terminal Man</ENAMEX> was that was that one of his
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Terminal Man</ENAMEX> yeah i've seen seems like i've seen the movie
 	
 	
 		he he writes stuff his writing books are similar to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robin Cook</ENAMEX>'s have you read any <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robin Cook</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i've read a couple of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robin Cook</ENAMEX>'s
 	
 	
 		yeah and they're sort of similar you know the in the you know he deals a lot in you know scientific stuff or you know stuff that um
 		you don't know whether could it could happen or not you know it's just um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know but i mean most of it is good i uh haven't uh i haven't read anything by him in a long time
 	
 	
 		well i noticed he had a couple i don't know how recent they are but i think <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sphere</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> and something else uh another one word title and i thought i might pick up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of those books because
 	
 	
 		Fear is that what you said Fear
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sphere S P H E R E</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh oh no i don't know i'm not familiar with that no
 	
 	
 		well how about did you read <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Silence</ENAMEX> of the Lambs
 	
 	
 		oh oh yes  oh yes you did you read his other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Red Dragon</ENAMEX> yes now uh both of them were terrific
 	
 	
 		yes i did
 		they were uh Silence of the Lambs though was i i could not put the book down i
 	
 	
 		well see now i couldn't either now i uh a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> of mine started to read it because you know i told her it's terrific and everybody she'd spoke to said it was terrific she couldn't get into it
 	
 	
 		you're kidding
 	
 	
 		well she's sort of a lightweight anyway you know her her uh her reading consists of uh have you ever heard of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V C Andrews</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh yes
 	
 	
 		yeah  you know stuff like that you know <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Danielle Steele</ENAMEX> you know you know stuff like that so she really she couldn't get into this but she i think she said she saw the movie she liked the movie i don't you know
 	
 	
 		i see
 		the movie was wonderful you didn't see it
 	
 	
 		yeah the movie was good but i well you know compared to the book right no
 	
 	
 		well true it didn't have the impact but i thought that they stayed uh they stayed very faithful to the book
 	
 	
 		well they did but um i don't think it was as scary as i expected it to be i i really you know
 		i i don't know i just didn't think it was as suspenseful as as
 		i expected it to be i don't know but it was a good it was a good movie
 	
 	
 		well
 		it's hard to top that book
 	
 	
 		yeah well that's true and i'm waiting his new one comes out sometime in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the spring</TIMEX> i think
 	
 	
 		oh really what's it about have you another serial killer
 	
 	
 		yes
 		uh probably another murder thing you know that's usually what he you know well this this'll be i think his <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX> book
 		and the other the previous ones were murder um the he wrote also Black <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> which was a about the uh bombing in the in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Superdome</ENAMEX> oh it was oh and they made a movie out of that
 	
 	
 		oh
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Minute Warning</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um gee i don't know i think it was called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Black</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> it was about fifteen well no about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten years ago</TIMEX> i guess it uh you know
 	
 	
 		you know i think you're right i think i
 	
 	
 		but um
 	
 	
 		i'll have to look back and see what else he's written because he
 	
 	
 		that's all he's written <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Red Dragon</ENAMEX>  that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> and uh Silence of the
 	
 	
 		really
