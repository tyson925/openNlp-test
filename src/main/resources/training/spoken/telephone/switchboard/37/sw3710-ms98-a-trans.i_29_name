 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh okay uh do you live in a a single family <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dwelling</ENAMEX> as they call it
 	
 	
 		yeah  i uh i'm buying my own home
 	
 	
 		okay what sort of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> is it
 	
 	
 		um well it's a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> story three <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedroom</ENAMEX> two bath <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> car <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garage</ENAMEX>
 		with a single living area a large single living area
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">garage</ENAMEX> is that an actual closed in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garage</ENAMEX> or is that carport type of thing
 	
 	
 		no it's a a closed in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garage</ENAMEX> to attached to the house
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		so that i can uh i can leave my home go into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">garage</ENAMEX> get in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> and not get into any weather at all
 	
 	
 		never actually be out of the house
 		yeah around here they tell you if it if the advertisement for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> for sale says garage
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it it it could mean anything from a uh part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all</TIMEX> closed in to a uh uh nice corrugated fiberglass roof kind of hanging in the middle of the yard somewhere
 	
 	
 		oh you're kidding that's crazy
 	
 	
 		yeah most of them are carports you know they'll be attached to the to the to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> but it'll just be a an extension of roof to over you know one or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> parking spaces where
 	
 	
 		to the home uh-huh
 		wow
 		uh-huh most of the time when i had when i was looking for a house matter of fact the
 		they would tell you if it were a carport or if it were um
 		if it were a detached garage
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		now y'all aren't quite getting all that flooding that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> has been getting have you
 	
 	
 		ah yeah  we're getting part of it uh-huh it's um
 	
 	
 		you're getting part of that uh uh
 		okay
 	
 	
 		it's really kind of odd we ah we had hoped not to be in too much of it and matter of fight matter of fact in in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>
 		they have flood plain areas where it's every about every <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">hundred years</TIMEX> the area floods where the insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> won't insure you for it
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah
 		what
 	
 	
 		like uh
 		like what is i'm trying to think of the name of that park
 	
 	
 		there's areas that are so bad about flooding that they just don't cover them
 	
 	
 		they yeah they wouldn't cut they will not issue flood insurance
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		and i can i can see where there's some areas in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> that are definitely like that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh
 	
 	
 		you know come to think of it it's that way around here too i mean you know there there's nothing even vaguely resembling hills around here
 	
 	
 		oh no huh we have
 	
 	
 		which was real confusing when i <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> moved into this area because it
 	
 	
 		was it what kind of uh <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> are you in
 	
 	
 		well actually right now my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> and i are living uh campus housing
 	
 	
 		oh okay is it uh apartment style or uh-huh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		they're apartment <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one and two</NUMEX> and three <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedroom</ENAMEX> places uh be like you know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		excuse me
 		like uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty five or thirty</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">units</ENAMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> and then something like uh
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty five thirty</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>
 	

 	
 		gosh
 	
 	
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about half</NUMEX> of them are
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedroom</ENAMEX> places
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		there's a pretty good number of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedroom places</ENAMEX> and then there's like uh fifteen or <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty three</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedroom</ENAMEX> places
 	
 	
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedroom</ENAMEX> uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but uh oh they're not really too bad they're they're basically cinder block places
 	
 	
 		well i was that's kind of what i had envisioned from uh visiting the ones in at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North Texas University</ENAMEX> where my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> just graduated
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		yeah graduated in in what
 	
 	
 		uh physics
 	
 	
 		physics
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PhD</ENAMEX> in physics
 	
 	
 		wow sounds like fun
 	
 	
 		oh yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		i i've got a physics <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> of physics <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX> facing me <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this summer this summer</TIMEX> so
 	
 	
 		uh actually they're they're very enlightening and they're a lot of fun
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah uh from what i've seen of it i mean you know there's a lot of things that kind of dabble in the edges of physics before you actually get into the class
 	
 	
 		they are
 		yeah well most everything touches physics one way or another no matter what you do even if nobody tells you that's what it is it's it's physics
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		yeah i remember a a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX> in high school saying that uh he enjoyed physics because it it improved his uh his uh <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">pool</ENAMEX> game
 	
 	
 		uh-huh oh yeah mathematics too but
 	
 	
 		uh anyway
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh back to housing what kind of a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> would you and your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> look for
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		once uh once you finish schooling
 	
 	
 		um well
 		once we get out of school we're hoping to get into the mountains somewhere
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		probably out west um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oregon Oregon</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah more than likely uh the rainy side of the mountains somewhere
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh that's a beautiful area
 	
 	
 		but uh um originally i'm from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Virginia</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appalachian Mountains</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so uh uh long since fell in love with living in the mountains but it'd probably be like a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> story possibly even a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> story if we build our own we might even get a little crazy and you know build into the side of a hill
 	
 	
 		oh i see
 	
 	
 		and do it the
 	
 	
 		that would probably
