 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay um what kind of hobbies do you have Lori
 	
 	
 		um i guess uh i like to play golf
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and um  i also like to plant <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> and do do some gardening and do arts and crafts
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh where do you play <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">golf</ENAMEX> or in this area
 	
 	
 		well we live uh pretty close to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Mesquite Golf Course</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so we'll play either out there or at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Firewheel</ENAMEX> that's usually where we play but i've played you know different courses in in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> area
 	
 	
 		do you uh do you ride or do you pull a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cart</ENAMEX> when you play golf
 	
 	
 		uh both  not at the same time
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i was gonna say that could be difficult
 	
 	
 		now sometimes we ride and sometimes um we pull we like to to a lot of times just walk for the exercise
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but i find that when i ride in a cart i play better and i think it's because i don't get as tired
 	
 	
 		i think that might be true
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i don't like pulling a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cart</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Firewheel</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">golf course</ENAMEX> because they want you to pull the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cart</ENAMEX> on the path
 	
 	
 		i know and that makes me so mad i you know it's like it's not gonna do that much damage to the course but apparently they think differently
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that's the reason i don't play over there
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i like the course but i don't play over there because
 		you they don't uh you know don't allow you to pull a cart
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and i don't think a cart damages the turf
 	
 	
 		right well the reason why we play over there is because since we're a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Garland</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">resident</ENAMEX> they give us a special deal where you can get um <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> rounds of <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">golf</ENAMEX> for
 		a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">hundred dollar</NUMEX> yeah a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">hundred dollars</NUMEX> because it's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> price what the normal green fees are
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so that's why we you know play over there because we've got our card
 	
 	
 		well i guess i could use a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> too i live uh very near very close to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Firewheel Golf Course</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh do you so you live in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Garland</ENAMEX> then
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yes i live in northwest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Garland</ENAMEX> right up there near the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">golf course</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		okay well we're in south <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Garland</ENAMEX> but yeah next time you go um
 		you know check into it they've uh it's just like uh a bus card and they just punch it you know it's got
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> through <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> on it and every time you go they just punch it for you
 	
 	
 		well in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last two years</TIMEX> i haven't played very much golf because i'm involved in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boy Scouts</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		so i have uh i have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> i have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children Boy Scout</ENAMEX> age i have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> that are <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Boy Scout</ENAMEX> age and so
 	
 	
 		you must have a a son
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		i'm very active in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boy Scouts</ENAMEX> so i'd have to say that camping and hiking and canoeing and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boy Scouts</ENAMEX> is my hobby
 	
 	
 		yeah oh well that sounds like fun too
 	
 	
 		but i like
 		but my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">golf clubs</ENAMEX> will probably rust before i get to use them again because my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> are still right at the beginning age and it's gonna probably be <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six to eight years</TIMEX> before they go to college
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well you need to teach them how to play take them out on the course with you
 	
 	
 		so
 		that's right lessons are expensive though
 	
 	
 		oh yeah well you can teach them
 	
 	
 		well they probably would never make it then because i don't think i only took lessons for <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">golf</ENAMEX> when i was in college
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		ah as a course for P E you know  so i could graduate
 	
 	
 		right right
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but uh that's the only time i think i've ever really taken golf lessons and that was kind of a group scenario and not individual
 	
 	
 		uh-huh right
 		right
 	
 	
 		i took <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> lesson <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> other time besides that um i just uh try to make the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">club</ENAMEX> hit the ball
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah i know what you mean
 	
 	
 		i don't wanna play strike out you know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but i have fun doing it some you know have some good shots and some bad shots
 	
 	
 		oh yeah it's it's just nice to get outdoors and do something
 	
 	
 		so you said you work uh in the gardens too do you have ah special flowers
 	
 	
 		well flower gardens i like to have matter fact <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this past weekend</TIMEX> i i just got finished planting a bunch of tulips and daffodil bulbs
 		so those ought to be coming up around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">spring</TIMEX> time
 	
 	
 		my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> had uh
 		just put in a bunch of i wanna say they're pansies
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		she put them in like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two months ago</TIMEX> because they're winter plants
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and they just bloom with all even with all the cold weather weather we've had they've been blooming just fine
 	
 	
 		oh they do great i put <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mine</ENAMEX> in probably in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		that's when she did i think
 	
 	
 		yeah i think was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November</TIMEX> and i don't do anything to mine i don't water <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mine</ENAMEX> or anything and they just they do really good and i even had i guess it was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year the year</TIMEX> before i had some out
 		and it froze and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pansies</ENAMEX> looked terrible but they came back later i didn't do anything to them so they're um
 		they're they're good to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> in the winter time
 		because they last for a long time then
 		so if you start putting them you know you can put them out in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the spring</TIMEX> too but once it starts getting real hot then it just kills them because they can't stand the hot weather
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		do they survive longer if you put them in the winter time will they make it through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX> some
 	
 	
 		no they won't make it through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX> because it gets too hot
 		but they'd make it through probably <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> and spring
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so
 		yeah i've got some of those too i love flowers
 	
 	
 		well
 		oh that's good
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and i do some i try to do some arts and crafts and i love to go <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">the to</NUMEX>
