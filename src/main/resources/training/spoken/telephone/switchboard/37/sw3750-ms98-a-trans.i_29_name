 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		okay so you enjoy camping
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i uh like like you i haven't done it in quite some time
 	
 	
 		yeah uh-huh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		except for what i call living now  which is which is very close to camping  yeah you know i i camped in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boy Scouts</ENAMEX> and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		is it uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> and i went out sometimes but uh even my first uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eight or nine years</TIMEX> of working i camped almost all the time because i was in construction
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and it's cheaper to pitch a tent and cook your meals out by the fire than it is to rent an <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> add to stress i mean you when you have to have it you got to have it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and you know in uh in those those kinds of situations uh you know room rent was just outrageous
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buddy</ENAMEX> and i we just camped  and we figured what the hell we did it when we were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> and we loved it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		course we didn't really rough it that much when when i was in in high school uh he's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of years</TIMEX> older than me and uh
 		he graduated and went off to college and and during during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> we'd camp out at the lake
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but it was wasn't very much like camping because we had a refrigerator and a stove and you know i had a little uh boat <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and floated it out on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lake Grapevine</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh well yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh well it was fantastic we'd get up in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX> go skiing
 		at that substituted for a shower you know and then we'd go to work and uh come back to the you know to the boat <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">in the afternoon</TIMEX> you know it's <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">still four o'clock</TIMEX> you got <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">four hours</TIMEX> of day light good skiing left
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh it was great
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh you know now my life is more like camping than not camping really
 	
 	
 		um-hum do you have electricity out there yeah you've got a phone obviously
 	
 	
 		oh yeah  well actually as a matter of fact they just ran the phone <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three years ago</TIMEX> we didn't have a phone
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>

 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so uh and we're at the end of the mail route  like i said we are probably as far as you can get from a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seven Eleven</ENAMEX> and still be in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i guess so huh

 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um so my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> loved fishing and camping so we'd go up first we went up just uh with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toyota</ENAMEX> pick up truck and laid out our sleeping bags under the stars and you know cooked our um hot <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> by the fire or whatever
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		but then later my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mom</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> got a camper so uh we've kind of moved up yeah a little bit in the world
 	
 	
 		became civilized
