 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but uh i do a i do a combination of uh uh running and weight training
 	
 	
 		they set that up for you
 	
 	
 		no i i actually i just you know joined on my own and i've been thinking about getting with a uh one of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counselors</ENAMEX> just so see what uh what they might have to offer as far as you know alternatives
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but i pretty much uh  worked on my own routine
 	
 	
 		and uh what kind of running do you do
 	
 	
 		they've got the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">track</ENAMEX> on the inside and uh i run one mile on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday Wednesdays</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Fridays</TIMEX> and then on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesdays</TIMEX> and Thursdays i run <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> miles
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and then after that i work out with weights
 	
 	
 		is it just aerobic or
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> and i work out with free weights
 	
 	
 		no i mean the running
 	
 	
 		oh uh yeah it's really uh aerobic work out part
 	
 	
 		you do it you do a mile in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about eight minutes</TIMEX> or less
 	
 	
 		uh <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about seven minutes</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh</ENAMEX> and then you wouldn't then you don't get um out of breath
 	
 	
 		uh no i do  yeah that's that's a pretty good pretty good clip and i'll be i'm pretty winded by the time i get done
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		but i mean he's just not pushing it real hard like you know if you tried to make <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> or something like that
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i i could i could probably go faster but then i'd wear myself out  and i wouldn't be able to work out anything else
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah how about you
 	
 	
 		yeah i i don't run much any more i did when i was in school i right now i just lift um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		weights and and do push ups and sit ups and and i jump rope a little bit and that's about it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i don't i don't lift any heavy weights uh they're <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about a third</NUMEX> of my body weight
 	
 	
 		oh i see
 		so just uh just try and keep them uh i guess uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		yeah and um um i play the trumpet and uh the more
 		upper body strength the easier it is to play you you have to do a you have to do a whole lot of sit ups and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah that's true
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and then i i hurt my neck uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about three years ago</TIMEX> so you really have to build up around your neck and your shoulders to keep from
 	
 	
 		hm
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um hurting yourself when you play high
 	
 	
 		oh i see
 		i see
 	
 	
 		you have to you have to do it correctly it's you know it's like an exercise in itself but a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> uh strain themselves doing it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		oh i see uh so you're in uh in part of a band
 	
 	
 		um i play at church
 	
 	
 		oh i see i see i used to play an instrument when i was in in high school but it wasn't the trumpet  so i was just wondering if that's what it was or something
 	
 	
 		and
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i see
 	
 	
 		well yeah
 	
 	
 		so you you have any plans of maybe running running more when the weather gets nicer
 	
 	
 		well yeah well the weather's nice except for when it rains you know i mean in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> yeah i keep thinking about it but that doesn't that doesn't get it done i i i mostly jump rope more you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		um-hum yeah i used to do a little bit of jumping rope and uh when i was uh a while back i was more into <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">basketball</ENAMEX> and uh i used to do a lot of jump rope and other jumping exercises to try to build my <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">calves</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh but it's been a while since i've done that
 	
 	
 		yeah i i do a toe lift and squats for that but you know i it it doesn't um
 	
 	
 		i see
 	
 	
 		it doesn't um
 		accustom your your legs to the kind of strength that you have like when you're running for a long time they they tend to tighten up whenever you whenever you have to do something at a at a great length of time
 	
 	
 		right right
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah i i that's true i've noticed that uh
 	
 	
 		and it also builds too much mass if you just you know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so and it's like i i lift weights with about the the same curl weight as i do the squats with
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and um then it doesn't bother me very much
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah huh that's that's interesting though i you know i've been thinking of changing i've done the same routine for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">almost two years</TIMEX> now and i'm thinking it of changing it up
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh that's why well you know i was thinking to talking to one of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counselors</ENAMEX> and see what different exercises they could get me on to get out of the routine
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		because i've heard that you know you get locked into routines and you're gonna hit this up point where you just stop developing
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so i'm looking at changing things a little bit
 	
 	
 		yeah that's i i started doing more push ups and it it's helped a lot and then i add sets to it so that i don't like you said wear it out i don't try to push it to the end in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> set
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
