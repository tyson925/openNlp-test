 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so what do you think about the uh income taxes
 	
 	
 		well i could do with a lot less than that
 	
 	
 		where do you live
 	
 	
 		i live in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		okay i live in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> too
 	
 	
 		oh good well i live in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Plano</ENAMEX> in that case
 	
 	
 		okay i live in uh in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Village</ENAMEX> do you know where that is i
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i do yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah well one thing i can tell you i hate about the taxes in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> is the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight and a quarter</NUMEX> percent sales tax
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		it i think it's like the highest in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> because my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> lived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> and it was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only seven</NUMEX> percent there
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DC</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only six</NUMEX> percent
 		and where i moved from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only four and a half</NUMEX> percent and i can tell you we were upset when it went to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four and a half</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		i know
 	
 	
 		it was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only four</NUMEX> percent
 	
 	
 		and you know we had no sales tax here about oh i don't know maybe <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten years ago</TIMEX> we had none at all and that's how it started with uh <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">four percent</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five</TIMEX> percent
 	
 	
 		really
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and all of a sudden here we are now
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and it's horrible
 	
 	
 		what
 		since there's no uh state tax i assume that that's why it went up fast because <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX> does have a state tax
 	
 	
 		well
 		it's true but they did without it all those years
 	
 	
 		um-hum hm
 	
 	
 		and they keep talking about the state tax and they'll probably put <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> in and they'll have this too so
 	
 	
 		yeah it
 		if they put state tax in i mean i'll be pretty upset
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		because i mean part of the reason part of the incentives of moving to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX> was the fact that you have no state tax and basically it adds about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixty</TIMEX> dollars to your paycheck
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh every <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks</TIMEX> and uh  if that comes back in
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i'll be pretty mad because <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixty</TIMEX> dollars a paycheck is a lot of money actually you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so uh i don't know i'm not very much for a for state tax
 	
 	
 		well i hope it doesn't but you know how it goes so
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah they keep talking about uh you know the light rail system adding taxes
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and then uh there was another issue that came up i forget uh the horse racing
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		they're putting up the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the</ENAMEX> racing fees they said they may raise taxes because of that yeah they said uh to build okay
 	
 	
 		raise them
 	
 	
 		apparently they said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">builders</ENAMEX> would provide <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">thirty million dollars</NUMEX> in funds
 		and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> would need to provide sixty <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">five million dollars</NUMEX> in funds
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		well in order to get the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">sixty five million</NUMEX> dollars it would cause an increase in taxes
 		but it seems like it would pay itself off
 	
 	
 		oh well it will
 	
 	
 		so you know  what's the purpose of the increasing the sales tax you know
 	
 	
 		probably the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah so you know
 	
 	
 		but they're funny about things like that here
 	
 	
 		yeah things like that you know
 	
 	
 		they really are when i came here you couldn't buy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beer</ENAMEX> couldn't buy a drink  nothing was open on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> not even a grocery <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX> i mean nothing nothing you know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 		no huh
 	
 	
 		so it was a lot worse and as more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> come in it does get better but they still have some real funny laws
 	
 	
 		um-hum i mean you know federal tax i mean everybody has to pay standard around the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> and that doesn't bother me that much you know the you buy a house you cut your taxes a little bit the rest of it you pay what you owe
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh  like sales tax and i where i lived in uh in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX> they had personal property tax in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">counties</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and that was a lot my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> paid <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">almost four thousand dollars</NUMEX> a year in personal property tax on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> they paid <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">almost a thousand dollars</NUMEX> on uh
 	
 	
 		oh that is
 	
 	
 		on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of our <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> and they paid like <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a couple hundred</NUMEX> dollars on the other <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> but the personal property tax itself used to add up
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		you know just i mean itself would probably add up to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">eight thousand dollars</NUMEX> a year
 	
 	
 		hm
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and that's a lot of money you know most places go ahead and just you know put it into your mortgage payment so you don't forget about it at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the last minute</TIMEX> you know and have to come up with the funds at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the year</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		that is
 		yeah
 		hm
 	
 	
 		but that gets real expensive
 	
 	
 		oh yeah that is
 	
 	
 		do they have that kind of tax down here on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> at all do you know
 	
 	
 		uh uh they well they do a little bit but um
 		it's it's like next to nothing i've seen it it's on my when you pay your registration and stuff like that there is a little place
 	
 	
 		um
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		well you know like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every year</TIMEX> they renew the registration here kind of like fifty or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixty</TIMEX> bucks
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		it costs what
 	
 	
 		so it's only like fifty or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixty</TIMEX> bucks to renew your registration here but in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX> they won't renew your registration till you pay your property personal property tax
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i had a i  i paid you know twelve <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">hundred dollars</NUMEX> a year for my last car
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		for personal property tax alone so that was kind of a relief i guess
 	
 	
 		God
 	
 	
 		that's not too bad but other than that everything worked out
 	
 	
 		yeah so you haven't been here very long
 	
 	
 		what's that
 	
 	
 		you haven't been here very long
 	
 	
 		i've been here <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about two years</TIMEX> now
 	
 	
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		but uh in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the two years</TIMEX> i've i've been here i've been through i've had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so i've never really like you know
 		i don't know if they if they ever will assess a personal uh any kind of tax
 	
 	
 		uh yeah
 	
 	
 		on the car other than what i paid when i registered uh registered the car
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so that's the only thing i can really think of
 		so so do you work for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> or you just doing this
 	
 	
 		no i don't i'm a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurse</ENAMEX> i work down at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Presbyterian</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		okay yeah someone just mentioned this program to me so i thought it'd be kind of cool
 	
 	
 		yeah oh it is you know they're supposed to cut you off at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> calls at least that's what i heard that you could could get to do <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> calls
 	
 	
 		oh do they really
 		yeah i i don't know how the thing works uh
 	
 	
 		and this is like the seventeenth
 	
 	
 		oh really  all right you
 	
 	
 		yeah so it's great
