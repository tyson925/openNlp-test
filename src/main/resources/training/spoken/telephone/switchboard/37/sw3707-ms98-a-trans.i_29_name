 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh we have a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sheltie Collie</ENAMEX> a miniature Sheltie
 	
 	
 		do you
 	
 	
 		yeah it's about oh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about six months</TIMEX> old
 		and we're trying we're we we live in an <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> so we don't have a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">yard</ENAMEX> so it has to stay stay stay inside and we're having a difficult time trying to train it
 	
 	
 		how old is it
 	
 	
 		it's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about six months</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh you you're you're in the roughest stages of pet ownership i think
 	
 	
 		really
 		but they're supposed to be real <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">intelligent dogs</ENAMEX> but i guess every one one  every one one of them or or every once in a while you get one that's not so intelligent because this one isn't
 	
 	
 		well
 		i don't i don't know if that has anything to do with the intelligence really the the the training bit uh i've had dogs through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</TIMEX> right now i've got <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
 		and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> but
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> and uh my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> and daughter-in-law have kind of a Sheltie <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mix</ENAMEX> and we watched it <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this summer</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two to three months</TIMEX> and it wasn't trained quite fully either
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh but it was a sweet and an intelligent dog
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		so how'd y'all how do you what's the best method
 	
 	
 		i don't know i i'm old fashioned and when i got my my <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> when they when they did something i hollered at them and threw them outside they say that's not the way to do it now but you're just supposed to
 	
 	
 		right
 		stand outside with them until they
 	
 	
 		no just just you put them outside i guess unless you catch catch them in the act
 	
 	
 		well we're hardly ever at home so it's kind of difficult and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know you don't wanna you don't wanna spank it or scare it or anything like that so
 	
 	
 		no you no you don't wanna do that but uh
 	
 	
 		yeah we we try to take it
 		you know it gets  it gets frustrating when you take it outside and you know and then it runs right inside and it does it huh
 	
 	
 		does does does it just wanna sniff around and
 		does it just wanna sniff around and play when it's outside
 	
 	
 		yeah a lot of times and you know it it won't it's whole job outside and it comes inside
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		have have you praised it and given it a treat maybe when it does something outside
 	
 	
 		uh yeah we've tried that and uh
 		you know there's certain spots in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> where he likes to go so and he chews on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> and all that but you know that's natural for a little <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">puppy huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that's nothing huh
 		well it it it'll it'll catch on pretty soon i'll i'll i'll betcha i i have a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixteen year old almost sixteen year</TIMEX> old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golden Retriever</ENAMEX> and she's gone the other way because she's so old she doesn't have much control
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		so we're battling with that problem and she still feels good uh she can't hear worth a darn or see very well but she's got a great appetite and she knows we're there by smell
 	
 	
 		oh that's sad
 		huh
 		how old is it
 	
 	
 		she'll be <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixteen</TIMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> that's sad
 	
 	
 		and yeah but we can't bear to do anything because she's been our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> for all these <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> so we're putting up with all her accidents
 	
 	
 		oh of course not
 		i couldn't
 	
 	
 		and the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last two nights ago</TIMEX> she had diarrhea and so that was a bad one but uh i think we're buying a carpet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">shampooer</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this weekend</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		that is really sad what what's the deal we we try to we're trying to take it on walks now you know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and we can't because it's not accustomed to being on a leash
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and so it i mean this <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> really feels like it's being killed or something when you try to you know tug on it to walk it i mean it just goes like a mad dog i mean it just jumps up and down and starts yapping and
 	
 	
 		does it oh
 	
 	
 		it's you know  i mean it's not even close to even being trained on a leash
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		uh you know maybe you need you can get it signed up <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this spring</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> for some of the dog obedience classes
 	
 	
 		um-hum well we've heard bad we've heard some bad things about some of those you know they
 		sometimes misuse misuse their
 		license or whatever you know and they treat them bad
 	
 	
 		oh
 		well you know where we went we went to the junior college <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Richland</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		and we took my my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> was living at home then and she took our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golden Retriever</ENAMEX> or not the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Golden Retriever the Norwegian Elk Hound</ENAMEX> over there and
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		it it it's a pretty good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> and they did pretty good except this <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> is she's just pretty she's not smart  so she didn't learn a lot but it i think it calmed her down a little bit and she's used to being around other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> now
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		how long did it take
 	
 	
 		i think it was like a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six week</TIMEX> program
 	
 	
 		every what
 	
 	
 		uh i think it was <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one night</TIMEX> a week for like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six weeks</TIMEX> and uh you know it was a group <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> outside
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		it was fairly reasonable too
 	
 	
 		well <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sheltie Collies</ENAMEX> are you know timid and they don't really unless they get used to something they're really nervous and
 	
 	
 		yeah they're pretty they're usually a high strung <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> aren't they
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah and uh if they're not accustomed to something they they're really scared so
 	
 	
 		um our our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> has a
