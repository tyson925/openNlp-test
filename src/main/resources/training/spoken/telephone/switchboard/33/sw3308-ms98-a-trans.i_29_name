 
     		
 	
 		there okay i hope we've done it right uh we're supposed to talk about music
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yes
 		okay
 		oh well that's good because i'm a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">singer</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		well good what kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">singer</ENAMEX> are you
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um in high school and college it was classical lately it's been more contemporary country
 	
 	
 		oh really do you do you sing in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> or
 	
 	
 		well
 		no actually i do what's called karaoke um the
 	
 	
 		oh tell me what that is
 	
 	
 		it's a a thing where you've got a background video that just has the background music the instrumentals and there the video has the words to the songs on it and you can sing along with the with the tape
 		it's pretty neat they do it at a lot of different clubs
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		um like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dave</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buster</ENAMEX>'s and
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		oh little country bars and stuff
 	
 	
 		and and so you stand up in front of the
 	
 	
 		you get up in a front of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audience</ENAMEX> and a microphone
 	
 	
 		and and where and uh are you looking at the words
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah they've got a little TV <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">monitor</ENAMEX> on the stage most most places do
 	
 	
 		so so who sees it do you just see it
 	
 	
 		um the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> singing sees the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">monitor</ENAMEX> and most places have a big screen behind you so that everybody can see the words yeah
 	
 	
 		so that everybody sees it
 		do they sing along
 	
 	
 		uh not usually unless it's a real ratty song  it's it's fun
 	
 	
 		well how cute so that way that keeps them from being able to have other uh have or other musicians
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		uh-huh yeah it's you some of the places do karaoke like once or twice <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a week</TIMEX> and then they have like there's a a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> bar or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> saloon i used to go to that they have uh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> bands most of the rest of the week
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it's it's pretty neat i like it
 	
 	
 		well that and and you and so you get up and sing it yourself
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		well great
 	
 	
 		i i i had a a music scholarship to college but i didn't use it  so what do you do
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		well i am a music <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teacher</ENAMEX>  i teach uh elementary music in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Plano</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		oh how neat
 		oh i don't know about elementary  i don't know i think elementary would be good  that would be interesting with the little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		huh
 		well
 		it it it it has a lot of uh very  um  rewarding parts and then the there are lots of it that you know you feel like you're just a bouncer
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 		uh-huh yeah i i i can remember music back then
 	
 	
 		and then the paperwork and all of that but generally where i am i
 		um i uh this has been the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the best</TIMEX> situation in terms of not having a lots of discipline problems and and having <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> that really are pretty interested in in music in general
 	
 	
 		oh good
 		hm
 	
 	
 		so it's really been nice but
 	
 	
 		i think that's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> reason i got out of music because i didn't think i wanted to go into teaching and at at that point it was either performing or teaching it was like oh well
 	
 	
 		well it and
 		yeah it it's and i think that's a real valid reason for not majoring in it my boys
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		were good in it and  they didn't even even i mean that was the reason they they took a lot of it in college but they didn't go on with it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah well i after college i got out got married started working or started working got married and i didn't sing for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten years</TIMEX> and i just found karaoke <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last October</TIMEX> i guess
 		and i was just thrilled i loved it it's it's neat
 	
 	
 		now you didn't you didn't sing in uh uh  during those <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten years</TIMEX> you didn't sing at all
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um not really not in not in anything not in anything organized no
 	
 	
 		not even like in church <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">choir</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it periodically if we go to like
 		a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas Eve</TIMEX> services where they do the part of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Messiah</ENAMEX> or something like that but that was about it but back in high school i was more of a classical kind of stuff through <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wagner</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chopin and and Schubert</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum uh-huh</ENAMEX>

 		my goodness  i kind of wondered
 		i kind of wondered if your voice if you uh  might be you know old usually country <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">singers</ENAMEX> uh or folksingers have lower voices that
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>

 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh</ENAMEX> ooh
 		really
 	
 	
 		and her stuff i normally have to take up at least a step if not a step and a half
 	
 	
 		well is that a bad uh oh they're probably i wonder if that means they've cut us off
 	
 	
 		i don't know
