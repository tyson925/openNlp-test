 
     		
 	
 		now then what is your idea on what to serve for a dinner party
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um i don't know i i i personally don't throw a lot of dinner <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> per se um
 	
 	
 		well if you were just gonna have company what would
 	
 	
 		um generally if i'm gonna have company something fairly easy for me to fix you know nobody wants to go to too much work um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		probably say it
 		you know if it's more than say <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four or five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> probably a like a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a</NUMEX> a fish <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dish</ENAMEX> or something or or a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">a</ENAMEX> pasta
 		pasta dish
 	
 	
 		well what kind of pasta what pasta dishes  what is your specialty in pasta
 	
 	
 		um
 		generally uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">homemade</ENAMEX> pasta the wide whatever they call that stuff the wider homemade pastas
 	
 	
 		do you yeah do you make your own
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		ooh that must be interesting
 	
 	
 		yeah it uh it's fairly easy you just make the dough in the old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cuisinart</ENAMEX> and
 		roll it out and there's there's a we've got a special machine that you you roll it out and then it cuts it also and hang it over the drying rack
 	
 	
 		okay do you ever um since we're coming into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the holiday season</TIMEX> do you ever do desserts
 	
 	
 		um
 		actually about the only dessert i i generally fix is some form of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pie</ENAMEX> or a buttermilk pound cake i  those the only kind of desserts i really like messing with anything anything more difficult than that is is
 		generally a pain to me i i just don't like to take that much time and stand around and do it
 	
 	
 		do you um do you care for the fruitcake
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		not at all
 	
 	
 		i i i can i i can stand about a piece a year <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> piece of it <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> but i i don't like to just eat it it's
 	
 	
 		okay i have come upon a recipe <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several years ago</TIMEX> that is the now i don't care for fruitcake period
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah
 	
 	
 		and this one is absolutely it's so easy and it is so wonderful everyone i serve it to that does not even care for fruitcake wants the recipe
 	
 	
 		uh  it's it's it's kind of funny i i don't think i've ever met anybody that actually likes fruitcake
 	
 	
 		oh my older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> does oh she just thinks it's wonderful and we always provided her with with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> but this is one can of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eagle Brand</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		a pound of nuts a pound of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cherries uh candied cherries</ENAMEX> and a pound of something else in the candied fruits
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		mix that up put it in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spray</ENAMEX> a pan loaf pan
 		pour it into the pan and cook it at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two hundred and twenty five</NUMEX> degrees
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about about an hour</TIMEX> and it's it is wonderful
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		that doesn't have all that citrine in it and i think that is what the uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are so opposed to with with the fruitcake
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but maybe <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sometime</TIMEX> when you have nothing better to do you would like to try that one
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		so
