 		well did you understand what this was for you know what it was for what we
 	
 	
 		um television shows sure that sounds good
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		okay  i i don't watch too many but we can try it are you ready to start okay just a minute

 		okay i guess we're recording now
 	
 	
 		yeah okay
 	
 	
 		what are your favorite television shows
 	
 	
 		well i don't really watch too many TV shows other than uh occasionally i'll i'll turn on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donahue</ENAMEX> because it comes on <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">in the morning</TIMEX> when i seem to be getting ready around here
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		and uh so if if there's no one else around you know it's just me and i have a chance to listen to something i'll turn that on but uh just for the  for the conversation factor i think
 		but and then i think i enjoy when i catch it i don't even know what night it's on but <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Designing Women</ENAMEX> sometimes
 	
 	
 		oh i love that show yes that is great
 	
 	
 		yeah do you
 		yeah it's fun and then there's a new one that started out that i've caught occasionally a couple of times called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Good</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Evil</ENAMEX> i think
 	
 	
 		oh i heard they just canceled that i read in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s paper they just canceled that show
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		it is a real different one it's um it's it's different i guess i watch it more out of the uniqueness of it and the time that it comes on more than the fact that i have to see it but
 	
 	
 		
  
 		have you seen the show it's it's new <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Home Front</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		no i haven't watched that
 	
 	
 		oh it's it's really good it's um
 		i think it's on like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">nights</TIMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eleven</NUMEX> and it's set in post <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> times
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and it's about how the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">servicemen</ENAMEX> come home and readjust to civilian life here and the changes everyone's going through it's really interesting
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		it's kind of like a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">soap</ENAMEX> a nighttime soap opera type thing
 	
 	
 		sounds neat
 	
 	
 		it is it's a good it's really well written
 	
 	
 		is that on what channel what station
 	
 	
 		um i don't even know to tell you the truth
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 		what other shows do you like
 	
 	
 		um i prefer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oprah Winfrey to Donahue</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		well she comes on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later</TIMEX> and i usually have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> around so i don't end end up watching that one is the only problem i have with it i guess
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh
 		i did watch soap operas but i work full-time now and can't catch those anymore
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		except when i'm home sick and now when i watch them i think why did i ever watch those
 	
 	
 		that's right yeah
 	
 	
 		they're stupid
 		so when i did watch them i was addicted to them <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but not anymore

 		yeah
 		well i think
 		i also course like to catch the news during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the evening hours</TIMEX> but uh it's a little tough because that's when i'm usually making dinner and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> are wanting to talk all at the same time so usually i don't get a whole lot of news watching in
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 		yes we watch <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNN</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX> while we're getting ready
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> and eating breakfast
 		we'll catch our news that way
 		watch the weather channel so that we know what the weather's going to be like
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		so what have you seen interesting on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oprah Winfrey</ENAMEX> lately
 	
 	
 		lately i haven't been catching it because of my work schedule um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i can't remember the last time i saw it it's been a while
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well i don't know if we've talked <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">our full three minutes</TIMEX> or not
 	
 	
 		i don't know sometimes they come on and and say
 	
 	
 		oh that's right
 	
 	
 		well <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNN</ENAMEX> they were talking about
 		something like this about um
 		learning to recognize voices and words and stuff and the research that's going on which is kind of what we're doing helping them get a database for words
 	
 	
 		hm
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's really interesting
 	
 	
 		it is interesting
 	
 	
 		do you work for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texas Instruments</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so uh
 		no no just uh doing this as a fund-raiser for our church
 	
 	
 		oh that's nice
 	
 	
 		yeah so it kind of makes it easy you know to do a little something for it
 	
 	
 		sure because we uh we've talked to a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> it seems so we thought well maybe they work from for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX>
