 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and we uh took we subscribe to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNN</ENAMEX> and we took that and we started watching a lot of those especially during the war or during any kind of thing like the earthquake and i have gotten stuck on a lot of this the news shows and the stuff that comes on that
 		that it you know like the uh at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> the discussion talk shows and things and we really haven't gotten a lot into the sitcoms that are current
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh especially with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> here because we have to kind of filter it before they get here
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		we have little ones uh we do let them watch <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">911</NUMEX> and we think that's kind of informative to teach them how to handle things in situations
