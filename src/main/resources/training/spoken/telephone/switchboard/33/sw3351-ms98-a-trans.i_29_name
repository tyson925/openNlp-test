 		wow  the um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		do the skunk uh was that kind of like a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> to have around the house
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		yeah so it
 	
 	
 		it was litter trained and we had it perfumed and um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it was very aggressive but all the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> of them <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog cat</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">skunk</ENAMEX> used to chase each other all through the house
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and the only thing we have with the skunk he was very very protective of his territory
 	
 	
 		the skunk
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		being the sofa and the
 		blanket on the sofa nobody came near it when he was there
 	
 	
 		hm
 		oh
 		um
 		i had i had a dog <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time and uh he chased after a after a skunk and got sprayed so we had to uh we had to give him a tomato tomato juice bath
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and uh and get him cleaned up
 	
 	
 		yeah they um
 		ours would still back up to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> when he got mad
 		and try to perfume them but
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">glands</ENAMEX> had been removed so
 	
 	
 		right but i suppose it was still in the instinct of them to
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		to back off and
 		get ready
 		
  
 	
 	
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> other question we had is why do you have pets
 	
 	
 		yeah why i don't know i i think they're kind of nice to have they're kind of i don't know just relaxing to
 		i don't know to pet and to
 		i don't know when they like sit up on your lap and stuff like that
 		just kind of enjoyable to you know
 		have like i don't know something giving you some affection
 		as well what what do you think
 	
 	
 		yeah i always said if i died well i always said if i died i'd come back as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX>  that'd be the best way to be
 	
 	
 		oh yeah yeah
 		yeah
 		um do you like big <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> or or little dogs
 	
 	
 		well we had a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German Shepherd</ENAMEX> and he had dysplasia
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and he had it for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about three or four years</TIMEX> where we just about had to lift him and carry him every place he went
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		so when he died we got a little one
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but our <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shepherd</ENAMEX> was almost thirteen <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years old</TIMEX> and it just you know it was almost cruel
 	
 	
 		um-hum almost cruel for him to to walk
 	
 	
 		because yeah he just he couldn't get up he couldn't walk so he was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred and twenty</NUMEX> pounds so it was a chore
 	
 	
 		wow yeah
 	
 	
 		so we said the next time around we'd get something little that if something happened it would be easier to carry
 	
 	
 		sure
 		yeah it was something
 	
 	
 		and then we've had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> in our married life
