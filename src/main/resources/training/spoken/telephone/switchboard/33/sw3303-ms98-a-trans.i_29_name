 
     		
 	
 		okay you wanna go ahead and tell me your favorite <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> or who you think will be doing well this year
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh well where i'm from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">coast</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">conference</ENAMEX> is a very big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">conference</ENAMEX> and
 		course we have <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Duke University</ENAMEX> that was the national <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">champions</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> so i'm kind of hoping that they'll repeat again <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> they have a lot of the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX> back
 	
 	
 		now we talking about is this the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBA</ENAMEX> this is college college okay
 	
 	
 		no this is college basketball right we have like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Carolina</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Duke</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Georgia Tech</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NC State</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> that are normally ranked in the top <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so hopefully we'll have <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a good year</TIMEX> i don't really  follow the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBA</ENAMEX> very closely
 	
 	
 		and see that's probably all all i like saw while i we have moved in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last couple years</TIMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Utah</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> and there's so many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">colleges</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">universities</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> we haven't really
 		followed them too much and none of them are our our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">alma mater</ENAMEX>  so that seems to help
 	
 	
 		do you like professional <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">basketball</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh  i've uh follow it especially around the play-offs so course i was real familiar with the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Utah Jazz</ENAMEX> and
 		the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mailman</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karl Malone</ENAMEX> was you know pretty big thing and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lakers</ENAMEX> have always been amazing to watch
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		no i i did keep track a little bit of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mavericks</ENAMEX> they've
 		not had any good <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seasons</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a long time</TIMEX> and have a lot of problems with with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tarpley</ENAMEX> and maybe now that that's over they'll they'll come out of it but
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well that's an up and coming team though
 	
 	
 		yeah i hope they do something they need to or they're not going to have any esteem left at all
 	
 	
 		that's somebody you can get behind and be patient
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah kind of like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cowboys</ENAMEX> i guess
 	
 	
 		yeah they seem to be kind of not having a very good few seasons
 	
 	
 		yeah they coming out of it <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> we'll see if it holds on
 	
 	
 		but i think <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX> will probably win the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBA</ENAMEX> again
 	
 	
 		the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bulls</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah they'll probably be pretty good and course the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Celtics</ENAMEX> they're always really  really good too with their players
 	
 	
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		be interesting to see how the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the Olympics</ENAMEX> does this year with all the  the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX> playing on the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Olympic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		that's true it will be interesting and it'll certainly be different
 	
 	
 		so yeah i don't know how close i'll follow them and and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the season</TIMEX> hasn't started yet i'm usually more at the end of the season <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> and we need to talk about <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">baseball</ENAMEX>  and so
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		yeah oh my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atlanta Braves</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		well they did well
 	
 	
 		well i really do uh yeah the basketball season supposed to start in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next couple of weeks</TIMEX>  it's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a long season</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		it's yeah yeah
 		it is it is and that's why i've i guess my mind went blank it's like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last season</TIMEX> was so long ago and i haven't really even started thinking about <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">basketball</ENAMEX> yet so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but this wasn't a good subject but but we'll see how our predictions come true
 	
 	
 		it's a little early
 		we definitely will
 	
 	
 		okay well it's good talking to you
 	
 	
 		good to talk to you bye-bye
 	
 	
 		alrighty bye-bye
