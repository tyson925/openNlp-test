 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh i guess i've always kind of liked golf i i worked on a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">golf course</ENAMEX> at at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time and that's how i picked up golf
 		and uh
 		i don't know it's just a kind of a challenging game
 	
 	
 		it sure is i play <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least three</NUMEX> times a week
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i'm on it
 	
 	
 		i haven't gotten the chance lately though to play i'm trying to get back into it uh
 		so uh i got to start all over again it's not like riding a bicycle you do tend to forget
 	
 	
 		no
 		well i'm one of those rare left handed golfers
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and i do enjoy playing
 	
 	
 		
 
 		what's your handicap
 	
 	
 		right now it's three
 	
 	
 		okay
 		yeah i was down at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about four or five</NUMEX> quite awhile ago it's probably up there to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty now</TIMEX> if if i was ever to start again
 	
 	
 		well if you play with some consistency though you can get it right back down
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		i got to try and get out there i
 		i know with uh our long winters i i enjoy watching it i don't know if it's just because i like the game or i just like to to see the warm weather
 	
 	
 		uh well we can usually play here <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> round
 		sometimes in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January</TIMEX> it's not too comfortable to play
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but there's usually <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two or three days in the week</TIMEX> that you can get out there and play and i'm pretty much addicted to golf so
 		i get out there one way or the other
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah that's the problem out here with the long layovers with the winter you almost have to relearn every <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">spring</TIMEX> to
 		to get back out
 	
 	
 		it's a good game though it's very challenging and the reason i like it so much is because i'm
 		essentially playing against myself
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that's the way i look at it i i play in in lot a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> and but i don't
 		they keep score and
 		between themselves but i really don't care um i go out and each shot i say well this is what i'm gonna try to do and then i see how close i can come to that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		right
 		yeah you always work on trying to improve <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each day</TIMEX> and
 	
 	
 		yeah and inevitably inevitably <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> facet facet of my game isn't working at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time or another either i'm not driving very well or i'm not hitting long irons very well or i'm not putting well or
 		but sometimes it all comes together
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i i know what you mean i when i used to golf out there i'd putt well but i i wouldn't uh chip well one of the two uh
 		or something would go wrong but
 		i always managed to to get near par anyway
 	
 	
 		well we just had the tour championship here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pine Hurst</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and i went to that and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Craig Statler</ENAMEX> won in the play-offs
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but we uh this is a big golf area
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		we have a lot of uh
 		i'd say we probably have  within <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">fifteen miles</NUMEX> twenty golf <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> built around <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX> that are
 		pretty well designed and then of course <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pine Hurst</ENAMEX> and
 		we still have the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Greensboro Open</ENAMEX> here <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every year</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		do you have uh long waits uh to get on the course
 	
 	
 		yes we do as a matter of fact it it uh it's only been that way in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last five years</TIMEX> but now you uh most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX> have a uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two day</TIMEX> advance tee time you have to call
 	
 	
 		yeah okay yeah
 		i just moved into this small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> so i'm
 		gonna try and get in one of their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">golf courses</ENAMEX> here and
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i'm hoping it won't be quite i was from the uh
 		twin <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> area
 	
 	
 		that's some cold golf too isn't it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		are you sure you <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> aren't having the bad weather
 	
 	
 		we have cold
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		usually <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January and the first two weeks</TIMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February</TIMEX>
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well i wish that's all we had
 	
 	
 		but um <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX> we were in the seventies and
 		something's coming through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">now</TIMEX> so it's like in the low forties right now
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		but uh it's supposed to leave early in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the week</TIMEX> and then be back in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the sixties</TIMEX>
 		we have very windy winters
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		and very cold
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but we don't get any snow anymore i don't i don't know what changed that pattern we used to get
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">five inches</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> now we get nothing it's been probably <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five years</TIMEX> since we've had any measurable snowfall
 	
 	
 		oh i see well at least it that doesn't uh get in the way of golfing so
 	
 	
 		no but i have played golf in the snow before
 	
 	
 		that
 	
 	
 		yep get out my orange golf ball and go out and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		now that's what they do here sometimes you hear about it where they'll take the orange ball out there but
 		if you got
