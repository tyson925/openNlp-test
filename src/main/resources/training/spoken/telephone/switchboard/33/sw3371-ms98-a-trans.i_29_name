 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so what kind of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX> do you live in
 	
 	
 		uh i'm in a uh in a ranch a uh it was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about uh sixteen hundred square feet</NUMEX> when i bought it and uh it's <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about two thousand square feet</NUMEX> now but it's one of those typical
 		uh <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ranches</ENAMEX> that you find around here oh it's uh built in the
 		probably built in the late fifties so it's not um what you would find uh
 		uh where you live but uh
 		for the older <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">um ranch homes</ENAMEX> it's pretty typical i guess
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		well our <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">home</ENAMEX> is uh probably for our area it's probably one of the lower
 		income <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> out here  um
 		most of the the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> that they're building well i shouldn't say all of them but most of them
 		now are up in the
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of dollars oh oh yeah there's
 	
 	
 		really
 		how many <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">square feet</NUMEX> do you have
 	
 	
 		we have got about uh <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty</TIMEX>
 		i'd say about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty four hundred</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> bedrooms
 	
 	
 		um we've got <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedrooms</ENAMEX> because we built on to our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garage</ENAMEX> a a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedroom</ENAMEX> for my mother
 	
 	
 		<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five bedrooms</TIMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		i made a i made a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedroom</ENAMEX> out of uh i i made a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedroom</ENAMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of our out of our living room and then
 		added a uh what we call a sunroom to get the you know when we when we added <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">hundred square feet</NUMEX> to our house
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh that's great
 	
 	
 		so yeah
 	
 	
 		well this this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> is very comfortable we've got <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> living areas and that that's the thing i probably like the most about it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		how many stories just one
 	
 	
 		it's just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> story yeah it's a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fox</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jacobs</ENAMEX> home
 	
 	
 		how are they built
 	
 	
 		um we've been real happy with it
 	
 	
 		yeah i've heard the i've heard the construction's pretty good on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fox</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jacobs</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		course i'm not a carpenter or anything like that they could probably come in and say gee this is not straight and this is under something that
 	
 	
 		but i mean it doesn't give you trouble
 	
 	
 		no no we haven't had a lot of problems with it at all
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		no cracked slab or anything like that
 	
 	
 		no we've been real lucky
 	
 	
 		um
 		and is it um uh natural gas and
 	
 	
 		so
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh you know what i miss though basements
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		i sure i sure wish they could build <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">basements</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah i i've heard a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> say that that's for sure uh we have an <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">attic</ENAMEX> that we've just put you know plywood over over the beams and things up in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">attic</ENAMEX> and so that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		so you
 	
 	
 		has replaced it to some extent but certainly not
 	
 	
 		can you stand up in it
 	
 	
 		uh in parts i mean you couldn't you really couldn't use it for a room
 	
 	
 		so you have a probably a more pitched roof than is typical around here
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		it's ours is pitched so shallow that you uh don't get much <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">attic</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah we uh we've got you know i'll store all our <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> stuff and whatever else junk up there
 	
 	
 		so <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedrooms</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> living <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>  family things
 	
 	
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> living areas we have a living room and dining <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> at the front of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and then we have a the uh family <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room kitchen</ENAMEX> and play room
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		at the rear of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX> which has been really nice
 		in fact i really enjoy the playroom that you you would think that would not be a real
 		bonus you know to a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> but of all the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> i'd say that was
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		that was the one that's been really nice to have
 	
 	
 		isn't it funny how <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> end up living in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> most of the time
 	
 	
 		i think that's true yeah probably our family <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>'s the the biggest uh
 	
 	
 		you can
 		right some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> i mean <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> seem to migrate towards <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> and carry on most of their activities there and uh uh some <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> uh we have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> that we never use i mean might as well not even heat and cool it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		strange
 	
 	
 		well that's kind of the way our living room dining <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> is but it is nice to have it because there's uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		with our size of family it's nice to know that there's one that's always straight and clean if you have someone come just on the spur of the moment
 	
 	
 		right right
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		so you've been fairly happy with it how long have you been in it
 	
 	
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seventeen</NUMEX> years
 	
 	
 		wow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> it doesn't seem that long but it is because we uh came to this area about the same time
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		we've been fifteen fifteen <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> in the in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> that we're living in
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		and we the the principal feature i like about ours is that it's <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pier</ENAMEX> and beam
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">yours</ENAMEX> is a slab i assume
 	
 	
 		yes it is
 	
 	
 		yeah ours is a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pier</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">beam</ENAMEX> which has allowed me to go under it and do a whole lot of different things that i could not have done if it was slab i've done a lot of electrical and plumbing and other work that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		by myself and saved a lot of money that i couldn't have done if the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> was on a slab
 	
 	
 		well that's interesting well
 	
 	
 		but that's because it's so old it's uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty five thirty six years old</TIMEX> when they used to build like that and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		well my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> wouldn't do that anyway
 		that's his that's his worst thing in
 	
 	
 		i know he's not handy right
 		
 
 	
 	
 		life is to
 		have to repair something
 	
 	
 		i on the other hand seem um
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		do a lot too much of it and uh i've gotten good at it which in a in a way is bad because then you uh you start to take pleasure in it
 	
 	
 		well uh that's great uh we just kind of save everything for when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al</ENAMEX> uh for for when his uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> comes to visit and then
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		he does all the repairing you know he does
 	
 	
 		right
 		
 
 		my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> is actually uh
