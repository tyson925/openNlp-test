 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		well that's that's kind of interesting hobby what else do you you said you did cycling what was the other thing backpacking what
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah backpacking yeah i belong to a a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Boy Scout</ENAMEX> troop it beats paying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Way i</ENAMEX> just you know donate a whole bunch of my time to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boy Scouts</ENAMEX> and have fun
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		well you that's we have done that uh our <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> were in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boy Scouts</ENAMEX> and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> was in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Girl Scouts</ENAMEX> until just <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about a year ago</TIMEX> so we've  uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		done a fair amount of that in our spare time also  but it i that's a great thing to do you know really have you been backpacking anyplace exciting
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh well <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">just last weekend</TIMEX> went to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Davy Crockett Forest</ENAMEX> which is kind of out in east <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and we go to uh places out in uh
 		uh let's see what's that what's that state north of us that state yeah yeah that one that one yeah yeah and
 	
 	
 		oh that one okay  to the the uh oh by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fort Sill</ENAMEX> there do you
 	
 	
 		uh no to another fort uh a old <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fort</ENAMEX> that's out there trying to think of the name of it
 		darn uh yeah no sorry no memory
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh</ENAMEX> have have you gone like to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fillmont</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boy Scouts</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		no i missed out this <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> i wasn't able to get the time off but maybe <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</TIMEX> it's a good possibility
 	
 	
 		i've always thought that be a real fun thing to do
 	
 	
 		oh yeah  yeah when i was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX> uh we'd do the equivalent thing in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">High Sierras</ENAMEX> and that was loads of fun
 	
 	
 		um-hum does does your whole <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> like to do it like you you know for a vacation you'd go backpacking
 	
 	
 		uh no not quite because i'm not a whole family i'm just me
 	
 	
 		oh okay you just oh and and you volunteer for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boy Scouts</ENAMEX> huh
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i rent my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well  well sometimes sometimes uh
 	
 	
 		it's it's better than you know owning on them and making payments on them and you know things like that yeah
 	
 	
 		sometimes i think that might not be a bad idea  have uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you said you did it in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">High Sierras</ENAMEX> uh do you ever you know just vacation <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">someplace</ENAMEX> where you strictly backpack
 	
 	
 		oh yeah yeah uh  not recently because you know like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boy Scouts</ENAMEX> makes it so that i go like once a month you know someplace
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but uh there's uh some stuff some stuff that i want to do with like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sierra Club</ENAMEX> and go down the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grand Canyon</ENAMEX> or something like that
 		so you know they they have lots of tours where they get a bunch of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> together and off you go
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		which seems kind of reasonable because that means you don't have to take <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty thirteen year olds</TIMEX> with you it seems a little just a tad more relaxing
 	
 	
 		well i probably probably  that's uh  well my my other things that i like to do in my spare time i'm i like swimming
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		which is in now i've  done that and i i also  if i like something i usually try to figure out how to make money off of it
