 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		Jeri we're supposed to discuss crime in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> and what can be done about it
 	
 	
 		yes
 		that's a rather rather broad topic
 	
 	
 		they're usually pretty broad anyway
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		where do you live
 	
 	
 		uh we live in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Plano</ENAMEX> um and where are you
 	
 	
 		okay so  i'm in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Richardson</ENAMEX> so when i heard the topic i was thinking of the thing down at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">um Maceo High School</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		right right that is so frightening
 	
 	
 		it is you know
 	
 	
 		um do you have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> in school yeah
 	
 	
 		no <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mine</ENAMEX> are already in college now so uh i don't have to
 		at least when they were in high school it was beginning but not like the rampages
 	
 	
 		well i have my oldest is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">his first year</TIMEX> in high school so we have all this to to look forward to and it is really frightening um to think that you can't even
 		send them to school in safety i mean certainly you know you can't just turn them loose in the middle of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> but you know  when you can't even send them on their normal
 		activities in safety it it's really frightening
 	
 	
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		and uh  i really you know they're coming down on the principal but i really don't know
 		what they can do i mean it's just in so much of society
 		with the violence and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> having access to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> and i i really don't know what what can be done
 	
 	
 		yeah well i just i just don't understand how of course in my little world how <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX> could be so available
 	
 	
 		well  i don't either but apparently they just really are um
 		i mean you to me in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Plano</ENAMEX> you would think that would be about you know about as innocent as you could get for for being in a a large
 		area but you know my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> comes home and tells me that you know he hears <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> talk about having <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX> and um someone came to his football practice <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about two weeks ago</TIMEX> with a gun
 	
 	
 		oh my heavens
 	
 	
 		and i mean it just scared me to death and you know they called the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> and and nothing happened but my goodness you know it it could have easily
 	
 	
 		well maybe that's the answer to crime is getting  more prosecution
 	
 	
 		maybe so
 	
 	
 		you know because
 		i don't now i somehow i feel we're living in an impartial society
 		as far as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> seeing something happen you know across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> or
 		seeing someone get mugged or unfortunately raped and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> don't do anything
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> was raped in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Richardson</ENAMEX> i read in the paper oh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about a two weeks ago</TIMEX> now and all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> said they heard her yelling for help
 	
 	
 		oh no
 	
 	
 		but nobody nobody did anything
 	
 	
 		i just can't imagine that um
 	
 	
 		you know i mean they heard someone calling for help
 		nobody even called the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> to say you know i hear a strange screaming
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i'm afraid you know if you i don't blame <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s society about going out to help themselves because
 	
 	
 		right well i can see you know especially even if you heard screams from a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> or something not going over there maybe because you know it could be dangerous but certainly i can't understand not calling the police
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i
 	
 	
 		i just you know it's
 		it's really  frightening that we're not we're trying to live in our own little cocoons and probably one of the best things we could do for crime is to participate ourselves in its prevention
 	
 	
 		right well i i think you're right there i guess <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> just kind of keep their noses pointed in their own business but i think that's real dangerous and uh
 		i don't know i try tell my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> just just kind of be aware of what's around them you know and
 		if you see a situation that looks like it could be trouble just get out of it or call for help whichever but um
 	
 	
 		yes
 		yeah well you know the call for help is what scares me now because
 		it it just i don't know <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> just don't i don't know i can't say they don't care because <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> just have to care about another person
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but it's that not getting involved that impersonal
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">society i</ENAMEX> think we live in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		well maybe this thing with with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> at school maybe that'll  make <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> think a bit more and
 		you know take some steps to to correct it i don't know it's it really is is frightening i uh
 	
 	
 		yeah let me ask you getting back to your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX>'s football practice because it really sort of bothers me that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> aren't doing he didn't have a license for the gun correct
 	
 	
 		i don't know i mean i don't know the details this was not a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> that was on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> it was someone that
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">um</ENAMEX> showed you know just kind of showed up at the field
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um it was a a student age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> but i'm not even
