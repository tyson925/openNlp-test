 		right
 	
 	
 		you know and i would want to be a a good pet <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owner</ENAMEX> and i do have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> that uh
 		you know go off and leave their <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pets</ENAMEX> for what i think are just long periods of time and that seems so cruel to me
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		it is
 		you know i you know i'm home all the time or not all the time but um you know i'm home at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>

 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">cat</ENAMEX> and we lived up in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Dakota</ENAMEX> and i got her there at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Humane Society</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		somebody had dropped her off
 		but um
 		she's got a crooked tail and the whole bit
 	
 	
 		yeah well you know it's so  so often the uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> that come from the pound are the best ones
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh she's great she's you know she's a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> she'll sit with anybody she'll play with anybody
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and she's you know a a great cat
 	
 	
 		well you know it's  it's funny i mean i i know i really i'd like to have a pet i'm single and i know that you know there's a great therapeutic value
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh but like i say i'm i'm at this particular juncture in my life i i don't feel i would be a
 		you know a good uh uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> if you will for a for a pet but i know my <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">parents um</ENAMEX> had had uh
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		a pet for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> and then they that <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> died and they went for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several years</TIMEX> that they didn't have a pet and now they've got a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">German Shepherd</ENAMEX> that they are just nuts <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh great
 	
 	
 		and it's you know and it's great to see that because and you can just see that that you know it adds something to their lives
 	
 	
 		yeah it's it's great my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> is gone a lot
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and so she's great to have around
 	
 	
 		good company
 	
 	
 		you know when i'm you know sitting here by myself and
 		and have somebody at least something in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> you know besides sitting here by myself
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 	
 	
 		but that's a good thing i think when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are alone a lot
 	
 	
 		have you ever
 	
 	
 		then i think they're a great thing
 	
 	
 		have you ever thought of getting her a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">companion cat</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		no she's one that will not handle another cat
 	
 	
 		is that right very territorial huh
 	
 	
 		right um when they had her at at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Humane Society</ENAMEX> she was okay as long as she was by herself
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but as long as soon as i what i'm thinking as what they're thinking is that she was in a
 		in an environment with a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and what their thing is she got the broken tail with from a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> fight
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		and um it looks like well she was declawed and everything when they took her there and they just found her on the step
 		and uh they're thinking that she they couldn't handle her being with the other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and so they left her there and so i got her and you can tell when she's around other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> she'll pick a fight real fast
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but as long as she's by herself with us it's no problem she's really she's great with people
 	
 	
 		how old was she when you got her
 	
 	
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one year</TIMEX> old
 	
 	
 		yeah was that i mean that's one of the things i've often wondered about if you get an <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> that
 		you know i i always think about the idea of getting them whenever they're very young so it's i kind of always kind of wonder how well they adjust or how long it takes them you know as an adult
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		uh she adjusted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the that same day</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		yeah she was great you know she
 	
 	
 		she said this is home huh
 	
 	
 		yeah she says this is home she knew right where the bed was she laid on my pillow she you know did everything she laid on me on my stomach and you know went right to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> litter box and where that was and she was great
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that's great
 		yeah
 		yeah i
 	
 	
 		i think she was a good cat it's just that the other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> were a problem for her
 	
 	
 		yeah i have a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> who has a uh a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> that she got from the pound
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		well actually i take that back she didn't get it from the pound she found it in her yard okay and you know and it was just the poor <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> was just a mess it was the most horrible looking thing and of course her heart went out to it and she started feeding it and the next thing you know she had a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		um
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and it turned into a beautiful animal long hair lot of hair and an odd markings and i think it you know is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heinz Fifty</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> variety but really a a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">handsome cat</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh great
 		oh
 	
 	
 		but the crazy thing about it is this <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> has a severe allergy to <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fleas</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		so she has to she she bathes the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> with this special you know uh uh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">formula medicine</ENAMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vet</ENAMEX> gave her and which i had never heard of anyone bathing a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> but it you know
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh
 	
 	
 		fairly regularly she bathes this <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> you know is not  not particularly crazy about it but at the same time has kind of gotten used to it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and it sits really wild i couldn't i couldn't believe it whenever she was telling he well i got to you know bathe my <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>
