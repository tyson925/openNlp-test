 
     		
 	
 		yeah they just raised our taxes up here <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about a year</TIMEX> ago
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well they've uh statewide raises they raise ours it seems like constantly we just uh passed a new one
 		uh fortunately or unfortunately it doesn't go into effect because we did not get the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Airlines</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh right <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indianapolis</ENAMEX> got that didn't they
 	
 	
 		right and uh we had passed a
 		a provisional one that if if it did if they did locate here we would raise our taxes
 		but uh at least we thought we'd get something back from that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh how do you feel about taxes
 	
 	
 		oh it seems like a big politics game like up here <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX>'s up for reelection so
 		he said the budget was fine and that the state didn't have any money and then right after he won the election he said we owed a lot of money so they raised all our taxes
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and now it's election time again so they're trying to lower them
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so they're just talk about lowering them but they never do they just keep raising them
 	
 	
 		i've never seen taxes really go down
 	
 	
 		yeah me neither well actually they're going to here because they didn't have a budget for so long so they raised the tax rate real high for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last three months of this year</TIMEX> and they're gonna lower it for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		i guess they figure they're gonna make up for all they didn't get when they should've had a budget
 	
 	
 		i hope they put that in writing
 	
 	
 		yeah  yeah they say they're gonna lower but i'll see
 	
 	
 		i feel like the middle class <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are supporting the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>  and uh that the rich are not paying their share and of course the poor
 		can't afford it either but uh i really feel like and and i feel like you know i'm a middle class person
 		income incomewise anyway and uh i get tired of supporting the whole country
 	
 	
 		yeah so do i i mean i'm a a middle class barely but uh i don't think the rich are paying more let not enough i think they're paying too much
 	
 	
 		you think the rich are paying too much
 	
 	
 		yeah i mean if you're in the the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">three three percent</NUMEX> bracket and they take a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> of your check <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every month</TIMEX> well that's ridiculous why bother working
 	
 	
 		well i don't know many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rich</ENAMEX> that don't have enough tax breaks to i mean i'm talking about the really rich
 	
 	
 		well they should just tax everybody the same amount no matter what you make
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		that'd be fair
 	
 	
 		now i'll go along with that i you know
 	
 	
 		yeah no loopholes or anything everybody pays <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> percent or fifteen or whatever
 	
 	
 		right now i think that would be fair and i you know
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		no no ifs ands and buts you know no big elaborate laws that say uh you know call for a lot of enforcement or a lot of review it's just
 		you know you make this you pay <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> percent  if you make a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">hundred dollars</NUMEX> you pay <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> percent if you make <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a million dollars</NUMEX> you pay <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> percent
 	
 	
 		yeah that's the way our state tax is here
 		i think it's pretty fair
 	
 	
 		our state taxes are somewhat based on the federal
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		and uh  they have not gotten it  where the withholding is accurate
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so and and you withhold no matter what you do they withhold what they're supposed to and at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the year</TIMEX> it's not enough
 	
 	
 		oh great so you ought to be saving up some <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every month</TIMEX> to make up for all what they should be taking out
 	
 	
 		right so now you know when you sign your W-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> form or whatever <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W-2</ENAMEX> whatever that is then they always say do you want a extra amount for state
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 	
 	
 		which is ridiculous but it's been that way for the last probably <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten years</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah i guess you you have to check yes or you come down to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the year</TIMEX> and you don't have it to give it to them
 	
 	
 		right unless you have a lot of deductions but you know if you have a lot of federal deduction it ends up hurting you statewise
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		really
 	
 	
 		and you end up owing  you know you may get <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">nine hundred dollars</NUMEX> back from federal and you're gonna owe  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fifteen hundred</NUMEX> in the state
 	
 	
 		ouch
 	
 	
 		and uh it's it's just ridiculous but i i don't know i've they just came up with a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">twenty five percent</NUMEX> increase on personal property in in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oklahoma</ENAMEX> county
 		and that is a chunk
 	
 	
 		yeah i'll say
 	
 	
 		i mean <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">twenty five percent</NUMEX> increase
 	
 	
 		yeah
