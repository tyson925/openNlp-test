 
     		
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">okay</ENAMEX> is it <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike</ENAMEX> do you repair your own car
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yes
 		i try to whenever i can i've always been a a i guess a product of a handyman father
 	
 	
 		well i tell you what that's your count your blessings because uh it's really is good when someone can do some
 	
 	
 		the
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		things to the the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> themselves
 	
 	
 		yeah there's  although i'll tell you you know over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> get more complicated and
 	
 	
 		well that's why i don't do as much as i'd like
 	
 	
 		right yeah
 	
 	
 		because they are i mean they got they've gotten complicated haven't they
 	
 	
 		yes one of my <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> was a fifty <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buick</ENAMEX> which after awhile i could you know take it apart in my sleep if i needed to
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		is that right
 	
 	
 		yeah it it got to be pretty straightforward to understand and and uh since then you know and the closer a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> is to a fifty <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buick</ENAMEX> the the more i know about it and then start getting into these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nissans</ENAMEX> and the like and i just can't keep up
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah i i agree about all i ever i never was too mechanically inclined but i used to always change my own <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> and do the points and plugs and  course they don't use uh points anymore
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that's right yeah
 	
 	
 		but they do still use plugs and uh now brakes i've always done a lot uh you know changing brakes  and i used to
 	
 	
 		yep yep
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		do i could always do the alternator you know and starter i don't anymore but i have on a lot a lot of times
 	
 	
 		yes
 		yes i understand my last <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> repair actually had to do with brakes and it's one i did not do myself i took the car my i have a seventy <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">El Dorado</ENAMEX> took it to be inspected
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and the parking brake failed so i got under there and messed with the the tension that um that adjustment to make it to tighten tighten it up and that didn't do the trick and i got there and tried to
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		it probably slipped loose didn't it
 	
 	
 		but we well actually that wasn't even eventually the problem i i did a lot of things that i i did everything that i could think to do
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and eventually i brought it up to a a place called <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Just Brakes</ENAMEX> and it turns out that there's a the parking brake in in the rear there's a there's disc brakes and the parking brake is a piston
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		deal and because the parking brake hadn't been used in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">so many years</TIMEX> the piston froze up so they ended up having to pound it out and one of them they
 	
 	
 		hm
 		oh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		were able to get running uh kind of oiling it and playing with it and the other one they just it was just frozen solid the so i ended up having to buy <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> and altogether all total it was just under <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">two hundred dollars</NUMEX> believe it or not to get all that done
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah well it really wasn't quite so as bad as you thought would it was it
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah actually i i think it was a lot of money but i guess i don't like i said yeah but i it got to the point where i didn't know what was going on so  that's right that's right
 	
 	
 		well it was a lot of money but
 		you had to have the help didn't you yeah
 		well do you still do much work on them now
 	
 	
 		i do that actually that actually that was just um in in in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">beginning of September</TIMEX> and i whenever i can i do try i  actually actually i'd say this i i've gotten to the point where i don't change the oil anymore only because
 	
 	
 		disposal is a problem
 	
 	
 		well that is one problem but also these um these fast oil change places you just can't beat them for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixteen</TIMEX> bucks they'll not only will they change your <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">ten minutes</TIMEX> and do a fine you know  good a job as i can do but they'll uh lube too
 	
 	
 		
  
 		that's true that's true
 		right that that i've i've quit doing that myself and but one of the main reasons was the disposal of the oil you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yep that's right
 	
 	
 		and uh but but no i guess it that and the main reason that it's
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it's quick
