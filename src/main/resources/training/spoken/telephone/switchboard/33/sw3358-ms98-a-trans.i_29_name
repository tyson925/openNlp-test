 
     		
 	
 		okay um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i'm very unhandy in these things and uh i don't like to do anything myself
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i like to have a service station
 		i can feel confident about
 	
 	
 		yeah i uh
 	
 	
 		which is problematical
 	
 	
 		i've been working on my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> since or actually on on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> since i was probably <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about fourteen</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh i've i've got a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixty six</TIMEX> Mustang out in the back that i've been trying to get running here lately that's given me a lot of problems and the the clutch and stuff isn't working out right
 		and every time i try to put the battery in it doesn't have enough charge on it so i have to take it over to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and get it charged up again try try it again it rained here <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all last week</TIMEX> so i didn't get a chance to do it
 	
 	
 		oh is it is the problem that it's hard to get the appropriate battery and other types of things for a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a sixty six</TIMEX> car
 	
 	
 		uh no it's not  i don't know exactly what it is with the battery i think it's just that  every time i charge it up it it has to sit
 		i i i went and got a new battery and brought it home and then it sat there for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks</TIMEX> so i went over to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and charged it up
 		and then it started raining so i haven't been able to do it for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">another week</TIMEX> so i'll have to take it over there and get it charged again and maybe i'll be able to see if that won't get it going tomorrow
 		but uh
 		but my main problem's been my clutch i
 	
 	
 		is do you rely on this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> for for primary transportation or just excuse me
 	
 	
 		i'm supposed to
 	
 	
 		i'm sorry
 	
 	
 		i said i said i'm supposed to
 		it uh it's been down for quite some time now and i been having a lot of trouble with it
 	
 	
 		so  are you struggling to get around as a result
 	
 	
 		yeah i have to rely on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> and stuff like that
 		so you you don't do any kind of car work or
 	
 	
 		i try not to um
 	
 	
 		try not to anyway yeah
 		i can understand that
 	
 	
 		i suppose i ought to learn to change the oil and things i can save a lot of money doing that
 	
 	
 		yeah i think
 		i can understand that i it's not the most fun in the world but
 		it it like you said it is it is cheaper on yourself to to go ahead and do it yourself than go spend fifty <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixty</TIMEX> dollars to have somebody else you know just change your <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> or something like that
 	
 	
 		i mean it must be great to to to really understand what's what's going on and you can both do things yourself and  talk confidently with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> when you have to take it somewhere to get parts or whatever
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		that's that i think that's what my next option is if the if the clutch doesn't work right to take it to somebody and see if they can't decipher what the problem is
 		i i have a feeling maybe it's just that i've i've put too strong of a clutch in it because i've got it's a it's a straight <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six two hundred</NUMEX> with a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">three</NUMEX> speed transmission in it
 		and i've tried to put a racing clutch in it which i think is gonna you know i think that may be what my problem is it's it's too much clutch for the amount of engine i've got
 		but uh
 		we'll see
 	
 	
 		was it easy to get
 		a more appropriate clutch
 	
 	
 		pardon
 		yeah it's it i just go to my neighborhood <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parts store</ENAMEX> and get another one it's that when i when i had to rebuilt engine engine rebuilt i decided to try a um a better clutch so that i'd quit changing them out <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every six months</TIMEX>
 		i i have a slight lead foot
 	
 	
 		you have a slight
 	
 	
 		a slight lead foot yes
 		it means it means i've always got my foot in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> and and and the other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> in the in the clutch so i i burn up the clutch a lot
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		it's not good for it
 		but uh
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		any any questions you have about uh anything anything easy to to work on or whatever or are you trying to get yourself into working on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> or what
 	
 	
 		well
 		the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> i drove is an <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eighty four</NUMEX> and it's reached the point
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		where various things are are going wrong with it and it's had to be in recently
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it needed a new battery it wouldn't start um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> and i did manage to to uh recharge the battery from the other <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car um</ENAMEX> and the exhaust system has needed work and um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh so  the latest work done it just <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> was to have the front wheels aligned
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh so we've been spending
 	
 	
 		don't don't don't tell me let me guess your warranty just ran out and now everything goes wrong right
 	
 	
 		yes in fact   in fact on the battery uh
 		uh it's the old one it had a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four year</TIMEX> warranty and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> it gave up was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four years</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> days
 	
 	
 		typical  i i don't i don't know what it is somehow another car <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturers</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturers</ENAMEX> of new parts for them
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		they put their warranties on there and they know exactly when they're gonna run out when the when the part is gonna is gonna break down
