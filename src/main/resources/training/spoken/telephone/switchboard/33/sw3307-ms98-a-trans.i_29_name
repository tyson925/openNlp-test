 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		um i kept a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</TIMEX> budget for so long i don't have one now but i sort of know where it is i know where my expenses are and how much i have to cover them how about you
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well i don't have anything um a budget written down per se but however i i know exactly where my money goes for the most part as far as expenses yes um-hum
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 		do you do
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i think in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this day</TIMEX> and time we need something like that don't we
 	
 	
 		yes
 		i keep hearing that we're supposed to pay ourselves <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> and set aside our savings first are you are you able to do that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		that helps doesn't it
 	
 	
 		yes it does
 	
 	
 		back when we were i'm i take it you may be past raising a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> is that true
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		that back in those other <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> we couldn't do that could we
 	
 	
 		no other things came took priority
 	
 	
 		
 
 		like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> bills and things like that
 	
 	
 		um-hum that's for sure
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um are you planning ahead for retirement through your your uh savings and things
 	
 	
 		yes you know that's interesting because i was talking at someone in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> just <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this morning</TIMEX> about the retirement and what we would like to have when we retire and how we're going to get there
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		it's really hard to anticipate in advance what you think you're going to need okay and then try and plan now
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		because things come up
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but i think now we're at the age where it's really very important
 	
 	
 		well one of the things that my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> has he he works with financial things and uh he's been trying to
 	
 	
 		you know
 	
 	
 		he keeps saying well we need to sit and find out how much we want and and i think that's true but like you said it's hard to do
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the things that we've done towards that is um buy nursing home insurance
 		have you all thought of that
 	
 	
 		oh no i hadn't even thought about that we have investments to uh alleviate some of the
 		cost of our old age hopefully in in terms of uh an apartment <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		we've been partnership with uh some other people
 	
 	
 		oh that's sounds
 		that sounds good
 	
 	
 		but it's not going to provide
 		a whole bunch of money i mean it it might might pay the utilities
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know at at that point in time
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> and hopefully our investments with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> will help our retirement our retirement years
 	
 	
 		well the uh if you have the retirement <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">fund</ENAMEX> at place like that they're usually fairly good
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i know mine i'm we've gone through some mergers and my retirement has
 		has ended uh the plan has ended <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> different times this year
 	
 	
 		is that right
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		that's not very encouraging is it
 	
 	
 		uh no because uh of the changes that came about in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> requirements and then in uh in merger requirements
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but um my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> was looking into the nursing home insurance is it's it's really is an investment you hope you never have you use
 		but uh you have to be so careful of what it will pay and what it won't pay
 	
 	
 		when you buy something like that in advance how can you be sure that well i guess you don't really buy into the nursing home do you
 	
 	
 		oh no no it's an insurance policy
 	
 	
 		you buy
 		it's a policy that will pay for your nursing home should you need it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		it pays a set amount
 	
 	
 		
 
 		hum
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		and you talk to your insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> about there's special <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> now that are doing it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and they set them up i know ours is a set amount <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</TIMEX> and it has a maximum amount over a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty month</TIMEX> period
 		and uh it you know it has you need to read the policy and look into what it covers
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i guess i'm conscious of that because my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>'s in a nursing home
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and uh i think we we learn from our experiences
 	
 	
 		oh i think that's very true and that brings it more to home when it happens close to home
 	
 	
 		yeah it does
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		i think one of the main things that we in the past always talked about was not having any major expenses to budget for when we do retire
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		and if you got that covered
 		i want to travel personally and i want to be able to get around
 	
 	
 		oh yes
 		oh yes
 	
 	
 		don't we all right
 	
 	
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two three</NUMEX> trips including a cruise every year
 	
 	
 		at least
 	
 	
 		at least
 	
 	
 		at least
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know
 	
 	
 		well it sounds like we have some good plans anyway
 	
 	
 		it would sounds like we do
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh you're you're leaning more towards investments and things like that to do yours then
 	
 	
 		right i don't know how sound that is perhaps your way is is a is a more sound proposition you know
 	
 	
 		well we do that too
 		you know you can't then the insurance policies are just things to kind of buffer in case of unexpected things
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		um-hum and that will always happen
 	
 	
 		oh yes but uh
 		the investments are something that you have to plan for and get your
 		there was some new things
