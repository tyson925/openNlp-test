 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sid</ENAMEX> have you established what kind of requirements you're looking for for your next vehicle
 	
 	
 		well i don't know if i really have  a a lot of uh requirements uh
 		i guess i look at uh getting the best deal uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		as as my main objectives normally
 		whoever is willing to deal and and give me a good price
 	
 	
 		okay well i i tend to
 		be more methodical i guess uh
 		i determine
 		<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of all what i'm gonna use the vehicle for
 		whether it's going to be primarily as a family mover or as a a personal mover uh where it's gonna be driven you know what types
 		of uh driving
 		i'm going to be doing on it primarily <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">highway</ENAMEX> or or local mileage more often
 		and uh
 		hanging in the back of my mind is always the knowledge that i tend to drive <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about ten years</TIMEX>
 		at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred</NUMEX> fifty to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two hundred thousand</NUMEX> miles
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so i'm
 		i'm real picky if if if you're gonna keep something that long  you know you better get something that you wanted to begin with and that you're you're gonna like for a long time
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i don't know i've had pretty good luck you know even if if you take any car and and you care for it well enough uh you're gonna get some good life out of it uh
 		i my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oldsmobile</ENAMEX> right now that i have uh is getting near <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eighty thousand</NUMEX> and still in
 		pretty good shape uh there was a flaw in there where a where a head gasket bolt broke
 		and it cost me some bucks to to fix that but that was you know something that
 		was unforeseen
 		but i still think i can i'm gonna get probably <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred fifty thousand</NUMEX> or more out of it
 	
 	
 		sure well it sounds like you tend to drive your <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> quite a ways a also then
 	
 	
 		well i i drive like the song says the little old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lady</ENAMEX> but uh but not from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pasadena</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but uh yeah i i baby them ah as much as i possibly can
 		it's a pretty big expense nowadays uh
 		and i guess i like to take care of it uh so i don't have to buy one
 		too often
 	
 	
 		that's true uh do you have
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one one than one</NUMEX> vehicle in your fleet uh do you have a family <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">fleet</ENAMEX> or
 	
 	
 		yeah i i i got an old uh seventy <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh Grand Fury</ENAMEX> that uh doesn't wanna die on me so i i just keep running the thing
 		don't wanna sell it or get rid of it until it it quits but it just doesn't seem to want to
 		i'll probably have uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three four hundred thousand</NUMEX> before it wants to die
 	
 	
 		well that may be they <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> made some really good old engines back then like the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the three eighteen</TIMEX> was particularly an exceptionally good engine
 	
 	
 		it's got the big <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three sixty</TIMEX> in there gas guzzler but
 		it runs good
 	
 	
 		yeah at the moment i've got a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cadillac Cimarron</ENAMEX> which is approaching its <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">tenth</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> of age and a uh
 		reasonably new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Plymouth Voyager</ENAMEX> it's only a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of years old</TIMEX>
 		but that's the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> one of of those that we've had that's the the family travel <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicle</ENAMEX> you know not only does it do all the
 		the uh carpooling around
 		during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the week</TIMEX> but it's also the vacation <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicle</ENAMEX> that we all drive in
 		i think that what i'm getting ready to get next is probably a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Suburban</ENAMEX> unless they drastically change
 		the
 		the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicle</ENAMEX> a lot uh i'm just getting tired of
 		when i do get hung up in traffic not being able to determine what the problem is and and come to some resolution
 		of
 		whether it's better to sit in the traffic light and wait or get off at the next exit that kind of stuff just because i can't see
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm too my <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cimarron</ENAMEX> is just so small and so low to the ground that i can't see past any vehicle that's in front of me
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah well i i'm considering probably some kind of a pickup <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">truck</ENAMEX> myself for
 		the next <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicle</ENAMEX> uh i just have so many hauling projects a lot of times and
 		uh
 		uh i'd like to just start doing some uh
 		uh carpentry uh type work around and
 		i just feel that
