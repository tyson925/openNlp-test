 
     		
 	
 		um i guess i i've rented most of the time so i i haven't done much home repair uh i do small little little odd jobs
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah i i live here at home with my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> and uh
 		not too long ago uh
 		we uh put in a a storage <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> out in the in the back part of our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hall</ENAMEX> here we took took part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garage</ENAMEX> and turned it into inside of the house
 		and walled it off and put cabinets and stuff in and
 		took  a good gee probably <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two months</TIMEX> to do all of it working on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekends</TIMEX> and stuff like that
 	
 	
 		yeah i i worked uh with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> uh it was quite <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few years ago</TIMEX> uh
 		and um he built uh his own <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> stuff like that and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i i helped him quite a bit as from from everything from the carpentry work right electrical plumbing just about everything
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so it was kind of fun to do that
 	
 	
 		yeah the i uh i worked construction on a a new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Airlines</ENAMEX> building out here for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">couple of weeks</TIMEX>
 		hanging hanging <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> stories off a side of a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> from scaffolding isn't my idea of fun
 	
 	
 		
 
 		no no no no that's uh
 	
 	
 		i prefer to keep my feet on the ground and  stuff like that  but uh
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		no i had a have a job kind of
 		delves into uh construction a little bit where uh we worked on wooden railroad <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridges</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh some of them uh in the country
 		uh get pretty high and and you're overlooking uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh a small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> of water mostly rocks down there and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i can imagine that's uh
 	
 	
 		and you're just
 		yeah so uh it's not fun to work too high but uh you know the uh i think more what they're talking about is into the the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		yeah the the home improvement stuff
 	
 	
 		basically most of that i've  you know done some minor minor repairs electrically and minor repairs plumbing uh stuff like
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		my my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> and i are always having to fix light switches or put in new new uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outlets</ENAMEX> and stuff because you know mama wants another another outlet somewhere so we
 		go climbing <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">around</NUMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">attic</ENAMEX> and dropping wire and cutting holes in the wall
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i i enjoy doing a lot of projects like that but not alone
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		i i prefer having someone that uh has some knowledge in that and
 		and i uh help and learn and uh go that route but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		if i had to tackle something you know building an addition totally by myself uh i wouldn't enjoy it at all
 	
 	
 		yeah it's it doing something like that you have to you have to plan it all out and make sure that you've got all your your measurements and calculations down before you ever even start to knock a hole in a wall or something you know
 	
 	
 		yeah uh
 	
 	
 		but uh we didn't i mean we that that <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> that we built we put they we built cabinets and stuff and made a little desk top and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mom</ENAMEX> put uh
 		uh some tile on the on the desk top so it's it's like a it's it's a  just a flat <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> that has tile on it
 	
 	
 		hm
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it she doesn't she doesn't ever go back and sit in it or write on it or anything i think she just did it for decoration
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		but uh
 	
 	
 		well sounds like quite a project there
 	
 	
 		yeah it was it was sometimes fun
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i guess lot of times when uh i don't know
 		when you're pressed for time and have to do it and
 		wanna get it done then it doesn't become fun anymore
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i think the the smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">projects</ENAMEX> tend to be more fun something you can finish in you know maybe <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a week</TIMEX> or something but
 	
 	
 		yeah thing things that that that take a long time or you're doing them in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the middle of the summer</TIMEX> when it's hot is is not fun
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah well uh especially uh stuff like roofing when you're doing it in
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		ninety to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred</NUMEX> degree weather and uh
 	
 	
 		and the sun's bouncing off the roof to start with and so yeah it's even hotter and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah for sure
 	
 	
 		working with uh the the black the black tar paper it that stuff gets really hot
 	
 	
 		yeah and then it almost seems like lot of that uh tile up there is is almost starting to melt in your hands
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's real hard to handle
 	
 	
 		yep
 	
 	
 		well i don't know about you but i'm i'm about out uh
 	
 	
 		yeah i i i i think we're at a at a loss here
 	
 	
 		yeah so i think we'll just end it short
 	
 	
 		okay it was nice talking to you bye-bye
 	
 	
 		yeah bye
