 
     		
 	
 		um i think we can have honest government what do you think
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well i think there are honest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> i think it's uh
 		and we do have some checks and balances to keep it honest but i think it's always a real challenge to um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		make sure that we have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in there that we can count on
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		to be honest
 	
 	
 		well
 		i've thought about the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> that go in and you know they say none of them are honest but i think they're honest when they go in they just keep
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		facing these challenges and not all of them respond favorably to them
 	
 	
 		yeah i think there are and have been some things that have been done to maybe
 		make things better you know one thing is the opportunity on our income tax to um allow certain donations
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		to uh be made because a a lot of times i think you know <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> anybody that runs for a political <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> has got to either be independently wealthy
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		or they've got to be beholding to somebody to help them
 	
 	
 		yeah some special interest group
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and so you know i think  if if there were ways that we could get away from that and let just the common <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> be able to run
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> that that
 	
 	
 		and
 		yeah and of course he runs into a problem he may not can support the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> and all of the other things even though they have a high salary
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but
 		it's just uh i think public service was originally meant for public service but it it's gotten to where it's kind of rather hard to do
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		as public service you know
 		they need uh money to operate on and this and that and feed their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> and put their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> in college just like everybody else does
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		and that puts stress
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah well my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> has um held public <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> for a while and not a paid  public <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> i might add  and uh  if
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		oh
 		that's public service
 	
 	
 		yeah that's more public service i guess than public <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> and it's been a real eye-opener to us course i feel that he's completely honest and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		hm
 		yes
 	
 	
 		what all and there have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> been <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that have said
 		you know that they
 		how much is he being paid and all this kind of stuff to to do things and
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		you always have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> throwing stones don't you
 	
 	
 		yeah well obviously if they ever looked at our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> or  our <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> or whatever they would know he's not getting paid anything but um
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah well uh
 		i guess that that uh it's it's the way <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> perceive and they perceive from their own wants too sometimes
 	
 	
 		yeah i think that's true
 	
 	
 		yeah they want somebody else in so they've got to find something wrong with whoever's there
 	
 	
 		yeah that's probably true too
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		but at the same time you know when i go to the polls to vote
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		um i always  am real nervous about who i'm voting for even if i have studied the issues and heard what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have had to say and everything because
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um you don't know really know that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> you know and you don't know even if what they say is what they're gonna do and what their real feelings are on a lot of things i mean
 	
 	
 		no you don't
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		well sometimes they don't know that what they say is what they gonna do
 	
 	
 		absolutely
 	
 	
 		and depends on the situation and that makes it very difficult
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i guess that's a real problem you know i i i don't know how we solve that one because i'm not sure that you can ever especially the the higher up you go you know like a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senator</ENAMEX> or
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">congressman</ENAMEX> or something like that i don't know how you would ever get to know any of those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> well enough to say you know i know this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> on a personal basis i know he has integrity and i know he
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know
 	
 	
 		and to go by voting records and that isn't always right
 	
 	
 		yeah or or just read the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">League of Women Voters</ENAMEX> answers that they give or
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah so it's sometimes you just don't know
 	
 	
 		no i just uh
 		kind of do the best you can isn't it
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		yeah well what do you think about um um the legality or making it illegal to do certain things do you think that helps
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		calling them accountable from a a law standpoint
 	
 	
 		well that would be nice if we could do that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well i know uh some of them the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate Ethics Committee</ENAMEX> is trying to do that
 		but uh it's really strange that they find someone totally guilty of something and then they go back and talk to their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">constituency</ENAMEX> and i'm thinking about <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> in particular
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh then the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">constituency</ENAMEX> says oh well he's honest and we want him you know
 	
 	
 		oh i can think of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> like that also  just blows your mind doesn't it oh think so
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm sure we both can
 		yeah it sure does and then they've proved that he's lined his pockets and everything else
 	
 	
 		yeah oh yeah
 	
 	
 		but i
