 
     		
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		so what do you <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> having up there i haven't been up there since oh Lord <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">forty eight</NUMEX> i guess  well no no it wasn't forty <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> it was it was uh
 	
 	
 		<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">forty eight</NUMEX> that's a long time  um
 	
 	
 		let's see yeah it was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">forty eight</NUMEX> i was in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX>
 		we did an we did an air show out at uh out at uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bowling Green</ENAMEX> no out at um <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrews</ENAMEX> yeah
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Andrews</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so what's it been like up there
 	
 	
 		well for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past week or two</TIMEX> it's been cold and wet
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but before that for  most of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> it's been hot and dry
 	
 	
 		yeah uh like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September</TIMEX> was hot and drier <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		um <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September</TIMEX>'s really was i'm not sure about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX> i think for about twelve <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September</TIMEX> the the average temperature had been higher than normal each month
 	
 	
 		really huh
 	
 	
 		um lots of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ninety</NUMEX> degree <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> during the summer
 	
 	
 		it really has been strange here <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> i mean this whole year course this whole year has been a different year in more ways than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> but uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		we had uh you you know all these we have all these uh uh somebody said you know you're either a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stranger</ENAMEX> or a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fool</ENAMEX> if you try to predict <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">weather</ENAMEX> but
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		we had all these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> saying it was gonna be the hottest <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> ever you know and we had all this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rain</ENAMEX> and it really is not a bad <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> at all really cool but all of a sudden in in um in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		good
 	
 	
 		um <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September October</TIMEX> it got real hot and dry and just stayed that way for a long time
 		then uh then <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of October</TIMEX> it started rain <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">almost a week</TIMEX> without stopping just pouring down you know and flash floods everywhere and that kind of deal
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and then uh uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">end of November the first like the second week</TIMEX> um you know <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first week</TIMEX> actually we had we had a freeze
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yep
 	
 	
 		and the average you know the average uh first frost is like the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">fifteenth</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November</TIMEX> here but usually it's not until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later</TIMEX> it's really strange
 	
 	
 		oh if you had it early
 		yeah i think we usually have a frost in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um
 		but you know we really need the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rain</ENAMEX> that we've been getting and it has not <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> but the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last few days</TIMEX> it's been been pouring <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">most of the day</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		is it is it is it flooding anywhere
 	
 	
 		is it flooding anywhere i have not heard of it any problems of it flooding anywhere i mean that's occurred certainly at times in the past but uh no i've not heard of any particular problems this time
 	
 	
 		it just kind of uh cloud we're supposed to to have a chance to get some rain <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next couple of days</TIMEX> here uh which will be you know a little bit more typical uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">autumn</TIMEX> weather
 		but really it's strange we haven't really had an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">autumn</TIMEX> it's like we went into <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> without you know the the poor <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> said what  what's that
 	
 	
 		yes
 		yeah yeah yeah we had we had uh summer lasting long and then it then it then it became <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> like
 	
 	
 		yeah uh uh and
 	
 	
 		uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> it's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> it's it's sort of change it's warmer to sort of more typical <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">autumn day</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah there you you know usually there's uh i have a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a farm a hundred miles</NUMEX> east of here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East Texas</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		and you know all these huge <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> just like the eastern hard wood belt all the way up to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maine</ENAMEX> you know it's that same <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees pines</ENAMEX> and and hard woods you know hickories and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">oaks</ENAMEX> and stuff and um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i was up there <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last weekend</TIMEX> and there are <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> that that still have their leaves on and they're green but they're dead
 		you know the freeze the freeze just got them they they weren't ready for it at all apparently and and we haven't had a typical fall at all no not much color and you know changes have a color at all
 	
 	
 		guess not
 	
 	
 		really weird this year
 		i'm not sure what that what that means
 	
 	
 		i don't know yeah our leaves are are all on the on the ground now i think it was a especially good <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fall</TIMEX> colors
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so you you all actually had some color huh  it kind of crept in and
 	
 	
 		the oh yeah yeah oh yeah we we did for a time
 	
 	
 		yeah it's usually beautiful up there isn't it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh gorgeous that's yeah i'd i'd say you could drive along in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maryland</ENAMEX>
 		and and look at the sweet <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gum</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> on each side and the and the pines and what not and and you could you know you could be driving along <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East Texas</ENAMEX> and it looks just the same it's almost you know identical identical kind of country
 	
 	
 		um-hum but not <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> for the leaves
 	
 	
 		beautiful yeah oh really
 		yeah i was up i was up there cutting some firewood <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this weekend</TIMEX>  yeah
 		pull little oak <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> that was dead and
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		cut it up and split it  it was kind of fun
 	
 	
 		yeah this is because it it can't tolerate a freeze this early is that right
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		if it would came later it'd be all right
 	
 	
 		uh it it there's some trees like the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">oaks</ENAMEX> like a white oak seem to be pretty hearty that nothing bothers them their <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">leaves</ENAMEX> are still green
 		and some of the other <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">oaks</ENAMEX> there are a few <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">oaks</ENAMEX> that have lost their leaves um what i notice mostly is the red maples
 		the the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">leaves</ENAMEX> are just dead the dogwoods look still look you know they got uh bit on the ends of leaf a little bit but they still look pretty good
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		it just depends on the on the uh on the tree
