 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		all right
 	
 	
 		so what was the last <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> repair that you had done on your car
 	
 	
 		well we have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> and on our little <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Honda</ENAMEX> we had to replace some CV <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">joints</ENAMEX> and on our bigger car it's a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chevrolet</ENAMEX> we had to repair
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		the control module
 	
 	
 		the control module a mystery box huh
 	
 	
 		uh yeah
 		yeah yeah right so we've had just recently a couple of things the CV joints my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> just did himself and i'm glad he can do that because that saves us lots
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that's that's impressive he's able to do a job like that because that requires special tools
 	
 	
 		lots of money
 		yes he does and he's lucky in that way too because his his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> lives real close and he has a lot of the tools
 	
 	
 		oh that's interesting
 	
 	
 		so so he's able to do quite a few things like that and saves quite a bit of money
 	
 	
 		that that's great what
 		what kind of jobs would you <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folks</ENAMEX> repair refer refer to a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garage</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um well we had to have the the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chevrolet</ENAMEX> had to be repair done by a repair man the you know the control module and even though that
 		that still hasn't been taken of in fact we were driving along <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the other night</TIMEX> and the engine light came back on but
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> wouldn't the repair <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> when he fixed it said that it looks like um the computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> or or the whatever it was needed to be replaced also and we didn't have it done at the time so it looks like we'll need to go back in and
 		have that done
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		so how about yourself
 	
 	
 		well um the last thing that i had to have done to my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> uh i wound up doing myself and um that was uh tuning it up
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and um i had been having a a problem where i would be driving along and and i would notice this at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> when i'd be sitting at a light i would see smoke in my uh
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		my headlights and uh then later on when you know i'd i'd get out wherever i was going i would smell uh something had been burning
 	
 	
 		oh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and i pretty much figured it was oil because i'd looked under the hood a couple of times and there was a a lot more oil sort of floating around than you should have on a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Honda</ENAMEX> which i ironically have too
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you'd expect the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> to be really clean inside
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and it run real well real well and so anyway i i had been thinking about it for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a long time</TIMEX> and discovered that um
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> or i had decided that what had happened is there's a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a</NUMEX> a little piece of metal that sits there over the top of the valve <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX> called the valve uh uh cover
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh i decided that there must be something wrong with the gasket or perhaps the the whole cover itself hadn't been uh tightened down well or whatever and so
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		when i was doing this tune up i decided it was time for me to explore
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and sure enough that's what the problem was
 	
 	
 		my word huh
 	
 	
 		and so i went out and i got a new gasket and slipped it in there
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and on on older <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> up to i i in fact i have no idea when they started doing this but but on the older <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> they used to make the gasket out of a cork like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">material</ENAMEX> and on this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> they make it out of a rubber like material
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so uh
 	
 	
 		oh so do you enjoy doing the repairs yourself
 	
 	
 		yeah up to a certain point i used to do a lot more of it when i was younger than i do now um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and i have to admit that when the weather starts to get cold there's just no fun like a busted knuckle i just uh i just can't even tell you the joy i get from that experience and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		right
 		right
 		oh well that's what my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> says too he says when you have the right tools and a good place to do it in it's it's enjoyable and he really likes to be able to to do it but when you don't have the right tools
 		you're out in the weather it's no fun at all
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">sure</ENAMEX> and my finances have always been a little precarious so sometimes repairing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> is a financial necessity
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		right right
 	
 	
 		um but it's the the down side of that is that i very rarely always had the right tools and
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		i've
 	
 	
 		because yeah you can't afford to buy them so
 	
 	
 		yeah exactly yeah yeah it's a sort of a catch <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty two</TIMEX> if you're well enough off to buy these exotic tools you need to do the work then you can generally have somebody else do it for you
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		right
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh</ENAMEX> so have you found um one certain type of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> needs less repair work than another
 	
 	
 		so
 		well um
 	
 	
 		have you had that many different <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> or
 	
 	
 		it's funny i've i've owned a lot of different <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> i started out with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Volkswagons</ENAMEX> and then um
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">uh</ENAMEX> graduated to um a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Honda</ENAMEX> and had that for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a long time</TIMEX> and then graduated to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Volvo</ENAMEX> and then wound up with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Honda</ENAMEX> again
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		hm
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and so i've i've  had them all and and uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh have gotten to know the engines in each <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of these uh sorts of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicles</ENAMEX> and but uh i in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Volkswagon</ENAMEX> business i i went from you know owning a bug to owning uh one of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> called a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rabbit</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 		oh yes uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and the and there was a completely different kind of engine in the Rabbit um but i i actually rebuilt a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Volkswagon</ENAMEX> bug engine at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> point and uh so i learned an awful lot about <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> uh that way and
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh
 		boy i'll say i'll say well we i don't know we're a little bit partial our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Honda</ENAMEX> we have got <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred and</NUMEX>
