 
     		
 	
 		do you see as uh the changes that have occurred in the last <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> then <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beverly</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i think one of the thing that i notice a lot i know it's touching social changes but uh to me what becomes socially acceptable
 		and i i don't know if it's a factor of me growing older and seeing things through different eyes or if it's a factor of our society actually moving in that direction but i notice things on TV being more um
 		open  more i i believe that they portray things on TV obviously that they never would've <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX> and you know and specifically nudity things like that um
 		i i don't know i i've said several times to my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> that i feel like jeez in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten years</TIMEX> they'll have just full nudity on TV and nobody'll think anything of it
 		and to me that's surprising to me that's that's a big change to accept it and it comes across i think subtly you know little at a time to where you get so used to seeing a little change that
 		you know when they go uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> step further you don't notice it that much so that's one of the biggest ones i've seen
 	
 	
 		huh yeah that's a big one
 	
 	
 		what about you
 	
 	
 		well i think that society has come to a point where they're they're not responsible for any of their actions somebody else uh made them do it uh
 		that's what i seem to see a lot of that uh no one is willing to take responsibility for their life and their choices
 		it's rather sue these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> because they made a faulty uh a seat belt that didn't work right or
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		well that's what i think is a big one but
 	
 	
 		i tend to agree with you and i think there's a lot of that um ah yeah we have become lawsuit happy any little thing it's like let's see what i can get don't you think that maybe a lot of that came from um
 		oh you know the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the the era</TIMEX> we went through that was like you know hey if it makes you happy do it
 		you know kind of like disregard to others do what makes you happy and and yes we should take care of ourselves you know and we should see to our own lives but not to a total disregard of others
 		um
 		i don't know i think it's come to that a lot i see it a lot in my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> i have a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four year old</TIMEX>  and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		hers isn't a social thing as much as it's a stage they go through but whenever something happens it's you made me hit that you made me do this and so i try to tell her Brianna
 		everything isn't always somebody else's fault you know you have to watch where you're going  and and so it's what you just said kind of hits home to me just through her
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		yeah and another thing i think has changed quite a bit is uh
 		the roles that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> play
 		that's really in the last <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty years</TIMEX> has changed significantly
 	
 	
 		i think you're right um in your opinion good or bad or both
 	
 	
 		well both you know there's some great things that uh
 		have come about with more equality
 		but i think that also i don't know what's causing society to have so many broken <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> and things like that because i think that's bad for us
 	
 	
 		i do too  i think part of that
 		i i don't know i think the role of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> changing has been good in that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> are feeling like
 		in in terms of their self confident confidence their self-worth you know i can do something i can be somebody you know if i put my mind to it i can accomplish things too and i think that's good but um
 		i think when you push you know maybe i think when that was first trying come about with you know what we know as the women's lib movement  i think it was too extreme um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i think you can be feminine and still be all those other things too you know and i think there's definite roles and i think you know part of the break up of the family
 		maybe it's because of the the the social changes i don't know the fact that ah
 		during their early changes where you know <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> did come more
 		speak maybe maybe speak out i was gonna say come more out of themselves but speak out i think a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> were threatened by that i think now less <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> are you know because they're used to it it's around them um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but i i don't know i i
 		i don't know why the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> are breaking up i think that may go back to what you said a minute ago about <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> not being responsible for themselves or their actions because it's like
 		they don't go into the marriage with a commitment that this is gonna work they go in and say well hey you know
 		i'll stick with it while it's good and then i'll get out
 		and i i i think that directly affects the effort that you put into that marriage or that commitment
 	
 	
 		yeah i would agree with you ah
 		so
