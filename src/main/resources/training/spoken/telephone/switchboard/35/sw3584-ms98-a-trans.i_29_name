 
     		
 	
 		well tell me about your home
 	
 	
 		
 
 		okay uh right now we're living in uh well it's me uh my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> and uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX>
 		and uh right now we're in a uh i guess it's either a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> lot line or a garden home
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		which you might call it so we don't have a a big yard uh but uh when my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> and i <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> moved in it was just the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of us so it was enough
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> and it's uh i guess what they call a story and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a half</TIMEX> because it's not a full <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> story
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		where you know everything on top is on bottom
 		so it's got real high ceilings on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and the other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> is just standard sized ceilings
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		and uh it's it's about a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five year</TIMEX> old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> now
 	
 	
 		it sounds nice
 	
 	
 		it's uh pretty nice unfortunately unfortunately the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">builder</ENAMEX> who built it went out of business already
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah it was a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Landmark</ENAMEX> is the one who built it
 	
 	
 		yeah well you know these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> that gambled high lost big you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		exactly what happened to them
 	
 	
 		i'm insulating myself from that problem i'm building my own house
 	
 	
 		oh that's nice
 	
 	
 		
  
 		and as i look out the window of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trailer</ENAMEX> i can envision
 		all the insulation that's going up  today
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh really are you doing it yourself
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i i used to be a builder
 	
 	
 		wow
 		oh that's nice
 	
 	
 		and i retired <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about five years ago</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh i see
 	
 	
 		and started college
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and now i'm uh a college educated builder
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		there's still no work you know
 		so uh you know i decided <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this summer</TIMEX> that uh you know we had enough credit on the credit cards to buy the materials so i did
 	
 	
 		that's great
 	
 	
 		and uh see the the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> has a law that says you cannot borrow the money to build your own home
 	
 	
 		really is that so i didn't know that
 	
 	
 		you can borrow the money to pay somebody else to build your <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> but you can't borrow the money to build your own
 	
 	
 		that sounds kind of dumb
 	
 	
 		well it's to protect the
 		the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> that say yeah i want to build my own <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and go out a build a spec home and then it doesn't sell and then the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX>'s holding the bag
 	
 	
 		hm
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		as as you know anything that involves the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> is works <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">half</TIMEX> as well as it's supposed to costs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times as much right hence the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">savings and loan</ENAMEX> problem we have today
 	
 	
 		that's right
 		yeah that's true
 	
 	
 		but uh you know my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> is uh fairly simple it's designed to be added on to
 	
 	
 		um-hum that's good
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well i figure it's just me and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> but you know i like to do stuff with my hands and what not so i'm gonna have a shop
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah how big a lot do you got it on
 	
 	
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> acres
 	
 	
 		wow that's nice that's real nice
 	
 	
 		well yes it's really nice too because i can't see my nearest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX> he's on the other side of a hill
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and my second nearest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX> is a dot on the horizon
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		seriously
 	
 	
 		God that's pretty good
 	
 	
 		and well in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> in the winter time i can see see another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> but you know he's
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know i can just make out his place you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i got a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> mile view to the east and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about ten mile</NUMEX> to the
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">north</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		oh that's pretty good uh
 	
 	
 		yeah well i took a lot of time in choosing this site
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		because the the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX> has no heating or air conditioning
 	
 	
 		oh you you you don't plan on putting any any of that in
 	
 	
 		well it's got a a very small furnace and a uh i'm use a wood burning stove as well but
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> itself i've been working inside you know these low these <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many months</TIMEX> and i have not had to use the heat
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		wow
 	
 	
 		because it's all geothermal
 	
 	
 		yeah that's pretty good
 	
 	
 		and with all the see i've got on the south side is all glass well as much as i could get in it you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh the east side is glass i've got uh <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">one two three four five six</NUMEX> windows in the east side on <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">forty eight feet</NUMEX> so it's almost all glass
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> would love that
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i mean you know
 	
 	
 		she loves lots of windows
 	
 	
 		there's no place in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> where you can stand and not see <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> windows
 	
 	
 		that's great
 	
 	
 		so uh
 	
 	
 		is it a single story
 	
 	
 		well not really it's uh it's on the side of a hill
 	
 	
 		oh i see
 	
 	
 		so the first you know the the the what i call residential level at the side that's in the hill is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about four feet</NUMEX> deep
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		um i see
 	
 	
 		and the side that's on the uh the other side is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about six feet</NUMEX> high
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so i got a pretty good grade there and then when i put the verandas which which will be <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">twelve feet</NUMEX> out all all the way around on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">north south</ENAMEX> and east <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sides</ENAMEX> that will define the shop
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah that's kind of like uh like a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Victorian</ENAMEX> style
 	
 	
 		so
 		exactly yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah i i've always liked that the you know i we don't have much yard but i built a small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">deck</ENAMEX> in the back but you know i i see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">th</ENAMEX> ese <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazines</ENAMEX> where you know do your self your own decks
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i i kind of wish i had them the size property and
 		and uh one with a grade on it so i can build a real nice <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">deck</ENAMEX> when
 	
 	
 		yeah
