 
     		
 	
 		well i guess we're supposed to talk about what's being done about recycling
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yes
 	
 	
 		well lots right
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		finally
 	
 	
 		really what what do you do now
 	
 	
 		well we have saved our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> because the uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boy Scouts</ENAMEX> our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> have been involved in have uh had a huge recycling bin  over at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Resurrection Lutheran Church</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and um
 		so we've done that for quite some time but since the price of paper has gone down like it's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about a fifth</NUMEX> of what it used to be
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		so the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Boy Scout</ENAMEX> troop quit doing it when the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> took it over
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		so now we just put ours out for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plano</ENAMEX> do you live in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Plano</ENAMEX> okay yeah
 	
 	
 		yes i do yeah and i'm so glad when they brought out those recycling bins have you had yours now yeah
 	
 	
 		you
 		right
 		yes although just just <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about a week ago</TIMEX> some of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">volunteer mothers</ENAMEX> that um work in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> for me said they hadn't gotten theirs
 	
 	
 		oh that's why i asked you i guess it you know it does go in cycles and not everyone got theirs right away
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		like
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		and i i was so relieved because i've been making a real concerted effort make you know recycling the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aluminum</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX> and even got into plastic because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wal-Mart</ENAMEX> collected it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		right yeah we used to take ours there
 	
 	
 		and uh my <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garage</ENAMEX> was just getting overwhelmed and of course i didn't go <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekly</TIMEX> so it became quite a big thing and uh
 	
 	
 		i know
 		right right i'm really glad they do it um
 		yeah i do <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX> mostly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">um plastic</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two liter</TIMEX> diet <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Coke</ENAMEX> bottles  and aluminum cans some but i don't use as many of those
 	
 	
 		yes yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i guess the ones that are hard to convince yourself to do are the ones that you have to really that are really dirty that you have to wash out
 	
 	
 		yeah well i found out after washing out many a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peanut butter jar</ENAMEX> that they're not a recycling number one or two
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh ha</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh ha</ENAMEX> so it was wasting a lot of time
 	
 	
 		wasting all your time and effort and putting it in there
 	
 	
 		yeah thinking i was safe in buying those jars as far as the environment was concerned
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh you know but it it's not that hard now that i've got this system under control yeah
 	
 	
 		got your routine down yeah
 		well i guess there are some places um in the north in particular that um have a real definite way of encouraging you to recycle because they charge you
 		let's see they charge you for your garbage pick up by the weight
 	
 	
 		ah uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so if you recycle things of course then you don't have all that weight in there
 	
 	
 		yeah i do find that i don't have as much to throw away because all the bulky things are are being tossed in with the recycling and uh
 	
 	
 		right that's right
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		i don't know what they could do more of exactly around here right now other than uh what are some of the things they don't recycle oh one thing i thought about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the other day</TIMEX> were batteries just everyday regular batteries
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		supposedly you know leak and and contaminate the landfills and yet what am i going to do when i have a couple double A batteries to toss out and they don't take
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah right probably going to throw them in your trash
 	
 	
 		yeah that's what happens because
 	
 	
 		well there are places that take car batteries but i wonder if they would take
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i mean not that it would  kind of a pain to you know drive over somewhere special just for that for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two little</NUMEX> tiny batteries but
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah but i think the city one could possibly look into that or something
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true
 	
 	
 		uh if they've got these bins for all the other little items i'm sure if <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people people</ENAMEX> will have batteries uh you know quite often to to toss out
 	
 	
 		right that's true um
 		when i was home <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">those few days</TIMEX> around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thanksgiving</TIMEX> and the um
 		the truck came by well we all ran out to watch it because you know we'd never  really seen it pick up our stuff and one thing i thought was interesting was that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">driver</ENAMEX> had something on his belt that he uh scanned across the little bar code on our bin
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh
 		oh is that right
 	
 	
 		as soon as he took the stuff and he just pulled this thing kind of out of his pocket and just you know scanned it so i don't know why what that was reading it for
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		but um they must be trying to keep track of you know who is doing it or what i guess i don't know another
 	
 	
 		registering our garbage
 		yeah wouldn't it be nice if you could get a credit back at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the year</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh for those who are really cooperating now that would encourage it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well except i know it would just not be cost effective they've already got all this money out on hired um getting the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trucks</ENAMEX> and hiring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to work them i'm sure they couldn't afford that but um
 	
 	
 		sure sure
 		but the garbage um now there is just one garbage <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> that comes
 	
 	
 		yeah oh yeah
 	
 	
 		on the truck instead of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
 		so that's interesting um also slightly off the subject but our our big green garbage thing got stolen
 	
 	
 		oh it did  goodness
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		and we called we called the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> and um
 		they they brought us a new one and they did not charge us and they said that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between three and four hundred</NUMEX> have been stolen
 	
 	
 		oh my goodness it is sad you know they paid for those things anyway or our taxes do
 	
 	
 		isn't that sad you know it just
 		oh and they must be yeah really expensive i mean of course we were hoping we weren't we weren't going to have to pay for it you know but i mean what would somebody do with them
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		oh how there
