 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay do you do you have a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> or are you in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> okay so do you have to do a lot of garden work
 	
 	
 		uh-huh i have a home
 		not really we have a a small back yard and small front yard but um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um i do basically like the shrubbery and the planting and the weeding and he mows the lawn because the <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">lawn mower</ENAMEX>'s too heavy
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		that's another story  and um
 		and uh i do the edging and stuff like that but um it doesn't take us that long because our our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">yard</ENAMEX>'s so small but um i try and do as much you know flowering as i can and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		that kind of stuff the seasonal things
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but um
 		and well i think we have one of the nicest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">yards</ENAMEX> in the in the neighborhood
 	
 	
 		well that's nice  i wish i could say that
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		ours is pretty small too but it it takes <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about an hour</TIMEX> with the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of us working to you know do the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">bushes</ENAMEX> and and all of that sort of thing um the worst part is controlling the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">weeds</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		which i hate because we don't like to use a lot of the chemicals and because like we have a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> and and you know he's gonna be out in the yard and who knows what he eats out there but we try not to use them but we end up using some anyway
 	
 	
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		uh hum what else
 		i get to put out all the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> lights out there and all that sort of thing
 	
 	
 		i don't  no he does that
 	
 	
 		no
 		oh okay well if if they go up like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one year</TIMEX> we did the edge of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX> all the way up on the roof and i i went up on the roof once and i'll never do it again
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yes
 		oh
 		oh God
 	
 	
 		i decided i was afraid
 	
 	
 		yeah i don't blame
 	
 	
 		so <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> he got lazy so i said fine i'll put some on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">bushes</ENAMEX> and that's about it that's all it it gets
 	
 	
 		yeah huh
 	
 	
 		but
 	
 	
 		okay we don't have that many <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">bushes</ENAMEX> to put them on um our our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">yards</ENAMEX> are very uh narrow and so we have some bushes but we don't have too many but we have a nice <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> in the front and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh we have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> that comes and mows everybody's front yard and um they keep hitting hitting it the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> with the lawn mower you know every time you do that you
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 		oh no
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it it um kind of
 		kills the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> for a while and so that's kind of stunt its growth for just a while until we get it back going again
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and we started mowing our own lawn because they were doing that and so anyways we have a nice full <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> now and and we put our we usually fill it with lights and that kind of thing
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so
 		and they would um they also edged and they would edge into into the shrubbery and oh gosh it was getting really bad so we
 	
 	
 		hum
 		oh
 		but you still have to pay for it though even though they're not gonna do it
 	
 	
 		yeah because it's an association fee
 	
 	
 		oh is it real expensive
 	
 	
 		yes it's like seventy a month
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 		oh my goodness
 	
 	
 		yeah and it i don't like i i just get really upset every time i make that check out but um
 	
 	
 		yeah well do do they do other things for y'all
 	
 	
 		they take care of the um landscape because we live in a cul-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">de</ENAMEX>-sac and there's a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> in the middle and so they care of that and there's a pool and they take care of the pool and and there's a pond they take care of the pond and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">park</ENAMEX> area and that kind of thing and so you're
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		basically paying oh and the sprinkler system that that our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">yard</ENAMEX> doesn't have a sprinkler system but the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">island</ENAMEX> does and um certain sharing areas have sprinkler systems and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and so that way if someone moves out the entire neighborhood is mowed and watered and that kind of thing you know so
 	
 	
 		hm but you knew when you moved in you'd have to pay that didn't you
 	
 	
 		well it it it went up since we pay and that's the bad thing i just hope it doesn't go up any more because we just can't afford it anymore i don't know what to do if you can't afford it
 	
 	
 		oh
 		yeah
 		i don't know either that's interesting
 	
 	
 		so um but they're that's what they do they take care of basically the front <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">yards</ENAMEX> and unless you don't want them to do it and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		now do they do things like plant <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">bushes</ENAMEX> and trees
 	
 	
 		they only only in like in the common areas and then the island but they don't do it in your yard
 	
 	
 		oh okay so there's like no restriction on what types of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">bushes</ENAMEX> you can have or anything like that
 	
 	
 		right uh-huh yeah so we've added <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">bushes</ENAMEX> and and shrubbery too
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah when we moved into our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> i just hated the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">bushes</ENAMEX> they had and i i ripped most of them out and put them somewhere in the back and put new ones out front but that was a lot of work took me a long time
 	
 	
 		i know
 		yeah
 		yeah  that's what we did when we first moved in too just rearranged some things
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah and then then we put in a sprinkler system and we won't go through that again i will pay someone to do it oh it took so long
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh really
 		oh
 	
 	
 		because my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> was you know digging the trenches because he didn't want to get a trencher you know there the machine that'll do it because he knew so many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that broke it through their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> main or their gas main doing it
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and i guess that costs you an absolute fortune
 	
 	
 		oh
 		that's true so gosh you did it manually huh oh yeah oh God
 	
 	
 		by hand yeah yeah
 		but it works great now that we've got it yeah it's nice
 	
 	
 		i bet yeah that's a good investment there
 	
 	
 		yeah well we needed to because we're having some foundation trouble and you know you have to keep the the area moist around the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> or it makes it worse so we had an incentive there
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		to do that
