 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay go ahead
 	
 	
 		all right
 		well what kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> would i wanna buy i don't know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		the question is i mean would i want to buy or would i would i probably actually buy may be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different things
 	
 	
 		oh well if you if you had all your all the money in the world or something i don't
 	
 	
 		if i had all the money i wanted then that's whole different matter yeah uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		no the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> in in that case i'd i'd i don't know
 		i i my dream <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> was a was a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Porsche Turbo</ENAMEX> Carrera
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but uh i don't know if i'd want one of those now well i of course i would want <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> if somebody was was giving it to me but i maybe would buy a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMW</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		well
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um
 		or or even a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Volvo</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		what do you have now
 	
 	
 		i've got a a uh a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dodge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Daytona</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um-hum  hm
 	
 	
 		it's actually the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> car we ever bought new and everything
 	
 	
 		oh really yeah we just we well i have my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> one we ever bought new too but we just bought another used <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple weeks ago</TIMEX> actually
 	
 	
 		uh-huh what
 		uh-huh me yeah me too  so so what <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> do you drive what is it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um mine is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Honda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Accord</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh we almost bought one of those do you like it
 	
 	
 		yeah i do and and um it's funny because after i bought it i was doing a lot of business traveling and i some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> that i got were like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toyota</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Camry</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nissan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Maxima</ENAMEX> and some of the competitors
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and um i didn't like them as well except it wasn't really fair comparison because those were automatics and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mine</ENAMEX> is a standard and the reason i got a standard was because i thought it handled a lot better it had a lot more pickup and everything
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah yeah you get a little more control over when it when it's doing the things it's doing yeah um  so what what rental <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> did you go to to actually rent to to rent those kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		um usually <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avis</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		to what <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avis</ENAMEX> really
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avis</ENAMEX> yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		huh i guess
 	
 	
 		well it's just because we're on uh i think of it i'm not sure if those are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avis</ENAMEX> or not but we have corporate contracts
 	
 	
 		i see
 	
 	
 		you know with the various <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> so it depends on your destination too it's kind of strange
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		right
 		you work for a big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> then
 	
 	
 		work for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI um</ENAMEX>-hum which is how i heard about this
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> i
 		uh-huh um but  yeah i i uh
 		i don't know i i would probably if i were to buy a car myself you know and with the constraints of the real of the of real money i probably would would
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		go with something like you you know like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Honda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Accord</ENAMEX> maybe it would it one thing i i really liked about about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dodge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Daytona</ENAMEX> is the fact that they have uh um  this <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven year</TIMEX> warranty
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">um</ENAMEX> and it really saved us some big money once
 	
 	
 		it did wow
 	
 	
 		yeah they had a whole bunch of things that that sort of broke at the same time
 	
 	
 		oh my gosh
 	
 	
 		and uh the bill would've been over fifteen <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">hundred dollars</NUMEX> and i had to pay <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty five</TIMEX> for the
 	
 	
 		oh that is great that's unusual to hear usually you know if something breaks you look at the warranty and it's excluded
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well the well we we bought the extended the the extension
 	
 	
 		oh i see okay
 	
 	
 		and uh at the time we bought it it was like you know it was i don't know <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four hundred and twenty five</NUMEX> dollars or something extra
 	
 	
 		oh well you got your money's worth
 	
 	
 		yeah we did but you know we really debated at the beginning and of of course i'm glad i did it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah that is good
 	
 	
 		but um we still have we still have like you know couple <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three years</TIMEX> left on it
 	
 	
 		yeah well i've been lucky <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mine</ENAMEX> hasn't had any trouble except <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX> a shopping cart crashed into it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh no
 	
 	
 		but i was real lucky because it just hit the um the lens to the light it didn't actually dent the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> or anything so it cost me <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty five</TIMEX> bucks to replace that
 	
 	
 		bumper
 		oh
 		well that's good are
 	
 	
 		and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX> will pay for it anyway so
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		no big deal
 	
 	
 		um if you were if you were going to uh buy a new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> would you buy another uh another <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Accord</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um i probably wouldn't just because we already have one
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but you know if i had to make the choice again i yeah i'd i'm perfectly happy with what i decided um although we did just buy another car and that's a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Legend</ENAMEX> um but it's it's a used one
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh yeah those are nice and
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and um my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> has really wanted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a long time</TIMEX> and the fact that you know this car this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> that i have has performed so well and before that i also had an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Accord</ENAMEX> it was a real old one
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and um i bought that used i had absolutely no money to my name and bought that and it served me real well too so he's been impressed with all the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Honda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		hm
 		right
 	
 	
 		and
 	
 	
 		yeah my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> drives one she drives a uh um i don't know is it <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Legend</ENAMEX> it's uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh i'm not certain though  but she's liked it um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but i i have i have never had and we  in fact what i'm driving right now we bought a
 		we only had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a long time</TIMEX> and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and yet most of our usage of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> was just this little shuttle back and forth you know from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">four miles</NUMEX> to work and back kind of thing
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and so uh i bought a used Yugo just to be a little you know a little <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> that i could care less about just waste yeah
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>

 		oh well it's uh it's worked you know it i mean it's exactly what it is you know it's just a it's a cheap lit tle you know little <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> just to go you know running run around <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> in and uh
 	
 	
 		hasn't left you stranded
 		yeah i know
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's actually kind of fun to drive i i i you know getting back in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Daytona</ENAMEX> now i almost don't like it you know it's just like too too mushy and it you know it's it's an automatic and the
