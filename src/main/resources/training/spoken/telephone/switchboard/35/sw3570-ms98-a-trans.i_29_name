 
     		
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">okay Howard</ENAMEX> what do you think of our space budget and should we go ahead and
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		and keep exploring or should we call a halt to it is it doing any good
 	
 	
 		i think that the space program has done a lot of good for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> now i think what we made a major
 		wrong turn we went into the uh
 		to the current generation of space <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">craft</ENAMEX> the reusable ones like they are now
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		because they have not proven as reliable as they should have and i think some of the earlier approaches were much more um much better in many ways
 		however um you know we've gained an awful lot from the space program all the way from remote monitoring to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Teflon</ENAMEX> to uh
 		some new space age <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">materials plastics</ENAMEX> and all that so i think it's been a good investment
 		uh somebody was telling me the return
 		was about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty five or thirty</TIMEX> dollars for every dollar spent
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		which is amazing for any governmental financed program   i wish the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">post office</ENAMEX> just stop raising our rates um
 	
 	
 		oh yes wish our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">post office</ENAMEX> could do that
 		that's right i wish they'd just deliver stuff
 	
 	
 		i think though that now that we're finally starting to get over the fears and the uh
 		oh i don't know the guilt that we had out of uh <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Challenger i</ENAMEX> think maybe we can pick up and go on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">now</TIMEX> but
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i i don't know i don't think we're really have all of our act together yet as far as clear objectives
 	
 	
 		i agree
 	
 	
 		the space <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX> is where we should go
 	
 	
 		i agree seems like that we've kind of gotten side tracked with
 	
 	
 		at this point
 	
 	
 		putting all these different things up there to monitor and  you know and i'm in favor of you know getting closer to seeing certain things but i'd like to see them also go you know go back up there see you know what they can do see about setting a a space <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX> up
 		i'm all in favor of the space program and i don't think we should stop and i don't think we should cut the money
 	
 	
 		well where do you think we ought to go with it
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		you talking about uh uh a a fully manned space <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX> that we'll keep up there
 	
 	
 		yeah i would like i'd like to see that i'd like for us to really find out more about the actual universe and get up there and and see what's going on even if you know there's no life up there or anything you know but who knows and i would like to see them do something like that
 	
 	
 		well you
 	
 	
 		i i hate to see them just you know keep getting diverted off to spying on other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nations</ENAMEX> and putting up defense things and
 		i think they i think they lose sight of of part of what they're supposed to be doing
 	
 	
 		well i think about half the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">missions</ENAMEX> now are are military related are they not
 	
 	
 		yes yes
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		i believe they are
 	
 	
 		it seems like it's that high a percentage
 	
 	
 		you know let's go back to our original thing with you know the right experiments and our uh
 		you know our actual exploring of space and and all that and you know with with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Russia</ENAMEX>
 		uh seemingly not going to be as as big a threat
 	
 	
 		well they can't afford to
 	
 	
 		huh-uh you know and have you gone out to uh <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fort Worth</ENAMEX> to see the space <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> space exhibit
 	
 	
 		no we were talking about that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this weekend</TIMEX> we it's only going to be there <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple more weeks</TIMEX> we need to go
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum we went uh we took our grandsons and went uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekend</TIMEX> before last and it is marvelous i mean it's really neat how they they have done it they have done a beautiful job
 	
 	
 		have they
 	
 	
 		and they have a uh scaled down model showing how they you know fuel it or you know how they uh
 		oh the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">fuel</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trucks</ENAMEX> and things run out there to it and how they uh all those things that are against the actual space mission uh space ship
 		you know how they fall away from it and the loading and then and then it's actually you know the smoke comes out like it's taking off it is really interesting
 	
 	
 		oh yes
 		well maybe i need to run out there <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this weekend</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		you really do it it's well worth the time and effort we went uh early on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> we got out there about uh
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten ten thirty</TIMEX> and beat
 	
 	
 		now do you have to have tickets ahead excuse me
 	
 	
 		no we bought tickets there and if you have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> if you go to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McDonald's</ENAMEX> you could they have coupons or did have now they may be through with them now that uh buy <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> gets in free
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um i think both of both of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> are too old for that
 	
 	
 		oh okay oh okay you have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teenagers</ENAMEX> or something yes well i had <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandchildren</ENAMEX> so <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of them so between their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandfather</ENAMEX> and i because their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> was at work and uh
 	
 	
 		they're both uh
 		yes yes
 		but you
 	
 	
 		but and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> loved it you know they really did like it
 	
 	
 		it's it's very impressive i'm sure
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh-huh</ENAMEX> it is and i felt the uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six year old</TIMEX> would you know that he'd be kind of bored but he wasn't even the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three year old</TIMEX> enjoyed it
 		because they had one of those had one of those moon vehicles
 	
 	
 		what
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and had it set up like it was on the moon and and showed it moving around and stuff so it was really neat
 	
 	
 		well see now that's something else the uh <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russians</ENAMEX> have had space <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stations manned stations space stations</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> now you you know they had the MIRV
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and see we've yet to keep anyone up over  <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">over a week or ten days</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		right
 		well in going through it i got the impression that actually they were farther ahead
