 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well let's see my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> does the majority of the um the uh gardening um taking care of the lawn and fertilizing but i um tend to all the
 		planting the annuals and and the spraying and um taking care of them and maybe putting <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> in you know throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that season</TIMEX> and
 		later on maybe planting some mums and that kind of stuff and um  any kind of decorating for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the holidays</TIMEX> you know i'll fix the porch up with pumpkins for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Halloween</TIMEX> and
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> but basically he does all the heavy stuff and i do all the fun stuff
 	
 	
 		well we have it just opposite here
 		my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> works in you know at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">at</TIMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TI</ENAMEX> and she's uh sedentary <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all day</TIMEX> long
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so when she gets <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> she likes to mow
 	
 	
 		i say
 	
 	
 		and we have <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about ten acres</NUMEX> and she tries to mow <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about half</NUMEX> of it
 	
 	
 		wow
 		wow that's a a big job
 	
 	
 		well yeah it keeps uh well it's doing real well because when we got this place the the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dirt</ENAMEX> was just overgrazed
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i mean you know it was bare dirt in a lot of places
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and now you know since we've been mowing it and you know of course we water a little bit
 		but that's just too much to water all at once but
 	
 	
 		oh sure
 	
 	
 		but just by keeping it mowed and getting it mulched in we've reclaimed a lot of it
 	
 	
 		oh i bet it's beautiful
 	
 	
 		yeah but we don't do much in the way of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">uh flowers</ENAMEX> we have one little flower garden that we that we work with the rest of it is just like wild <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		wild flowers
 	
 	
 		and in the summertime we get the prettiest yellow <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		they're about oh i guess <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a third</NUMEX> the size of your palm of your hand
 	
 	
 		um-hum oh that sounds lovely
 	
 	
 		and
 		of course in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the spring</TIMEX> we get the bluebonnets and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> paintbrush
 	
 	
 		uh-huh oh the wild <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> are beautiful i think um i was thinking about throwing some for in the back just where the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> um just way in the back behind the swing sets so that
 		just have some wild <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> growing back there would be real pretty then you don't really have to have much maintenance involved
 	
 	
 		yeah well my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> and i really enjoy that sort of thing
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh she enjoys mowing i can't believe it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh i know a lot of uh-huh a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> do uh um i've just never really you know maybe one of these days i'll have to get out there and mow but
 	
 	
 		i mean i hate it
 	
 	
 		my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> takes  that and i'll help rake up the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">grass</ENAMEX> and um sometimes i'll help him edge um because we don't have that much property but we're on a corner lot so there's a lot of edging to do and um
 	
 	
 		right yeah
 	
 	
 		uh that's what's nice about living more in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> you don't have to worry about any of that
 	
 	
 		we don't even have any concrete or asphalt
 	
 	
 		oh oh that's nice i this is different for us because the other
 		the past we've had <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> that haven't had any side walks and um it's been a little more <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> and we do miss that um if we had a chance to move i think we'd move back to somewhere that it
 		was little more countrified and a little less maintenance required
 	
 	
 		yeah but you know we do everything together this <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this spring</TIMEX> we got <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a thousand</NUMEX> pine <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> from the actually this fall what am i talking about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks ago</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		as as far as that goes
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		wow
 	
 	
 		we got <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a thousand</NUMEX> pine <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> from the you know soil and conservation people
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh we're in the process of of planting
 	
 	
 		wow that's a
 	
 	
 		and we're building a stand uh just to the north
 		and along the east uh property line
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		and i uh i think what we're what we're trying to do is create sort of a wind break
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		because i'll tell you in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> time when that wind when that wind comes out of the north
 		it just cuts right through you like you're not even there
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		so
 		on the other side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> though that's where we have all the the delicate <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> and the mums and we have <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> glory and we have trumpet <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">vine</ENAMEX> and moon <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		well i took
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and we planted those out by the septic so that uh they get plenty of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> and we get hummingbirds come in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the spring</TIMEX> you know all summer long
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh
 		oh that sounds so pretty
 	
 	
 		and well when we leave the doors open they fly in the house
 	
 	
 		oh really do they don't do any damage though they just fly right back out if you have the
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well yeah they don't like it in here because there's nothing to eat
 	
 	
 		i say
 	
 	
 		and when you're as busy as one of those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">babies</ENAMEX> you got to eat most of the time
 	
 	
 		i say
 	
 	
 		and we've got a few you know we put up some hummingbird feeders and some bird feeders but
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know for the most part gardening for us is well we got <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">asparagus</ENAMEX> and uh we've got some plum <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> and some apple <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>
 		and some tomato

 		oh i love home grown grown <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tomatoes</ENAMEX> there's nothing like them they just don't have the same ones in the supermarket
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well these are accidental <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tomatoes</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		what does that mean accidental <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tomatoes</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		well <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX> came and ate a few of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tomatoes</ENAMEX> course you're gonna lose some that way
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
