 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
  
 		so <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Utah</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		that that's that's the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> that got was famous when they executed somebody <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gary Gilmore</ENAMEX> by firing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">squad</ENAMEX> as i recall
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gary Gilmore</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 		that's right and we still have a death penalty
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		some a gentleman uh
 		that was one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hi-fi murderers</ENAMEX> just had his conviction overturned
 		well appealed again i guess we have the longest uh running <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inmates</ENAMEX> for death row too
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and then we had another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald Lafferty</ENAMEX> that thought God told him to kill his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister-in-law</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		he just got a a new
 		trial because the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> felt that he was incompetent
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh how do you feel about the death penalty
 	
 	
 		well i
 		you you know until recently i've been sort of could go either way you know it it sort of doesn't much you know didn't
 		it wasn't a strong issue
 		um i guess it still isn't a strong issue but i must say i find it very silly the way <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX> are running around creating more and more capital crimes
 		um
 		instead of dealing with real you know the real problems they're you know they're they're they're getting votes presumably by
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		um i assume they're doing it for that reason
 	
 	
 		well i'm sure sure that's their
 	
 	
 		by by by saying well this doing this this particular crime in this particular way is a capital crime now
 	
 	
 		well i kind of agree agree with terrorism i think those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> should be done away with that's
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the worst crimes in my book and uh drug dealing hm
 		that's close but uh terrorism definitely and uh selling out your country
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		it it's not it's not enough just to lock them up forever
 	
 	
 		uh
 		no it's got to be something that is gonna cost them because we never lock anybody up forever
 	
 	
 		um not often
 	
 	
 		not very often at all
 		we've got these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> that uh i'm sure you
 		heard about the ones that killed ah the gentleman that came from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Utah</ENAMEX> to watch the tennis people
 	
 	
 		yep yep
 	
 	
 		and i guess they got convicted the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> of
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh uh murder
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		so you've come to a definite opinion on it now
 	
 	
 		well i i've uh it it it it seems like it's gone gotten carried away um and i i do find it hard to draw know where to draw a line
 		and so if i had to draw a line i'd say just no capital punishment i mean i don't i don't see i don't see that it accomplishes a whole lot
 		whereas i do think that
 		convicting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and and incarcerating them for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a long time</TIMEX> if that could be improved upon that would have more impact i think
 	
 	
 		yeah you kind of hate to
 	
 	
 		no what what about the argument where where somebody who is committing  <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> capital crime chooses to commit a a more serious capital crime i mean murder
 		um because that one at least you might escape from because his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victim</ENAMEX> you know his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witnesses</ENAMEX> will be gone
 		doesn't this doesn't this encourage
 	
 	
 		you mean uh violence
 	
 	
 		uh more serious doesn't doesn't this encourage you know i mean doesn't this encourage murder in order to wipe out the
 	
 	
 		the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witnesses</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witnesses</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		well maybe it would uh
 		i kind of have a problem with our legal system at the moment uh as it is i think that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who
 		uh infringe on other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>'s rights uh and screw up their whole lives with rape uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> molesting uh
 		terrorism just a there's just like <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> things that i think they ought to be snuffed for but i'm i'm for it for certain reasons
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i think that things like rape uh you can't get over uh takes a lifetime
 	
 	
 		i see so so if if <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Kennedy Smith</ENAMEX> had been found guilty you believe he should have been uh executed
 	
 	
 		um if it was
 	
 	
 		a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> jury could've decided either way of course
 	
 	
 		yeah if it was
 		it'd probably have to be a pattern
 		you know we have plenty of convicted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> that go into <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">jail</ENAMEX> and come back out do the same thing and go back and
 		uh if they're habitual like <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times caught for rape or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> molesting then snuff them
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		well but there the problems that they just been let out of jail
 	
 	
 		good
 		pardon
 	
 	
 		the problem there is that they've been let out jail if they've been thrice convicted they should have been kept in longer
 	
 	
 		yeah but we don't seem to keep them long enough
 		and then they learn such bad things in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">jail</ENAMEX> that isn't a place of rehabilitation
 	
 	
 		yeah well
 		yeah that's that's for sure
 	
 	
 		yeah it's a tough question isn't it
 		on whether at what point do they become so detrimental to society that society can't afford to keep them around to keep giving them chances
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hm</ENAMEX>  let's see so the other questions that they wanted was
 		whether the place that we live in
 		uh compares to how we feel what's the laws there in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DC</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i actually don't
