 
     		
 	
 		
 
 		um do you have any elderly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandparents</ENAMEX> that have ever had to go in a nursing home
 	
 	
 		uh yes my uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> was in a nursing home for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five years</TIMEX> before she passed away in nineteen seventy seven
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh now was it how did you feel about that was it a good nursing home and you felt good about her being there or
 	
 	
 		it was a fair nursing home
 	
 	
 		a fair one
 	
 	
 		uh
 		it it was a matter uh she reached the point where she couldn't stay by herself during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the daytime</TIMEX> she and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> who never married lived together
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> couldn't retire at the time so my uh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX> recommended that uh she go into a nursing home
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and fortunately my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> was able to go visit her twice a day
 	
 	
 		oh wow that is good
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		boy i'll say that is good
 	
 	
 		she she just reached the point where she had to have professional care she was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eighty two</NUMEX> at the time
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		my word so she couldn't take care of herself at all
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		did how did she feel about it did she how did your <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> feel about it
 	
 	
 		well
 		i don't think she ever really adjusted
 	
 	
 		didn't she
 	
 	
 		uh my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> was very very shy she never joined anything
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and uh she realized that it was something that had to be done
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but she had begun to lose a great deal of of her memory capacity at the time
 	
 	
 		oh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and finally about uh
 		oh say <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about a year</TIMEX> before she died my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> was the only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> that she ever really recognized and could call by name
 	
 	
 		my word
 		oh oh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> now what about the expense part of it was it an expensive one or did her did she have health insurance or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicaid</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh no uh
 		oh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several years</TIMEX> before well it's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a long thirty</TIMEX> minute story but uh when my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> died in nineteen fifty <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> uh i uh transferred the title to my sister
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		oh
 	
 	
 		uh which was an internal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> deal i i knew that if something happened and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> couldn't take care of her i would
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but uh uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		we had fixed it for her uh
 		oh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many years</TIMEX> before she went into the nursing home like about fifteen so that she had no assets so as it turned out <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicaid</ENAMEX> paid for all of it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		oh
 		oh
 		oh great
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		well that helps because i know that it can take a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>'s whole life life savings i
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> are not quite that old yet but my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandmother um</ENAMEX> right now is in this situation where she cannot stay alone at home either and so
 		um her she has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughters</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughters</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rotate</ENAMEX> and keep her for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three months</TIMEX> at a time and they are all in a position where they can do that right now and then my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">grandmother</ENAMEX> about oh probably <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years ago</TIMEX> she fell and broke her hip
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and of course she had to go into the nursing home there and and it was a fairly nice one in fact she got to where she enjoyed it there she knew the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> and knew the other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that were there and and in fact when she came home
 		she was able to get better and come home she really missed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> there
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and i but i don't know i i whenever i go into a nursing home i
 		uh for some reason it it makes me feel sad i because i a lot of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> i know are there just because
 		um you know their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> want them there and and they don't
 		they aren't willing to take care of them and i i think that's a sad situation
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		my my uh other sister
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh who was married at the time and was still working
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		worked for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several years</TIMEX> in a nursing home and she said <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">roughly half</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> don't have anybody
 	
 	
 		oh no
 	
 	
 		and nobody ever comes to see them
 	
 	
 		my word that many of them
 	
 	
 		yeah that's too bad
 	
 	
 		oh boy i it is i i don't know a nursing home seems to be such a
 		a non personal environment the ones that i've been to um i have been to one that seemed really you know warm and cozy but for the most part they've seemed you know no carpet on the floors and
 		just kind of cold and  i i
 	
 	
 		yeah i know and they all seem understaffed and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>'s overworked
 	
 	
 		right that's right yeah so
 	
 	
 		well let's face it there there for the most part well
 		there's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> exception that i'll tell you about in a minute uh for the most part they're profit centers
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		uh but uh my my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> who looked after my mother
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		uh
 		let's see
 		she died in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ninety</NUMEX> so this would have been the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">nineteen eighty nine</TIMEX> she made
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
