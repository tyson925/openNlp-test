 
     		
 	
 		you go ahead and start or i will whichever you prefer
 	
 	
 		
 
 		okay um well i the thing i like to do the most is swim
 		and i was doing that real regularly but i am expecting right now
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and sick and uh so i have kind of slowed down a little bit
 		but anyway that's the thing that i've found works the best for me is is just doing lap swimming
 	
 	
 		well me i play i love playing <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">basketball</ENAMEX> and volleyball
 	
 	
 		oh do you
 	
 	
 		i do and i play well i played a lot
 		until i hurt my shoulders <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this summer</TIMEX> playing volleyball and
 		they haven't come back to full swing yet so i haven't been able to play as much as i would have liked to but
 	
 	
 		oh did you play in high school
 	
 	
 		no in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> they don't have um they don't have volleyball i played basketball but not on the school team
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		just played a lot recreational i didn't have i worked so so i didn't really have time but
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		it's i love actually athletics is really for me it's a great thing to do i do it one to keep in shape and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> just to to not stress it's my release of tension
 	
 	
 		oh well i know my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> likes to do that he plays racquetball too yeah uh-huh he still does some
 	
 	
 		oh does he
 	
 	
 		he's he's played it since i guess he was in college and then um he plays uh <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two or three</NUMEX> times a week so he's a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Sports Mall</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Salt Lake</ENAMEX> and he'll go on his <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">noon hour and</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		he still likes to do that so that i know that that's one thing that he likes to do and i think that relieves stress too
 	
 	
 		that's awesome
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		do you <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> mostly just exercise to release <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX> or to relax or
 	
 	
 		oh well i think i do it for uh weight reasons i mean you know to
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so you don't gain weight but
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		and also i i know i feel a lot better when i do
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but i like i said i have just been really sick and and just can't i'm just almost too tired i i was going um in the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">mornings</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and that
 	
 	
 		well i tell you having a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX> is rough isn't it
 	
 	
 		what
 	
 	
 		from what i hear having a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX> is rough
 	
 	
 		well yeah we we have also have an <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eleven</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">month old</TIMEX> and a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six year old</TIMEX> and and so it's just kind of
 	
 	
 		oh my
 		
 
 	
 	
 		um it's finding the time for me to exercise is another thing but i really do like to do it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but
 	
 	
 		well great
 	
 	
 		anyway
 	
 	
 		you're a brave <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> to do all that
 	
 	
 		oh jeez well the the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX> kind of keep me exercising too
 	
 	
 		that's true there
 	
 	
 		just chasing after them i guess yeah so you do you have much time to do that since you're in college now
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um i make time really if i if i don't make time my study habits or actually i don't my studying doesn't go as well i can't concentrate and so
 	
 	
 		and so it just kind of helps to work it in there huh
 	
 	
 		yeah and really it's if i don't if i do it i i feel like i get a lot more accomplished in a day than if i don't
 	
 	
 		huh well
 	
 	
 		and so it's it's for me it just is worthwhile to find time to even if for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">half an hour</TIMEX> just to get out and run
 	
 	
 		yeah i think that's probably true with anything when you work some exercise in it just seems like things seem to go more smoothly i don't know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that should be a part of i guess everybody's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> things
 	
 	
 		i tend to agree i think it makes it a lot better for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> as well as as for a couple if you're married or if you're anything like that it just helps to i don't know to have something to do
 	
 	
 		oh i know my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> wants me to take up golf that's another thing he does and uh you know i don't know that i see that as a real big exercise though
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i don't know i've i've been a few times but that's something i am really bad  i mean you know
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it takes me <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a million</NUMEX> strokes to get it in so
 	
 	
 		that's right that's me too and i'm supposed to be good at it so
 	
 	
 		oh  so you do golf huh
