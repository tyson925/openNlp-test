 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay go ahead what are you gonna fix for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> dinner
 	
 	
 		you know i  i think the simpler the better
 	
 	
 		i think so too yes
 	
 	
 		too often we spend all day
 		cooking and uh it's like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Erma  Bombeck</ENAMEX>'s cartoon said it
 		
 
 		you spend <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">eighteen hours</TIMEX> fixing your dinner and it takes <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twelve minutes</TIMEX> to eat it
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		less than twelve minutes
 	
 	
 		well we're gonna fix a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">turkey</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ham</ENAMEX> we're gonna have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about fifteen</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> for dinner and we're gonna have all the fixings with that the dressing and also you know everything with the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ham</ENAMEX> so
 		we're gonna have a real nice dinner
 	
 	
 		well the i think that sounds like fun
 	
 	
 		the thing that i think that's missing at the uh  little <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> parties though is uh
 		fruits you fix you put out grapes <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> eat those up <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> and
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		you put out <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">strawberries</ENAMEX> they grab for those first
 	
 	
 		right and we kind of get uh overdosed on the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sweets</ENAMEX> don't we
 	
 	
 		i think it
 		right i think that's what the problem may maybe that's i think that way because i can't have those <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sweets</ENAMEX>  so
 	
 	
 		well they usually don't do a whole lot good for us and uh
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh i'm been trying to think of something uh nifty to make for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX>
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> i used to just bake cakes and there's there you go more sweet stuff
 	
 	
 		yes
 		uh right
 		i thought <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> kind of get so overloaded and most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are trying to lose weight anyway
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		so it's kind of hard to get away from that isn't it
 		hard to kind of deviate a little bit uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so have you got any good recipes that don't have uh
 	
 	
 		well i i do but they're at home i don't have i'm at work <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">right now</TIMEX> and i don't have them with me
 	
 	
 		yes that's true that's right
 	
 	
 		i have some sugarless recipes
 	
 	
 		that's right
 		are you diabetic or
 	
 	
 		no i'm hypoglycemic
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		so i have um recipes to make <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cookies</ENAMEX> without <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sugar</ENAMEX> we put uh fresh
 		applesauce you know fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX> in it applesauce and
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">raisins</ENAMEX> and things like that in it
 	
 	
 		no you probably  that's the kind of direction you wanna go with food anyway
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		and uh nowadays food it's uh almost everybody eats out of these boxes don't they  the TV dinners or the
 	
 	
 		they what
 	
 	
 		i think food it's really changing to  not spending so much time everybody's such in a hurry
 	
 	
 		uh you
 		yeah they don't wanna spend time cooking and baking and
 	
 	
 		well and i don't think they have the time as much maybe
 	
 	
 		well when you buy those prepared <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX> like that they're all they either have too much <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salt</ENAMEX> in it in them or too much <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sugar</ENAMEX> in them
 	
 	
 		oh yes
 		i'm uh i just haven't you know acquired a taste for them have you
 	
 	
 		no because they're too salty most of those
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		dinners like that
 	
 	
 		most of them are
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		in fact <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">turkey uh</ENAMEX> would be my choice of meal anytime i
 		i'm a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">turkey</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lover</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		oh yes
 	
 	
 		i could eat turkey
 	
 	
 		mine too
 	
 	
 		unfortunately it's not the easiest uh or it takes a while to prepare it
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		but uh it's not necessarily hard it just you got to plan on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">six hours</TIMEX> to cook the thing so
 	
 	
 		well that's why <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> usually have them on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">holidays</TIMEX> because you're usually home visiting and
 	
 	
 		you're home and you've got the time to cook them
 	
 	
 		and it doesn't it smell good in the oven out as it's cooking
 		i said doesn't it smell good
 	
 	
 		yeah in the it just sets the
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">baking</ENAMEX> in the oven
 	
 	
 		the mood i don't know what uh <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thanksgiving</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> would be without
 		especially <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thanksgiving</TIMEX> without the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">turkey</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		wouldn't quite taste right would it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">huh-uh</ENAMEX>
 		it wouldn't be <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thanksgiving</TIMEX> dinner without the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">turkey</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		well even going out to eat we had discussed going out to eat
 		and uh
 		i don't even care at your best <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX> it's just not
 		the same on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a holiday</TIMEX> to
 	
 	
 		yeah when i go out to eat on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thanksgiving</TIMEX> i still have a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">turkey</ENAMEX> dinner
 	
 	
 		yes yes
 		you'd still have to choose that wouldn't you
 	
 	
 		uh-huh i've gone out  on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thanksgiving</TIMEX> like that and had other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> and then i'd leave and i'd say well that doesn't it doesn't seem like it's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thanksgiving</TIMEX> to me
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		it seems like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">another day</TIMEX> it's because you didn't we didn't have any <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">turkey</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you right right
 		you kind of get used to that um well i think i hope that the trend is to change to more health conscious <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">foods</ENAMEX> and not have so many  <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">additives</ENAMEX> and uh preservatives and
 		you know you it's hard to even to get a cold <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cereal</ENAMEX> that you don't feel like it's sugar
 	
 	
 		that's right
 		that's right well
 		and uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> just don't have time to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cook</ENAMEX> anymore like they used to because most of them work
 	
 	
 		no well
 		and i don't mind cooking it's just that you know after you think of the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> it takes you if you get very elaborate sometimes it doesn't seem very rewarding to
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cook</ENAMEX> that <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">many hours</TIMEX> and then you usually have a  a mess
