 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well i need to find out from you how the last
 		remodeling project you undertook and if it was successful and you you were pleased with what happened
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		you've been doing any remodeling lately
 	
 	
 		the only remodeling we do is we put uh new uh we put up molding and wallpaper and we put it up in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chad</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> and in the uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		front room
 	
 	
 		all right did you like the results
 	
 	
 		but i let the
 		yeah i don't do the actual uh
 		uh putting it i don't actually cut them the molding i mean we have a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> come in and do that and we do the painting and the sanding and then i built some shelves in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">basement</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX> so i i guess that qualifies
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		all right
 		yes it does what kind of molding is this uh molding
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">crown</ENAMEX> molding and then some uh chair molding but uh
 	
 	
 		oh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		well that's a lot of fun we
 	
 	
 		i guess maybe we will have to do some new projects when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">baby</ENAMEX> comes
 	
 	
 		oh yeah decorate a nursery or something huh
 	
 	
 		yeah well you know we got the TV in this room
 		that's probably have to be converted to a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bedroom</ENAMEX> so
 	
 	
 		oh okay yes get some uh get an extra <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> there for the new baby
 	
 	
 		well you you haven't had to do any of that have you
 	
 	
 		what's that
 	
 	
 		any remodeling really
 	
 	
 		no uh we've done uh some painting and put up some wallpaper in uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX>' room
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		we needed to to paint because the paint was uh getting molten dingy or or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grain</ENAMEX> plus there was a lot of markings on the on the paint that
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well on top of the bunk beds the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> got up there and uh started drawing on the ceiling and that was kind of hard to get off so we decided rather than uh uh wash it all off and clean it up we decided to paint over it and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		the walls were were textured and there was a lot of holes from the previous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">owners</ENAMEX> and so we patched them all up and painted and and put border and wallpaper along the top
 		and it looks really nice now and we we're quite pleased with it and and uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it uh looks pretty good there's a lot of other things that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheryl</ENAMEX> would like me to do but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's just finding the time
 	
 	
 		yeah  i guess we'll eventually get around to finishing the basement someday i don't know when
 	
 	
 		well good good uh
 	
 	
 		i think i might uh paint the uh cement you can there's supposedly kind of a cement paint you can get that uh will make it just a little nicer even you know before we finish it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		well good you uh you put on a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">deck deck</ENAMEX> there recently too haven't you or that's been a couple of years
 	
 	
 		well parts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cement cement</ENAMEX> had a patio i painted the uh our porch
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		that was kind of a job  had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eighty eight</NUMEX> spindles to sand and take all the paint off borrowed an air <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">gun</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laura</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> in law and it uh
 	
 	
 		yeah i imagine it would be
 		wow
 		painted it with
 	
 	
 		yeah and that worked nice it's just one of those <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wagner</ENAMEX> ones you know they
 	
 	
 		well good
 		yeah we have one
 	
 	
 		they work pretty well really they're noisy
 	
 	
 		yes i
 		yeah they are they they make a lot of noise but they're good
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		we haven't used ours yet we'd like to use ours
 	
 	
 		you haven't used it at all
 	
 	
 		no i haven't
 	
 	
 		oh so you don't you don't know how uh wait the only thing you've got to worry about is getting the paint the right viscosity
 	
 	
 		yeah so it doesn't jam up
 	
 	
 		you've used one before though it sounds like
 	
 	
 		yes i have
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it was my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX>'s and i i used it with him
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		was able to paint some things and uh
 		and he said he didn't need it anymore and he he gave it to us and we haven't had a chance to or need to paint anything down here yet i i'm kind of leery about using it inside
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um because it does put a lot of particles and mist in the air that i didn't want to get all over the carpet or
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah it puts out a lot and i mean i even ordered us that one when we did that porch
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i mean there was  had the i had my watch and it was all over my shoes and uh the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">shrubs</ENAMEX> all turned white down there
 	
 	
 		
 
 		it it snowed huh that's about the only snow we can get down here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> if it if it were a white paint you probably used a a uh redwood color or a stain didn't you
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		it was just it was white
 	
 	
 		oh it was
 	
 	
 		yeah because the porch the porch spindles are white
 	
 	
 		yeah that's right that's right
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		it was a latex we had a hard time getting it thin enough because latex is kind of rubbery to begin with a little thicker than most but it ended up working fine plus i was the weather you know i did it in uh
 	
 	
 		oh
 		yes
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		oh good
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the winter</TIMEX> started to to cool down i think it must have been <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX> when i finished
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah i remember it was a conference <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekend</TIMEX> i think when i finished
 	
 	
 		well the the weather i understand was pretty good at that time
 	
 	
 		yeah it was it was not bad but
 	
 	
 		yeah the weather
 		weather is beautiful down here real nice real nice it got up to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about seventy five degrees</NUMEX> down here and that's kind of the right temperature to be painting things but
 	
 	
 		is it
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah it's uh we would like to like to do a little bit more we'll probably do some we were working recently out on our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">spa</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">hum-um</ENAMEX>
