 
     		
 	
 		well let's go ahead and start with you what kind of kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pets</ENAMEX> did you have
 	
 	
 		
 
 		okay well yeah when i was growing up uh we had dogs all the time so i always had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> i think at the most we had three
 		and uh then when i met my my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> she was more of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> and she kind of more or less got me converted over to <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		uh oh
 	
 	
 		and that was the last <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pets</ENAMEX> that we had um but uh we we went ahead and gave them away to
 		uh another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> you know i put an ad out and had them had them take over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pets</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> because we had uh we started our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> and
 		and you know the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> shed a lot and plus they were kind of rough for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">babies</ENAMEX> playing with them and stuff so
 	
 	
 		right
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		we decided to not have any <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pets</ENAMEX> for awhile
 	
 	
 		well cool
 		uh when i was growing up we had a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog one dog</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		it had a disease and we had to put it to sleep and that was traumatic and that was traumatic enough for our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> for the time being and
 	
 	
 		oh no
 		
  
 		
 
 	
 	
 		they have another <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> right now at home but i'm not there so that's kind of a bummer but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah well we're thinking of maybe as a matter of fact my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> was was telling me that uh when she was out <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas shopping</TIMEX>
 		ah they had a display for one of these pet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> and
 		they had a a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> there and turned out to be ah an older <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about two years old</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and uh it was really good with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> i've i've got <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> boys
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four years old</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years old</TIMEX>
 		and she said it was real good with them and uh real
 		real <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">tame cat</ENAMEX>
 		and she was asking me you know when do you think we should go back and get it now or should we wait a little bit longer and  and i told her well i think we should probably wait
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but i you know she's she's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gonna</ENAMEX> want uh get <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">least another</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> uh but i think i'd like to go ahead and get get them a dog
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		cool yeah i kind of like <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> myself i think they're just fun to have around fun to play with
 	
 	
 		i think you know i really do think that a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> is more of a a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>'s pet and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>'s more of an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult</ENAMEX>'s pet
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		
  
 		yeah i tend to agree with that
 	
 	
 		because uh i know i i when i was younger and uh growing up with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> i didn't like <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> at all i didn't want anything at all to do with them
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		because you know they just don't respond to you the way <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> do
 		and you know that and i you know i feel that that's something that  that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kid</ENAMEX> looks forward to
 	
 	
 		oh absolutely
 	
 	
 		you know you tell a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> to do something and it does it or you throw a ball and he chases it that kind of thing and he'll  he'll play with you but a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		pretty much just keeps to himself and
 		you know you know how <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX> are
 	
 	
 		right  well i kind of tend to agree i think especially dogs i really when we had ours i enjoyed it just because like you say you know you could throw things at it and he'd go chase it and
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		that whenever  there was you know any sense of of urgency or any sense of problems with any of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> or anybody around our family
 		he would just jump up there and protect us you know he was a small <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> and it was just it was good to know that there was always somebody there or something there to to take care of you
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah i i agree i agree
 		i know that uh
 		you know your <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">yard</ENAMEX> is always a safe haven and and then if you have got a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> back there  then you're really protected because they they'll they'll stand up for you
 	
 	
 		yeah exactly
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and that's the i i guess i kind of miss that you know my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		well our our the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pets</ENAMEX> that i grew up with all either ran away or died
 		a long time ago and my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dad</ENAMEX> just recently got another <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> and it ran away
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		oh no
 	
 	
 		but it was a real small <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> and he's thinking of getting another one i don't know if he will or not but he wants to get another dog my mom
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mom</ENAMEX> can go either way
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		she doesn't really care too much  as long as it's clean
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah well that's a big thing too at our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> it was we couldn't let it in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> but the thing that i think my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> used it most for was to teach us responsibility
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know it was our <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> and we had to take care of it and if we didn't there was you know definite
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		definite
 	
 	
 		yeah i agree
 	
 	
 		repercussion
 	
 	
 		i think probably i'd be happier happier with just a ordinary mutt you know you get a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> that's uh show quality and you know you got to be real careful with it and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yep i agree i think i think a lot of times the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mutts</ENAMEX> the best <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX> anyway just because they're you know
 		they really don't you know you care enough about them to to take care of them but not so much that you're worried about what you do with them
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		where as if you're paying <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">millions of dollars</NUMEX> for it i think you'd be a little more concerned
 	
 	
 		yeah that that you know i don't wanna get into a thing where you take him to shows and and you know all these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX> and stuff and you got to be careful and all this and that
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		you know not that you wouldn't take care of it any less but that just something you know i don't want my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boys</ENAMEX> to have to to get into that kind of thing
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah well i agree i think it's it's a lot more fun when you don't have to worry about the cost of what you spent on it as much as just having it as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> and
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		sure
 		basically a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">companion</ENAMEX> and that's it
 	
 	
 		yeah exactly and that's
 		you know it was really weird because although we fought a lot about it you know and who was gonna take care of it when we had it we really all missed it when it was gone
 	
 	
 		
 
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and so
 	
 	
 		i reckon i can agree with that
 		well it was nice talking to y ou
 	
 	
 		hey it's been my pleasure you have a great afternoon
 	
 	
 		all right you too take care bye-bye
 	
 	
 		thanks bye-bye
