 
     		
 	
 		and
 	
 	
 		
 
 		all right well
 	
 	
 		i mean short term i don't think anything's gonna be done about it
 	
 	
 		well i
 	
 	
 		or probably should be done about it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> are you saying you didn't think anything should be done in the short term
 	
 	
 		uh the short term the recession is getting getting top attention
 	
 	
 		yeah well i i think that you're absolutely right there the other thing is is that we've got these um
 		these all these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX> defaults going on and and savings and loan defaults and and uh
 		uh
 	
 	
 		and that effectively adds to it whether it's officially on the books or not
 	
 	
 		right exactly
 		um
 	
 	
 		and that's got to be paid
 	
 	
 		exactly and and uh so this creates a pretty serious problem that's going to continue to be with us for a while to come um i'm not really
 		uh sure that i even understand why the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> is proposing for instance tax reductions because it seems to me that if if if they're talking about reducing
 		uh the tax that needs to be paid or the taxes taxes currently being paid then that can't it seems to me it can't possibly  you know help with the the deficit picture
 	
 	
 		it can only hurt the deficit picture
 	
 	
 		yeah exactly
 	
 	
 		um
 		and the the severity of the deficit picture already
 		limits
 		the options available or limits the degree of tax cutting you can do without uh bringing on on serious problems for the longer term
 	
 	
 		yeah exactly
 	
 	
 		so that that that's the current predicament
 	
 	
 		yeah it seems seems like it's it's a kind of a catch <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty two</TIMEX> i mean it's it's the um
 		my understanding is what they're trying to what what supposedly they're trying to do by reducing taxes is to kind of jump start the economy the idea being that
 		if <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have to pay less money in taxes they'll have more money to spend uh and if they have more money to spend then that will be a a spur to productivity particularly commercial productivity
 		uh which in turn will generate revenue but it it seems like like uh
 		it's sort of a uh a spiral an unending spiral and it it uh i'm i'm not sure that there's any real genuine truth to the uh the idea that that uh
 		that decreasing taxes particularly the kinds that are are being recommended by by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> and things like capital gains taxes and so forth is going to uh result
 		in substantial amounts of money you know for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> to spend
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm not sure how i feel about
 		tagging them to share the cost of
 		yeah the the long term quests that tax cuts are worth at this point it's partly a judgment of how bad the recession is
 	
 	
 		yeah it uh it would seem to me that that there are other things that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> could do
 	
 	
 		well look <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of all you look to the fed to fight the recession as indeed it has with interest rates
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		um-hum i think that's been a positive development i think what that's done is it's it's it's helped keep inflation from
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		um uh
 	
 	
 		well at the moment we're doing very well on inflation
 	
 	
 		yeah exactly and it's a sort of a piece of luck
 	
 	
 		that's the sort of upside to the deficit that's that's the upside to the recession
 	
 	
 		yeah um
 		i don't know what kind of things do you think can be done in in uh in the long term
 	
 	
 		and the longer well can be done or will be done are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different things um
 		at various places to look for for cutting the budget <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of all i consider more defense cuts than are already planned
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		depending on the world situation
 		but there are various other areas such as as farm subsidies that ought to be slashed ah a lot of entitlement programs like education aid i think ah
 		they should've put a in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administrations</ENAMEX> took took took  layoff such entitlements to the to the poor but left them for the middle class
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		ah in the longer term ah we we we'd do well i think to make to make uh reductions there also somewhat related  is to collect money that's owed to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> from various loan programs that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> have borrowed
 	
 	
 		right i think that i i think that that i agree with you certainly in the second
 		situation and i think certain entitlements i i'm inclined to agree with you too education happens to be one place where i think that we would foolish to um uh
 	
 	
 		a lot of the education aid has gone to so called trade schools
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		which are so there not <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">colleges</ENAMEX> but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> that
 		teach you trades you know beauticians whatever at more and often exists only because of the federal programs that they can take <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and tell them they can get loans for their full tuition
 	
 	
 		oh i see what you're i see what you're saying
 	
 	
 		ah and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> gets paid off immediately ah they don't provide very much education and uh
 	
 	
 		and then the
 		and then the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> default on the loans
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		well i i would have to agree with you if there are circumstances like that uh around
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">uh</ENAMEX> and i i i can't confess to having any substantial knowledge of that sort of thing but but but taking what you're saying at face value then i would have to agree with completely
 	
 	
 		yeah
