 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		this is a kind of ironic subject for me because this is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first year</TIMEX> um
 		i purchased i mean i i was actually able to uh get some credit cards because i'm <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty one</TIMEX> and i got it through school
 	
 	
 		oh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh
 		and i i've kind of you know you kind of make a purchase and you and you forget you know what you put on your credit card and you know within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a month</TIMEX> you know they send you your bill and uh
 		i i'm <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about three thousand dollars</NUMEX> in debt right now
 	
 	
 		oh dear  it can add up in a hurry
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah they do i mean it's amazing it's like a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">an</NUMEX> an <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> or a sickness or something
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		well it's it's uh it's easy to use there's no doubt about them i've had i've had one for oh probably <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten years</TIMEX> now
 		and if you can if you pay it off <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every month</TIMEX> generally generally you're okay um our experience has been um we usually pay it off each month but around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> time
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		we sometimes have to slide <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a month or a month or so</TIMEX> to
 	
 	
 		yeah <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> time i can understand but what my after i got <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> i didn't just stop i got i've got <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about five</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah get caught up
 		oh uh-huh they'll send you one about every time you turn around
 	
 	
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six six</NUMEX> credit cards yeah and uh
 		so i just charged a little on each and uh and you just get the um
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		
  
 	
 	
 		the adding machine out and you add it up and it's it's amazing
 	
 	
 		well you see these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> that cut there's up say it's time to
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		we went to we went on vacation and uh
 		and i charged a lot you know just well i charged um like clothes for the vacation and then on the vacation you know charged your hotel
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah
 		right
 	
 	
 		and then you know when you got to eat you charge the rest i mean you know it's so convenient and
 	
 	
 		oh and there's uh
 	
 	
 		and you just don't i guess you know i'm just really stupid i just didn't realize
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well i like them for a couple of aspects one is you don't have to carry a lot of cash with you
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and the other is you know you got that statement and you can make one payment you don't have to write out a bunch of checks or always be paying for things it's convenient from that standpoint
 		so it's it's nice from that standpoint from that angle but it can get out of hand in the interest rate on them is is quite high generally there are some that are lower you know you can get some that are
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh probably around twelve thirteen percent but most are around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixteen to eighteen</TIMEX> or higher
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		yeah i have a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> that um she's married and her and her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> uh
 		she said you know they tried really hard to pay them off and it took them <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three years</TIMEX> before they were able to uh pay off their credit cards
 	
 	
 		okay
 		yeah although you know they keep increasing your limit too you know i had a card that uh
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		well i think it started out with like a fifteen <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">hundred dollar</NUMEX> limit
 		and i've had it for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several years</TIMEX> and i think i'm now <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">up to uh seven thousand five hundred</NUMEX> on it
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i mean i'm not course i don't always spend that much but that's what they'd let me spend if i wanted to
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		i guess they they get to trusting you a little bit and
 		i want to hold that bait out i don't know if the card <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> that you have usually around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> time they'll they'll send you a little <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of checks
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		say instead of using your credit card if you want to just go ahead and write these checks and we'll charge it'll go right against your account they they try to induce you during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Christmas season</TIMEX> to to wrack up a few more dollars
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		so i think they're good but you've got to be careful
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		
  
 		that'd be my overall summary
 	
 	
 		i think it was hard for me because i wasn't working at the time and i was just going to school
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		and it was like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every weekend</TIMEX> i would just
 		it's it was like sickness to me and i just got and just
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		spend uh but
 	
 	
 		well  i don't know  everybody likes them at least for a couple of things they're they're handy they're nice on when you travel
 	
 	
 		just yeah
 	
 	
 		well what kind do you have
 	
 	
 		um i have a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Discover</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Visa</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sears</ENAMEX> and i have like most of the department <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah well the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Discover</ENAMEX> one is supposed to pay you back a little bit
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		have you experienced that or not
 	
 	
 		i have um i have maxed that one
 	
 	
 		what have you well that's uh i think that one's sponsored by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sears</ENAMEX> if i
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah it is and i got the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sears</ENAMEX> through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Discover</ENAMEX> before i had um
 		and i didn't even know i went over my limit i mean that's i just didn't even add it up i don't know i'm just
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		i was just going crazy
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		and there's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about fourteen hundred</NUMEX> dollars on that card
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		well it can it doesn't take long
 		i i just ordered a video camera <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> and that's why that always bothers me a little bit to give your credit card <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">number</ENAMEX> over the telephone but i
 	
 	
 		um-hum i wouldn't do that i would not do that i've seen on TV and and there's too many scams
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and there there can be there's no doubt about it we've
