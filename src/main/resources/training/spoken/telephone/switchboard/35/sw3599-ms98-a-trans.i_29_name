 		freezing
 	
 	
 		is it dry or wet
 	
 	
 		um it's
 		um it's it's been pretty dry yeah it it rained but we had a problem with a little bit of a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> shortage but it rained for a bit but the last <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about three four days</TIMEX> i guess you probably had a cold front last week
 		but uh they said that it was coming across the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> but the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last few days</TIMEX> has been like really cold it was down to about thirteen degrees
 		um <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> when i woke up it's starting to warm up a little bit now but we haven't got any <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">snow</ENAMEX> yet just a couple of sprinkles here and there
 	
 	
 		well we haven't had cold weather we've just had <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rain</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rain</ENAMEX> and more rain
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		this is our <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> consecutive day of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rain</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">weather man</ENAMEX> is promising us <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least four</NUMEX> more <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> of rain
 	
 	
 		is it you say in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		yeah in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> and we're on the verge and it's going to happen either <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</TIMEX> of setting an all time record for most <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rain</ENAMEX> in a year
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		our normal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rainfall</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">twenty nine inches</NUMEX> and we're already <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">up to over fifty inches</NUMEX>
 	
 	
 		wow that's wild
 	
 	
 		and it's and it's coming down and coming down it's
 		it is been raining <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all year</TIMEX> at an incredible pace
 	
 	
 		that's pretty wild
 	
 	
 		i know we're about to float away
 	
 	
 		it's usually pretty i guess <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty nine</TIMEX> is pretty dry it's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> is kind of in the desert huh
 	
 	
 		well it's not really in desert the desert
 		starts
 		<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about fifty miles</NUMEX> west of here is where the desert sort of starts
 		but <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">twenty nine inches</NUMEX> is is our normal we have very
 		dry summers
 		and uh spring time is usually fairly wet but <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this time of year</TIMEX> is fairly dry and we're having
 		spring time rain right now
 	
 	
 		well how how <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cold</ENAMEX> has it been
 	
 	
 		oh it's uh pretty warm it's <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about fifty three degrees</NUMEX> or so
 		uh so it's not cold but it's just wet
 	
 	
 		yeah i lived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oregon</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three years</TIMEX> so i know what that's about
 	
 	
 		what is it warm but wet up there
 	
 	
 		yeah i used to it wasn't super warm during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the winter</TIMEX> it would be you know forty <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> fifty degrees most of the time but always a sprinkling type rain
 		uh in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> you get when it rains you get like real showers sometimes you never got that out there  but uh
 		but here it it  it rains <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about forty</NUMEX> i guess <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about forty two forty two inches</NUMEX> a year yeah i know we had a little bit of a a drought <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> as a matter of fact because the water supply in our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">reservoirs</ENAMEX> was a little low
 	
 	
 		well we're not having any problem like that the last time we had drought around here was nineteen eighty when we really got very little <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rain</ENAMEX> but since then it's been normal and then this is about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fourth year</TIMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a row</TIMEX> where we've had above average rain
 		<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> we had <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about forty five inches</NUMEX> and
 		which is well above and now what we're having <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> so it's been tremendous rainfall
 	
 	
 		does it do any damage i mean you have floods or anything like that or
 	
 	
 		uh some areas have had some flooding the worst flooding occurs in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the spring</TIMEX> time when some when our main river around here the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trinity River</ENAMEX> goes over its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX> and
 		causes damage but uh for the most part they've been trying to deal with that
 		although the traffic is horrible
 	
 	
 		when it rains
 	
 	
 		when it rains oh yes everything comes to a a standstill with the rain <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this morning</TIMEX> it took me <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes extra</TIMEX> to get to work
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i found that i used to commute i used to live in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York City</ENAMEX> and commute out to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Long Island</ENAMEX> which is in the suburbs and uh it was normally <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about an hour and fifteen minutes hour and a half</TIMEX> drive it'd take
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
 
 		there was really a lot of traffic but it was like pretty good flowing traffic and then it would get really bad when when it rain  together you know takes whatever
 	
 	
 		is your is your weather now normal for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this time of year</TIMEX> or is it different
 	
 	
 		uh yeah it's pretty normal <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> is pretty normal <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> it's probably about  <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty thirty five</TIMEX> degree well maybe <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> degrees out now and it's supposed to go up to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">forty</NUMEX> and then that's about normal we don't
 		we don't usually stay below freezing uh for long periods of time
 		uh you know we have cold spells that that happen but but aside from that usually the temperature probably average temperature is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">thirty five forty degrees</NUMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the winter</TIMEX> so this is kind of normal
 	
 	
 		well we had we had early freezes here we had our
 		a normal freeze is around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">twentieth</ENAMEX> and we had our freeze <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November second and between the second</TIMEX> and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tenth</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November</TIMEX> in those <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eight days</TIMEX> we set record lows <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eight days</TIMEX>
 		and so we thought we were going to really have a cold <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> but since then it's the temperatures have been normal it's just that the rain has been incredible
 	
 	
 		yeah that's what happened here <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> we had we had uh a lot of cold early on and then it and then <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the winter</TIMEX> was relatively mild i think they i think it's going to be a cold <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter this year</TIMEX> though because of that volcano in uh
 	
 	
 		oh in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philippines</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philippines</ENAMEX> that's supposed to like cover up the uh or rather raise the warming layers and stuff like that so it's probably going to be <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a couple degrees</NUMEX> cooler
 	
 	
 		well i don't know what i don't know if that volcano caused all this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rain</ENAMEX> but something's been causing all this rain
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		it could it could it could cause rain i'm not sure but
