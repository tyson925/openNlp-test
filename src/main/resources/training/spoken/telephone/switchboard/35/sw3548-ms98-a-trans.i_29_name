 		well i'm impressed
 		no do you cook much
 	
 	
 		uh  well i'm in charge of the barbecue  i think that is pretty common once in a while i'll cook uh i'll cook <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> dinner and we'll have uh

 		oh is that right does that take long to just have to heat it up is that all oh
 	
 	
 		that's right  well it was one of those smoked ones so it was pretty good
 	
 	
 		oh
 		i never tried those
 	
 	
 		yeah it was pretty good it we got it we got it real cheap is why we got it and i'll probably do it <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</TIMEX> to it saved an awful lot of work
 	
 	
 		oh
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		yeah that
 		that <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">turkey</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about a three or four hour</TIMEX> project you have to keep checking on it and see if that little thing pops up and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that's right see mine never came out good anyway so i figure  it's not gonna come out well i might as well not waste all my time on it and just get something
 	
 	
 		oh
 		um-hum  oh what's worked well for us is put one of those um cooking bags that seems to have helped things a little bit yeah they just slip i guess you've seen them they're plastic
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		yeah i've never really tried one though
 	
 	
 		and they don't they don't seem to melt obviously but uh they keep it uh warm moist and tender
 	
 	
 		huh

 		oh
 	
 	
 		and the toof - days after i got off the jury one of my topics <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first day</TIMEX> was what do you think of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">juries</ENAMEX> and and the jury system and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next day</TIMEX> was what do you think of capital punishment so it was pretty funny because i had a lot to say on that
