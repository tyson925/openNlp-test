 		well it's been beautiful <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</TIMEX> about uh seventy two something like that it's gotten cooler <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> i think it's probably sixty
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy oh boy</ENAMEX> that's nice and warm
 	
 	
 		but sunshiny yeah oh yeah it is a little bit warm right now
 	
 	
 		what's the humidity like
 	
 	
 		we don't have high humidity like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Houston</ENAMEX> does it's probably
 		gee i don't know <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> uh-huh where we have a little bit of humidity but not like the southern part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> does because we're up the north of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Red River</ENAMEX> so
 	
 	
 		now you're in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> is that what you
 		not like
 		right
 		so at that
 	
 	
 		oh probably <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixty fifty sixty</TIMEX>
 	
 	
 		pretty pretty average for this time of the year
 	
 	
 		no it's a little bit below above average i would think our average now is around
 		<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">sixty five</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sixty to sixty five</TIMEX> something like that i don't really know but ah it's it's warmer than it normally is this time of year
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		course didn't you have some uh  was it tornado watches not too long ago or hurricane or something
 		maybe it wasn't right in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> but uh a flush flash floods or
 	
 	
 		uh-huh no we
 		oh we always so a lot of times we do have flooding when because it's so much cement here now the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> doesn't have anywhere to go because it's built up so much but
 	
 	
 		it's built up so much
 	
 	
 		yeah that  i think they didn't think about the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> when the they paved everything
 	
 	
 		right right don't think where it's gonna have to go huh
 	
 	
 		
  
 		that's true but yeah we even have flash flooding come you know if we get <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">five inches</NUMEX> of rain we do have flooding so if it's quickly you know real quick yeah that's true what where are you in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Idaho</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		if it comes pretty quickly and
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Twin Falls</ENAMEX> it that's kind of by uh have you heard of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sun Valley</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boise</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Twin Falls</ENAMEX>
 		i've been through <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Twin Falls</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several years ago</TIMEX> yeah it's beautiful out there really is nice yeah it really is nice
 	
 	
 		oh have you then you know where i am
 		yeah it's it's kind of pretty
 		we don't have uh any <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">snow</ENAMEX> on the ground it
 	
 	
 		what is your temperature
 	
 	
 		it's probably in the forties
 	
 	
 		yeah well we're supposed to get i think to the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirties</TIMEX> tonight
 	
 	
 		are you
 	
 	
 		so it's cooling up makes you feel a little bit better
 	
 	
 		for that's a real switch though <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">from seventy five in the morning</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> though
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		we we probably go from the forties to the twenties
 	
 	
 		yeah well we don't have that too often but it's gradually clearing off i think <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> was in the seventies because i haven't heard the temperature <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> really but i did go shopping and it's cooler than it was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> but it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right may be
 		do you need a jacket
 	
 	
 		uh yes <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a light one</NUMEX> i didn't wear one because i don't like a jacket i just wore a sweatshirt but no jacket yeah but it's beautiful and uh
 	
 	
 		and that does it
 	
 	
 		but  i i have never seen a white <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> so we we don't usually
 	
 	
 		you don't know what it is  everybody around here is gone crazy because they want a white <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX> and
 	
 	
 		no i've never seen huh-uh
 		well i did i would like to have one too but i yeah i i think it'd be great
 	
 	
 		they're pretty they're they uh they're the type of thing you only wanna have once  they're not as fun to drive in but they're sure
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah it i mean gets you in the spirit but we have cold weather sometimes and most of our cold weather is in like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January January and February</TIMEX> but we had some cold weather in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November</TIMEX> so it's just crazy
 	
 	
 		
 
 		and uh you just don't know exactly what to expect when it goes like that do you kind of
 	
 	
 		no  well yeah it it gets <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cold</ENAMEX> here it's just that it doesn't stay cold like i'm not sure how it is where you are but you know in the northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> it gets <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cold</ENAMEX> and stays cold all winter
 	
 	
 		
 
 		stays that way  and the snow usually stays
 	
 	
 		yeah and here right and here we be get <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cold</ENAMEX> and we may be cold for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a week</TIMEX> you know down in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the twenties</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teens</ENAMEX> and then it's back up to the forties and fifties yeah so it's it's
 	
 	
 		right
 		then it shoots back up
 		this uh our area pretty much you get oh we got snow for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thanksgiving</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about three days later</TIMEX> it was all gone so i'd it doesn't stick around very long
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		do you think your weather trends are changing
 	
 	
 		well you know we've only lived here <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four and a half years</TIMEX> and uh  it's been fairly mild
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		from what i understand uh they've they've talked about being snowed in and and we've never had a bad bad winter
 	
 	
 		well i i yeah i think the weather trends are changing too now i don't know whether it's everywhere or just here because we've had so many lakes built around here that i think it
 	
 	
 		right do you think that's making a difference
 	
 	
 		oh yeah yeah i think it's making the difference in that we have more bad weather than we used to uh-huh especially storms
 	
 	
 		than you're used to
 	
 	
 		but you they built the lakes for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> and i do think it's made a difference in the the weather here
 	
 	
 		i think the weather seems like it's changed everywhere a little bit hasn't it just uh real peculiar peculiar and not normal
 	
 	
 		yeah well
 		well i guess it's part of the warming trends and then too they say the that uh volcano in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philippines</ENAMEX> you know had a effect on well uh
 	
 	
 		right
 		right we got a lot of the effects from that that and that's hard to believe isn't it you wouldn't you wouldn't think we could even be remotely
 	
 	
 		supposedly i know
