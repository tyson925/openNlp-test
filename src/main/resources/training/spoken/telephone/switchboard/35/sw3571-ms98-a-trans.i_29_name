 		yeah that's true
 		yeah
 		hum <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boy</ENAMEX> we can't go very far with this subject
 	
 	
 		i don't know i what kind of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter winter</TIMEX> are we gonna have this year
 	
 	
 		oh i don't know hopefully not too bad well bad enough so it kills all the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fleas</ENAMEX> and bugs and whatever see we have to have our freeze for probably a week
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but aside from that i hope it's still warm
 		not too cold maybe maybe maybe well maybe a little <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">snow</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas Eve</TIMEX> or something would be nice but it doesn't look good
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		they were saying that the freeze <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last winter</TIMEX> did you see i don't know if you saw on TV about the uh the migration uh not the migration but all the crickets that they had this year
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		did you see it they were saying they were saying that was caused from a very mild winter
 	
 	
 		oh it was amazing
 	
 	
 		that that the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> didn't that the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> did not kill all of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX> like it normally does
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		
 
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		but i was out  i work out in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Plano</ENAMEX> at a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX> out there and they just uh i mean the my whole <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> was covered with them
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>
 		oh what <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX> is it
 	
 	
 		i hope
 	
 	
 		oh okay all right i work out in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Plano</ENAMEX> too i was just wondering if it was near where i am
 	
 	
 		
 
 		but i mean it it was it was i couldn't i couldn't believe all of them
 	
 	
 		yeah i remember going to work <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX> and just crunching on the stairs it was terrible
 	
 	
 		oh it was unbelievable we couldn't see our parking we couldn't see our parking lot hey i'm not i'm not kidding we got pictures of it we could not see our parking lot
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that's pretty bad for a restaurant i guess probably doesn't help your business
 	
 	
 		yeah it is well it didn't it well it didn't hurt it though that's the bad thing
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		didn't hurt it they weren't on the inside they were just on the outside of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> just hanging around
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		huh well it's in here we started to get some in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX> now i i wonder if it's because it's getting cool out  and they want to come in
 	
 	
 		yeah they want to they go towards the heat that's why that's why they were coming out of the ground when it first started getting cool they came out of the ground because it was warmer
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yes
 		and into the house
 	
 	
 		yeah well yeah they like coming into the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> but they were going crawling crawling up our building up into the eave where it was warm
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh huh
 	
 	
 		where the lights were and everything
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 		huh
 	
 	
 		but hopefully uh we'll have a nice hard <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</TIMEX> and it'll kill them all this year because i don't wanna put up with that again
 	
 	
 		yeah i know i know i mean it sounds cool to say but yeah it was pretty
 	
 	
 		uh a bug's a bug who cares
 	
 	
 		and i ended up spraying for them anyway after a while i think
 	
 	
 		oh we spent a couple of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">thousand dollars</NUMEX> on getting the getting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX> sprayed and everything
 	
 	
 		yeah i bet you do huh you probably have to do that a lot of times during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> don't you
 	
 	
 		oh yeah well we get we spray <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</TIMEX> just as just as a maintenance but uh i mean this was like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every other day</TIMEX> he was coming out there with his <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">truck</ENAMEX> he normally doesn't spray with a truck
 	
 	
 		oh oh
 		hum
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uh-huh</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		but he was having to come out there with a big truck and uh just douse the douse the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">grass</ENAMEX> and everything else
 	
 	
 		
 
 		wow yeah i guess you'd have to you don't want bugs in there that's for sure um
 	
 	
 		oh i know it
 		but i'm i'm ready for a little snow though got to have a little bit <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">couple of days</TIMEX> anyway  maybe shut shut down shut down work but i doubt it maybe where i can stay home <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few days</TIMEX> and and play in the snow with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kids</ENAMEX>
 	
 	
 		<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">um-hum</ENAMEX>

 		hm
 		yeah
 		well as long as i don't have to drive in it
 	
 	
 		oh i know
 	
 	
 		that's that's the lousy part
 	
 	
 		yeah i know and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Texans</ENAMEX> don't know how to drive in it anyway
 	
 	
 		oh well i'm not from here but yeah i never really did learn  so
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah

 		i i i know it
 		well the maybe if they're listening to this maybe if they when they listen to this maybe they can set that up a little better
 	
 	
 		yeah well it's probably just whoever is around or has the right <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> on their sheet so they can call because it's getting hard to find <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> now
 	
 	
 		yeah
