            After the attacks had occurred, while crisis <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> were still sorting out a number
                of unnerving false alarms, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force One</ENAMEX> flew to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Barksdale Air Force Base</ENAMEX> in
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Louisiana</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of these alarms was of a reported threat against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force One</ENAMEX>
                itself, a threat eventually run down to a misunderstood communication in the hectic
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House Situation Room</ENAMEX> that <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX>.
            
            While the plan at the elementary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> had been to return to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>, by the time
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force One</ENAMEX> was airborne at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:55 A.M.</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Secret Service</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX>'s
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">advisers</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheney</ENAMEX> were strongly advising against it. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> reluctantly acceded to this advice and, at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 10:10</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force One</ENAMEX> changed
                course and began heading due west. The immediate objective was to find a safe
                location-not too far away-where the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> could land and speak to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Secret Service</ENAMEX> was also interested in refueling the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> and paring
                down the size of the traveling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX>'s military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aide</ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX>, quickly researched the options and, sometime <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">around 10:20</TIMEX>, identified
                <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Barksdale Air Force Base</ENAMEX> as an appropriate interim destination.
            
            When <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">One</ENAMEX> landed at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barksdale</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 11:45</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> from the local
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Secret Service</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> were still en route to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airfield</ENAMEX>. The motorcade consisted
                of a military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> lead <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicle</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">van</ENAMEX>; the proposed briefing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">theater</ENAMEX> had no
                phones or electrical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">outlets</ENAMEX>. Staff scrambled to prepare another <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> for the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX>'s remarks, while the lead <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Secret Service</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> reviewed the security
                situation with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">superiors</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> completed his statement, which
                for security reasons was taped and not broadcast live, and the traveling party
                returned to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force One</ENAMEX>. The next destination was discussed: once again the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Secret</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Service</ENAMEX> recommended against returning to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> agreed.
                <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Offutt Air Force Base</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nebraska</ENAMEX> was chosen because of its elaborate command and
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX>, and because it could accommodate overnight lodging for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Secret Service</ENAMEX> wanted a place where the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> could spend several
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>, if necessary.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force One</ENAMEX> arrived at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Offutt</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2:50 P.M. At about 3:15</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> met with
                his principal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisers</ENAMEX> through a secure video teleconference.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rice</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> began the meeting with the words, "We're at war," and that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central Intelligence</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Tenet</ENAMEX> said
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> was still assessing who was responsible, but the early signs all pointed
                to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="TIME">.6That evening</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deputies Committee</ENAMEX> returned to the pending
                presidential directive they had labored over during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX>.
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX> of defense directed the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s armed forces to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Defense Condition 3</ENAMEX>,
                an increased state of military readiness.
            
            For the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time in history, all nonemergency civilian <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX> were grounded, stranding <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tens of thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> across the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>.
                Contingency plans for the continuity of government and the evacuation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> had
                been implemented. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> had been struck; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Capitol</ENAMEX> had
                narrowly escaped direct attack. Extraordinary security precautions were put in place
                at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s borders and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ports</ENAMEX>.
            In <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the late afternoon</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> overruled his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aides</ENAMEX>' continuing reluctance to
                have him return to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> and ordered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force One</ENAMEX> back to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Andrews Air Force</ENAMEX>
                Base. He was flown by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">helicopter</ENAMEX> back to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>, passing over the
                still-smoldering <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX>. At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:30 that evening</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> addressed the nation
                from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>. After emphasizing that the first priority was to help the
                injured and protect against any further attacks, he said: "We will make no
                distinction between the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX> who committed these acts and those who harbor
                them." He quoted <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Psalm</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX>-"though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death .
                . ." No <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX>, he said,"will ever forget this day."
            
            Following his speech, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> met again with his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Security Council</ENAMEX>
                (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSC</ENAMEX>), expanded to include <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transportation</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norman Mineta</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joseph</ENAMEX>
                Allbaugh, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Emergency Management Agency</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> of
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Colin Powell</ENAMEX>, who had returned from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Peru</ENAMEX> after hearing of the attacks, joined
                the discussion. They reviewed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX>'s events.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMMEDIATE RESPONSES AT HOME</ENAMEX>
            As the urgent domestic issues accumulated, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> Deputy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chief of Staff</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joshua</ENAMEX>
                Bolten chaired a temporary "domestic consequences" <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>.
            
            The agenda in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">those first days</TIMEX> is worth noting, partly as a checklist for future
                crisis <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planners</ENAMEX>. It began with problems of how to help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> and stanch the
                flowing losses to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> economy, such as
            
                Organizing federal emergency assistance. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> question was what kind of public
                    health advice to give about the air quality in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lower Manhattan</ENAMEX> in the vicinity
                    of the fallen <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>.
                
                Compensating <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX>. They evaluated legislative options, eventually setting
                    up a federal compensation fund and defining the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">powers</ENAMEX> of a special <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">master</ENAMEX> to
                    run it.
                Determining federal assistance. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 13</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> promised to
                    provide <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$20 billion</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York City</ENAMEX>, in addition to the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$20 billion</NUMEX> his budget
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> had already guessed might be needed for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> as a whole.
                
                Restoring civil aviation. On <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 13</TIMEX>, the national
                    airspace reopened for use by <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airports</ENAMEX> that met newly improvised security
                    standards.
                Reopening the financial markets. After extraordinary emergency efforts
                    involving the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury Department</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Securities and</ENAMEX>
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Exchange Commission</ENAMEX>, aided by unprecedented cooperation among the usually
                    competitive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX> of the financial industry, the markets reopened on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX>,
                    <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 17</TIMEX>.
                
                Deciding when and how to return border and port security to more normal
                    operations.
                Evaluating legislative proposals to bail out the airline industry and cap its
                    liability.
            
            The very process of reviewing these issues underscored the absence of an effective
                government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> dedicated to assessing vulnerabilities and handling problems
                of protection and preparedness. Though a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> had some part of the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">task</ENAMEX>, none had security as its primary mission. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 14</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheney</ENAMEX> had decided to recommend, at least as a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step, a new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> entity
                to coordinate all the relevant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> rather than tackle the challenge of
                combining them in a new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX>. This new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> would be a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">homeland</ENAMEX>
                security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adviser</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Homeland Security Council</ENAMEX>-paralleling the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Security</ENAMEX>
                Council system. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheney</ENAMEX> reviewed the proposal with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> and
                other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisers</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> announced the new post and its first <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">occupant</ENAMEX>-
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Ridge</ENAMEX>-in his address to a joint session of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> on
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 20</TIMEX>.
            
            Beginning on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 11</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Immigration and Naturalization Service</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> working in
                cooperation with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> began arresting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> for immigration violations whom
                they encountered while following up leads in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>'s investigation of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX>
                attacks. Eventually, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">768</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aliens</ENAMEX> were arrested as "special interest" detainees. Some
                (such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zacarias Moussaoui</ENAMEX>) were actually in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INS</ENAMEX> custody before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9/11</TIMEX>; most were
                arrested after. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Attorney General</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Ashcroft</ENAMEX> told us that he saw his job in
                directing this effort as "risk minimization," both to find out who had committed the
                attacks and to prevent a subsequent attack. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ashcroft</ENAMEX> ordered all special interest
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immigration</ENAMEX> hearings closed to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX>, family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>, and press; directed
                government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> to seek denial of bond until <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">such time</TIMEX> as they were "cleared"
                of terrorist connections by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>; and ordered the identity of
                the detainees kept secret. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> charged with prosecuting the immigration
                violations had trouble getting information about the detainees and any terrorist
                connections; in the chaos after the attacks, it was very difficult to reach law
                enforcement <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>, who were following up on other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">leads</ENAMEX>. The clearance process
                approved by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX> was time-consuming, lasting an average of about
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">80 days</TIMEX>.
            
            We have assessed this effort to detain <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aliens</ENAMEX> of "special interest." The detainees
                were lawfully held on immigration charges. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Records</ENAMEX> indicate that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">531</NUMEX> were deported,
                <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">162</NUMEX> were released on bond, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> received some kind of immigration benefits, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> had
                their proceedings terminated, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of whom was Moussaoui-were remanded to the
                custody of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Marshals Service</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inspector general</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Department</ENAMEX> found significant problems in the way the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">9/11</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">detainees</ENAMEX> were
                    treated.
            
            In response to a request about the counterterrorism benefits of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX> detainee
                program, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX> cited <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> on the special interest
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">detainee</ENAMEX> list, noting that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> (including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moussaoui</ENAMEX>) were linked directly to a
                terrorist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> and that it had obtained new leads helpful to the
                investigation of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX> terrorist attacks.
            
            A senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> detainee has stated that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> efforts after the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX>
                attacks to monitor the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">homeland</ENAMEX>, including review of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslims</ENAMEX>' immigration
                files and deportation of nonpermanent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX>, forced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> to operate less
                freely in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>.
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s ability to collect intelligence inside the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, and the
                sharing of such information between the intelligence and law enforcement
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX>, was not a priority before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9/11</TIMEX>. Guidelines on this subject issued in
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 2001</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Deputy Attorney General</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">LarryThompson</ENAMEX> essentially recapitulated prior
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">guidance</ENAMEX>. However, the attacks of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX> changed everything. Less than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one week</TIMEX> after
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 11</TIMEX>, an early version of what was to become the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Patriot Act</ENAMEX> (officially,
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">USA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">PATRIOT Act</ENAMEX>) began to take shape.
            
            A central provision of the proposal was the removal of "the wall" on information
                sharing between the intelligence and law enforcement <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> (discussed in
                <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">chapter 3</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ashcroft</ENAMEX> told us he was determined to take every conceivable action,
                within the limits of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Constitution</ENAMEX>, to identify potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX> and deter
                additional attacks.
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> developed a proposal that eventually passed both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> of
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> by large majorities and was signed into law on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 26</TIMEX>.
            
            Flights of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi Nationals Leaving the United States</ENAMEX>
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> questions have arisen with respect to the departure of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Saudi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nationals</ENAMEX> from the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX> in the immediate aftermath of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX>: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) Did any flights of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saudi</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nationals</ENAMEX> take place before national airspace reopened on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 13, 2001</TIMEX>? (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>)
                Was there any political intervention to facilitate the departure of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Saudi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nationals</ENAMEX>?
                (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) Did the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> screen <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Saudi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nationals</ENAMEX> thoroughly before their departure?
            First, we found no evidence that any flights of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Saudi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nationals</ENAMEX>, domestic or
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">international</ENAMEX>, took place before the reopening of national airspace on <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX>
                of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 13</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2001.24</NUMEX> To the contrary, every flight we have identified occurred
                after national airspace reopened.
            
            <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, we found no evidence of political intervention. We found no evidence that
                anyone at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> above the level of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Clarke</ENAMEX> participated in a
                decision on the departure of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Saudi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nationals</ENAMEX>. The issue came up in one of the many
                video teleconferences of the interagency group <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> chaired, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> said he
                approved of how the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> was dealing with the matter when it came up for interagency
                discussion at his level. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> told us, "I asked the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dale Watson</ENAMEX> . . . to
                handle that, to check to see if that was all right with them, to see if they wanted
                access to any of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, and to get back to me. And if they had no objections,
                it would be fine with me." <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> added,"I have no recollection of clearing it with
                anybody at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>."
            
            Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chief of Staff</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrew Card</ENAMEX> remembered someone telling him about
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Saudi</ENAMEX> request shortly after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9/11</TIMEX>, he said he had not talked to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saudis</ENAMEX> and
                did not ask anyone to do anything about it. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> told us
                they were not aware of the issue at all until it surfaced much later in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX>.
                None of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> we interviewed recalled any intervention or direction on this
                matter from any political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">appointee</ENAMEX>.
            
            <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, we believe that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> conducted a satisfactory screening of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Saudi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nationals</ENAMEX>
                who left the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> on charter flights.
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Saudi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> was advised of and agreed to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>'s requirements that
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> be identified and checked against various databases before the flights
                departed<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.29</NUMEX>The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Aviation Administration</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> working in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>
                operations <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> made sure that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> was aware of the flights of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Saudi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nationals</ENAMEX>
                and was able to screen the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> before they were allowed to depart.
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> interviewed all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> of interest on these flights prior to their
                departures. They concluded that none of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> was connected to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX>
                attacks and have since found no evidence to change that conclusion. Our own
                independent review of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Saudi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nationals</ENAMEX> involved confirms that no one with known
                links to terrorism departed on these flights.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLANNING</ENAMEX> FOR WAR
            By <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">late in the evening</TIMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 11</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> had addressed the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> on the
                terrible events of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheney</ENAMEX> described the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX>'s mood as
                somber<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.32</NUMEX>The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">long day</TIMEX> was not yet over. When the larger meeting that included his
                domestic department <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heads</ENAMEX> broke up, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> chaired a smaller meeting of top
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">advisers</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> he would later call his "war <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">council</ENAMEX>."33This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> usually
                included <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheney</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary of State</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Powell</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Rumsfeld</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">General</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hugh Shelton</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice Chairman</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joint Chiefs</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later</TIMEX> to
                become <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">General</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Myers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DCI Tenet</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Attorney General</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ashcroft</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Mueller</ENAMEX>. From the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Security Advisor</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Condoleezza Rice</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chief of Staff Card</ENAMEX> were part of the core <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, often joined
                by their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">deputies</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Hadley</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joshua Bolten</ENAMEX>.
            In this restricted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Security Council</ENAMEX> meeting, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> said it was a
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> for self-defense. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> would punish not just the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">perpetrators</ENAMEX> of
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">attacks</ENAMEX>, but also those who harbored them. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Powell</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX> had to make it clear to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> that the
                time to act was now. He said we would need to build a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">coalition</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> noted
                that the attacks provided a great opportunity to engage <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> urged the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principals</ENAMEX> to think broadly about who might
                have harbored the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attackers</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Libya</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sudan</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX>. He
                wondered aloud how much evidence the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> would need in order to deal with
                these <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>, pointing out that major strikes could take <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">up to 60 days</TIMEX> to
                    assemble.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> chaired <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> more meetings of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSC</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 12</TIMEX>. In the first
                meeting, he stressed that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> was at war with a new and different kind
                of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enemy</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> tasked <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principals</ENAMEX> to go beyond their pre-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX> work and
                develop a strategy to eliminate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX> and punish those who support them. As
                they worked on defining the goals and objectives of the upcoming campaign, they
                considered a paper that went beyond <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> to propose the "elimination of
                terrorism as a threat to our way of life," an aim that would include pursuing other
                international terrorist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Middle East</ENAMEX>.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rice</ENAMEX> chaired a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Principals Committee</ENAMEX> meeting on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 13</TIMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Situation Room</ENAMEX> to
                refine how the fight against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> would be conducted. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principals</ENAMEX> agreed that
                the overall message should be that anyone supporting <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> would risk harm. The
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX> would need to integrate diplomacy, financial measures, intelligence,
                and military actions into an overarching strategy. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principals</ENAMEX> also focused on
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> and what it could do to turn the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX> against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>. They concluded
                that if <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> decided not to help the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, it too would be at
                    risk.
            
            The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">same day</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Deputy Secretary of State</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Armitage</ENAMEX> met with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pakistani</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ambassador</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maleeha Lodhi</ENAMEX>, and the visiting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>'s
                military intelligence service, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mahmud Ahmed</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Armitage</ENAMEX> said that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>
                wanted <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> to take <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> steps:
            
                to stop <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX> at its border and end all logistical support for
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>;
                to give the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> blanket overflight and landing rights for all
                    necessary military and intelligence operations;
                to provide territorial access to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> and allied military intelligence and
                    other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> to conduct operations against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>;
                to provide the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> with intelligence information;
                to continue to publicly condemn the terrorist acts;
                to cut off all shipments of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fuel</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX> and stop <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recruits</ENAMEX> from going
                    to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>; and,
                if the evidence implicated bin <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ladin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX> continued to
                    harbor them, to break relations with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Taliban</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>.
                
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> made its decision swiftly. That <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary of State</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Powell</ENAMEX>
                announced at the beginning of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSC</ENAMEX> meeting that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pakistani</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Musharraf</ENAMEX> had
                agreed to every <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> request for support in the war on terrorism. The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next day</TIMEX>, the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">embassy</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Islamabad</ENAMEX> confirmed that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Musharraf</ENAMEX> and his top military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commanders</ENAMEX>
                had agreed to all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> demands." <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> will need full <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> support as it proceeds
                with us," the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">embassy</ENAMEX> noted." <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Musharraf</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GOP</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>] was
                making substantial concessions in allowing use of its <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">territory</ENAMEX> and that he would
                pay a domestic price. His standing in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> was certain to suffer. To
                counterbalance that he needed to show that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> was benefiting from his
                    decisions."
            
            At the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 13</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSC</ENAMEX> meeting, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Powell</ENAMEX> described <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>'s reply,
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> led a discussion of an appropriate ultimatum to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX>. He also
                ordered <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> to develop a military plan against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX>. The
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> wanted the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> to strike the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX>, step back, wait to see if
                they got the message, and hit them hard if they did not. He made clear that the
                military should focus on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> that would influence the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX>'s behavior.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> also tasked the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX>, which on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the following day</TIMEX> delivered
                to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> a paper titled <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">"Game</ENAMEX> Plan for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Political- Military Strategy</ENAMEX> for
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>." The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> took it as a given that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> would
                continue to act against the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> even while under <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Taliban</ENAMEX> control. It
                therefore detailed specific <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> demands for the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Taliban: surrender Bin Ladin and</ENAMEX>
                his chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lieutenants</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ayman al Zawahiri</ENAMEX>; tell the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> what the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX> knew about <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> and its operations; close all terrorist <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camps</ENAMEX>; free all
                imprisoned <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreigners</ENAMEX>; and comply with all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UN Security Council</ENAMEX> resolutions.
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX> proposed delivering an ultimatum to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX>: produce Bin
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ladin</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">deputies</ENAMEX> and shut down <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">camps</ENAMEX> within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 to 48 hours</TIMEX>, or the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX> will use all necessary means to destroy the terrorist infrastructure.
                The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX> did not expect the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX> to comply. Therefore, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State</ENAMEX> and
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense</ENAMEX> would plan to build an international <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">coalition</ENAMEX> to go into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>. Both
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">departments</ENAMEX> would consult with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">allies</ENAMEX> and request intelligence,
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">basing</ENAMEX>, and other support from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>, according to their capabilities and
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX>. Finally, the plan detailed a public <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> stance: <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> would use all
                its resources to eliminate terrorism as a threat, punish those responsible for the
                <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX> attacks, hold <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actors</ENAMEX> responsible for providing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">sanctuary</ENAMEX> to
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">terrorists</ENAMEX>, work with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">coalition</ENAMEX> to eliminate terrorist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX>, and
                avoid malice toward any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, religion, or culture.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> recalled that he quickly realized that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> would have
                to invade <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> with ground <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX>.
            
            But the early briefings to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> on military options
                were disappointing. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tommy Franks</ENAMEX>, the commanding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">general</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central Command</ENAMEX>
                (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CENTCOM</ENAMEX>), told us that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> was dissatisfied. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">military</ENAMEX>, Franks
                said, did not have an off-the-shelf plan to eliminate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> threat in
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>. The existing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Infinite Resolve</ENAMEX> options did not, in his view, amount to
                such a plan.
            
            All these diplomatic and military plans were reviewed over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the weekend</TIMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September</TIMEX>
                <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15-16</NUMEX>, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> convened his war <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">council</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Camp David</ENAMEX>.
            
            Present were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheney</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rice, Hadley</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Powell, Armitage, Rumsfeld</ENAMEX>,
                Ashcroft, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mueller</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tenet</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Deputy Secretary</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Wolfowitz</ENAMEX>, and Cofer
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Black</ENAMEX>, chief of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DCI</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Counterterrorist Center</ENAMEX>.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tenet</ENAMEX> described a plan for collecting intelligence and mounting covert operations. He
                proposed inserting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> to work with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Afghan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">warlords</ENAMEX> who would
                join the fight against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.46</NUMEX>These <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> would act jointly with the
                military's Special <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Operations</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> later praised this proposal,
                saying it had been a turning point in his thinking.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Shelton</ENAMEX> briefed the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principals</ENAMEX> on the preliminary plan for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> that
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">military</ENAMEX> had put together. It drew on the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Infinite Resolve</ENAMEX> "phased campaign"
                plan the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> had begun developing in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November 2000</TIMEX> as an addition to the strike
                options it had been refining since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>. But <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shelton</ENAMEX> added a new element-the
                possible significant use of ground <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX>- and that is where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>
                reportedly focused his attention.
            
            After hearing from his senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> discussed with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rice</ENAMEX> the
                contents of the directives he would issue to set all the plans into motion. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rice</ENAMEX>
                prepared a paper that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> then considered with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principals</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX>
                <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 17</TIMEX>. "The purpose of this meeting," he recalled saying,"is to
                assign tasks for the first wave of the war against terrorism. It starts <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>."
            
            In a written set of instructions slightly refined during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX> meeting,
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> charged <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ashcroft</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mueller</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tenet</ENAMEX> to develop a plan for homeland
                defense. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> directed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary of State</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Powell</ENAMEX> to deliver an ultimatum
                to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX> along the lines that his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> had originally proposed. The
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX> was also tasked to develop a plan to stabilize <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> and to be
                prepared to notify <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hostilities</ENAMEX> were
                    imminent.
            
            In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisers</ENAMEX> discussed new legal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> for covert action
                in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>, including the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>'s first <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Memorandum of Notification</ENAMEX> on
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>. Shortly thereafter, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> authorized broad new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> for
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> instructed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shelton</ENAMEX> to develop further the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Camp David</ENAMEX>
                military plan to attack the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX> rejected the
                ultimatum. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> also tasked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> to ensure that robust measures to
                protect <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> against terrorist attack were implemented
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">worldwide</ENAMEX>. Finally, he directed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul O'Neill</ENAMEX> to craft a plan to
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">target al Qaeda</ENAMEX>'s funding and seize its assets.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSC</ENAMEX> staff <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> had begun leading meetings on terrorist fund-raising by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September</TIMEX>
                    18.
            
            Also by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 18</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Powell</ENAMEX> had contacted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">58</TIMEX> of his foreign counterparts and
                received offers of general aid, search-and-rescue equipment and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX>, and
                medical assistance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">teams</ENAMEX>.
            
            On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the same day</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Deputy Secretary of State</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Armitage</ENAMEX> was called by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mahmud Ahmed</ENAMEX>
                regarding a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two-day</TIMEX> visit to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> during which the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pakistani</ENAMEX> intelligence
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> had met with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mullah Omar</ENAMEX> and conveyed the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> demands. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Omar</ENAMEX>'s response was
                "not negative on all these points." But the
                administration knew that theTaliban was unlikely to turn over <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>.
            
            The pre-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX> draft presidential directive on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> evolved into a new directive,
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Security Presidential Directive 9</ENAMEX>, now titled <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">"Defeating the Terrorist</ENAMEX>
                Threat to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>." The directive would now extend to a global war on
                terrorism, not just on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>. It also incorporated the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX>'s determination
                not to distinguish between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX> and those who harbor them. It included a
                determination to use military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> if necessary to end <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">sanctuary</ENAMEX> in
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>. The new directive-formally signed on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 25</TIMEX>, after the fighting in
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> had already begun-included new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">material</ENAMEX> followed by annexes discussing
                each targeted terrorist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. The old draft directive on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> became, in
                effect, the first annex.
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> would strive to eliminate all terrorist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX>, dry up their
                financial support, and prevent them from acquiring <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX> of mass destruction. The
                goal was the "elimination of terrorism as a threat to our way of life."
            
            "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">PHASE TWO" AND THE QUESTION OF IRAQ</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> had wondered immediately after the attack whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX>'s
                regime might have had a hand in it. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> had been an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enemy</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> for
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11 years</TIMEX>, and was the only place in the world where the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> was engaged in
                ongoing combat operations. As a former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> was struck by the
                apparent sophistication of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX> and some of the piloting, especially
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hanjour</ENAMEX>'s high-speed dive into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX>. He told us he recalled <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Iraqi</ENAMEX> support
                for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Palestinian</ENAMEX> suicide <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX> as well. Speculating about other possible states
                that could be involved, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> told us he also thought about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX>.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> has written that on <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the evening</TIMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 12</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> told him and
                some of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> to explore possible <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Iraqi</ENAMEX> links to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX>. "See if <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam</ENAMEX> did this,"
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> recalls the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> telling them." See if he's linked in any way." While he believed the details of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX>'s account to be
                incorrect, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> acknowledged that he might well have spoken to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> at
                some point, asking him about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX>.
            
            Responding to a presidential tasking, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> sent a memo to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rice</ENAMEX> on
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 18</TIMEX>, titled "Survey of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelligence Information</ENAMEX> on Any <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> Involvement in
                the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 11</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Attacks</ENAMEX>." <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rice</ENAMEX>'s chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staffer</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zalmay Khalilzad</ENAMEX>,
                concurred in its conclusion that only some anecdotal evidence linked <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qaeda</ENAMEX>. The memo found no "compelling case" that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> had either planned or
                perpetrated the attacks. It passed along a few foreign intelligence reports,
                including the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Czech</ENAMEX> report alleging an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 2001</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Prague</ENAMEX> meeting between <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> and an
                <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Iraqi</ENAMEX> intelligence <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> (discussed in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">chapter 7</ENAMEX>) and a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Polish</ENAMEX> report that
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Iraqi</ENAMEX> intelligence in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baghdad</ENAMEX> were told before
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 11</TIMEX> to go on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> to gauge <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX> reaction to an unspecified event.
                Arguing that the case for links between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> was weak, the memo pointed
                out that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> resented the secularism of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>. Finally, the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">memo</ENAMEX> said, there was no confirmed reporting on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Saddam</ENAMEX> cooperating with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> on
                unconventional <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX>.
            
            On the afternoon of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX>, according to contemporaneous notes, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX>
                instructed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">General</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Myers</ENAMEX> to obtain quickly as much information as possible. The
                notes indicate that he also told <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Myers</ENAMEX> that he was not simply interested in striking
                empty training <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX>. He thought the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> response should consider a wide range of
                options and possibilities. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX> said his instinct was to hit <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX>
                at the same time-not only <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> later explained that at the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>, he had been considering either one of them, or perhaps someone else, as the
                responsible <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX>.
            
            According to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rice</ENAMEX>, the issue of what, if anything, to do about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> was really
                engaged at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Camp David</ENAMEX>. Briefing papers on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX>, along with many others, were in
                briefing materials for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rice</ENAMEX> told us the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> was
                concerned that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> would take advantage of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX> attacks. She recalled that in
                the first <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Camp David</ENAMEX> session chaired by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> asked what the
                administration should do about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX>. Deputy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolfowitz</ENAMEX> made the case for
                striking <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> during "this round" of the war on terrorism.
            
            A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense Department</ENAMEX> paper for the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Camp David</ENAMEX> briefing book on the strategic concept
                for the war on terrorism specified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> priority targets for initial action: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al</ENAMEX>
                Qaeda, theTaliban, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX>. It argued that of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> posed a
                strategic threat to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX>'s long-standing involvement in terrorism
                was cited, along with its interest in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX> of mass destruction.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Powell</ENAMEX> recalled that Wolfowitz-not Rumsfeld-argued that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> was ultimately
                the source of the terrorist problem and should therefore be attacked.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Powell</ENAMEX> said that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolfowitz</ENAMEX> was not able to justify his belief that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> was behind
                <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX>. "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul</ENAMEX> was always of the view that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> was a problem that had to be dealt
                with," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Powell</ENAMEX> told us." And he saw this as one way of using this event as a way to
                deal with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> problem." <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Powell</ENAMEX> said that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> did not give
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wolfowitz</ENAMEX>'s argument "much weight." Though continuing to
                worry about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the following week</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Powell</ENAMEX> said, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> saw <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>
                as the priority.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> told <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Woodward</ENAMEX> that the decision not to invade <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> was made at the
                <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> session on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 15</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> was not even on the table during the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September</TIMEX>
                <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15 afternoon</TIMEX> session, which dealt solely with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rice</ENAMEX> said that when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> called her on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 16</TIMEX>, he said the
                focus would be on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>, although he still wanted plans for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> should the
                country take some action or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> eventually determine that it had been
                involved in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 9/11</TIMEX> attacks.
            
            At the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 17</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSC</ENAMEX> meeting, there was some further discussion of "phase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>" of
                the war on terrorism.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> ordered the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense Department</ENAMEX> to be ready to deal with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> if
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baghdad</ENAMEX> acted against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> interests, with plans to include possibly occupying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iraqi</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">fields</ENAMEX>.
            
            Within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Deputy Secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolfowitz</ENAMEX> continued to press the case for
                dealing with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX>. Writing to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 17</TIMEX> in a memo headlined
                "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Preventing More Events</ENAMEX>,"he argued that if there was even a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 percent</NUMEX> chance that
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX> was behind the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX> attack, maximum priority should be placed on
                eliminating that threat. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolfowitz</ENAMEX> contended that the odds were "far more" than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> in
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>, citing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam</ENAMEX>'s praise for the attack, his long record of involvement in
                terrorism, and theories that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ramzi Yousef</ENAMEX> was an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Iraqi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> was behind the
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX> attack on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Trade Center</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">73</TIMEX> The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next day</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wolfowitz</ENAMEX> renewed the
                argument, writing to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> about the interest of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yousef</ENAMEX> 's co-conspirator in the
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manila</ENAMEX> air plot in crashing an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">explosives</ENAMEX>-laden <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX>,
                and about information from a foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> regarding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iraqis</ENAMEX>' involvement in the
                attempted hijacking of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gulf Air</ENAMEX> flight. Given this background, he wondered why so
                little thought had been devoted to the danger of suicide <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX>, seeing a "failure
                of imagination" and a mind-set that dismissed possibilities.
            
            On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 19</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> offered several thoughts for his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commanders</ENAMEX> as they worked
                on their contingency plans. Though he emphasized the worldwide nature of the
                conflict, the references to specific <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enemies</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> named only the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al</ENAMEX>
                Qaeda, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shelton</ENAMEX> told us the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> reviewed all the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX>'s war plans and
                challenged certain assumptions underlying them, as any prudent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> or
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> should do.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tommy Franks</ENAMEX>, the commanding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">general</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central Command</ENAMEX>, recalled receiving
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX>'s guidance that each regional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commander</ENAMEX> should assess what these plans
                meant for his area of responsibility. He knew he would soon be striking the Taliban
                and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>. But, he told us, he now wondered how that action was
                connected to what might need to be done in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Somalia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX>.
            
            On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 20</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> met with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prime Minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tony Blair</ENAMEX>, and the
                <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> discussed the global conflict ahead. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blair</ENAMEX> asked about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX>, the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> replied that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> was not the immediate problem. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of his
                administration, he commented, had expressed a different view, but he was the one
                responsible for making the decisions.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Franks</ENAMEX> told us that he was pushing independently to do more robust planning on
                military responses in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX> before <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX>-a request <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>
                denied, arguing that the time was not right. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CENTCOM</ENAMEX> also began dusting off plans
                for a full invasion of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> during this period, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Franks</ENAMEX> said.) The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CENTCOM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commander</ENAMEX>
                told us he renewed his appeal for further military planning to respond to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iraqi</ENAMEX>
                moves shortly after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9/11</TIMEX>, both because he personally felt that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>
                might be engaged in some form of collusion and because he worried that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam</ENAMEX> might
                take advantage of the attacks to move against his internal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enemies</ENAMEX> in the northern
                or southern parts of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX>, where the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> was flying regular missions to
                enforce <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Iraqi</ENAMEX> no-fly zones. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Franks</ENAMEX> said that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> again turned down the
                    request.
            
            Having issued directives to guide his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>'s preparations for war, on
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 20</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> addressed the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> before a joint session
                of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>." <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Tonight</TIMEX>," he said, "we are a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> awakened to danger." The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> blamed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9/11</TIMEX> and the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">embassy</ENAMEX> bombings and, for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time, declared that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> was "responsible
                for bombing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">USS Cole</ENAMEX>." He reiterated the ultimatum
                that had already been conveyed privately." The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX> must act, and act
                immediately," he said." They will hand over the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX>, or they will share in
                their fate." The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> added that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>'s quarrel
                was not with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Islam</ENAMEX>: "The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enemy</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> is not our many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>; it is not
                our many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>. Our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enemy</ENAMEX> is a radical network of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX>, and every
                government that supports them." Other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regimes</ENAMEX> faced hard choices, he pointed out:
                "Every <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>, in every region, now has a decision to make: Either you are with us,
                or you are with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX>."
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> argued that the new war went beyond <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>." Our war on terror
                begins with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>, but it does not end there," he said." It will not end until
                every terrorist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of global reach has been found, stopped, and defeated." The
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> had a message for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX>:"The hour is coming when <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> will act,
                and you will make us proud." He also had a message for those outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX>." This is civilization's fight," he said. "We ask every <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> to join
                    us."
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> approved military plans to attack <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> in meetings with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Command</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Franks</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisers</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 21 and October 2</TIMEX>.
                Originally titled <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">"Infinite Justice</ENAMEX>," the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX>'s code word was changed-to avoid
                the sensibilities of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslims</ENAMEX> who associate the power of infinite <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">justice</ENAMEX> with God
                alone-to the operational name still used for operations in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Afghanistan:"Enduring</ENAMEX>
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Freedom</ENAMEX>."
            
            The plan had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> phases.
            
                In Phase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> and its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">allies</ENAMEX> would move forces into the
                    region and arrange to operate from or over neighboring <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> such as
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Uzbekistan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>. This occurred in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the weeks</TIMEX> following <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9/11</TIMEX>, aided by
                    overwhelming international sympathy for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>.
                In Phase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX>, air strikes and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Special Operations</ENAMEX> attacks would hit key <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al</ENAMEX>
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Qaeda and Taliban</ENAMEX> targets. In an innovative joint effort, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> and Special
                    Operations <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> would be deployed to work together with each major <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Afghan</ENAMEX>
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">faction</ENAMEX> opposed to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX>. The Phase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> strikes and raids began on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX>
                    <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>. The basing arrangements contemplated for Phase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> were substantially
                    secured-after arduous effort-by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of that month</TIMEX>.
                In Phase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> would carry out "decisive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX>" using
                    all elements of national power, including ground <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX>, to topple the Taliban
                    regime and eliminate <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">sanctuary</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mazar-e-Sharif</ENAMEX>, in
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">northern Afghanistan</ENAMEX>, fell to a coalition assault by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Afghan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> on
                    <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November 9</TIMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Four days later</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX> had fled from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kabul</ENAMEX>. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early December</TIMEX>,
                    all major <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> had fallen to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">coalition</ENAMEX>. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 22</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hamid Karzai</ENAMEX>, a
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pashtun</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kandahar</ENAMEX>, was installed as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>'s
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interim</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> had been liberated from the rule of the
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX>.
            
            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 2001</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Afghan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">forces</ENAMEX>, with limited <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> support, engaged <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> elements
                in a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cave complex</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tora Bora</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 2002</TIMEX>, the largest engagement of the war
                was fought, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">mountainous Shah-i-Kot</ENAMEX> area south of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gardez</ENAMEX>, against a large
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">force of al Qaeda</ENAMEX> jihadists. The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three-week</TIMEX> battle was substantially successful, and
                almost all remaining <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> took refuge in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>'s equally mountainous
                and lightly governed frontier <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">provinces</ENAMEX>. As of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 2004</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zawahiri</ENAMEX> are
                still believed to be at large.
            
                In Phase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilian</ENAMEX> and military <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> turned to the indefinite task
                    of what the armed forces call "security and stability operations."
            
            Within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about two months</TIMEX> of the start of combat operations, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several hundred</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>
