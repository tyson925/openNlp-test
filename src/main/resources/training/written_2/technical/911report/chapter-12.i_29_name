            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">REFLECTING</ENAMEX> ON A GENERATIONAL CHALLENGE
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Three years after 9/11</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> are still thinking and talking about how to protect
                our <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> in this new era. The national debate continues. Countering terrorism has
                become, beyond any doubt, the top national security priority for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>.
                This shift has occurred with the full support of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>, both major political
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parties</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>.
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> has committed enormous resources to national security and to countering
                terrorism. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Between fiscal year 2001</TIMEX>, the last budget adopted before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9/11</TIMEX>, and the
                present <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 2004</TIMEX>, total federal spending on defense (including expenditures
                on both <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">homeland</ENAMEX> security, and international affairs rose
                <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 50 percent</NUMEX>, from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$354 billion</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $547 billion</NUMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> has
                not experienced such a rapid surge in national security spending since the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Korean</ENAMEX>
                    War.
            
            This pattern has occurred before in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> history. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> faces a
                sudden crisis and summons a tremendous exertion of national energy. Then, as that
                surge transforms the landscape, comes a time for reflection and reevaluation. Some
                programs and even <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> are discarded; others are invented or redesigned. Private
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX> and engaged <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> redefine their relationships with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>, working
                through the processes of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">republic</ENAMEX>.
            Now is the time for that reflection and reevaluation. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> should
                consider what to do-the shape and objectives of a strategy. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> should also
                consider how to do it-organizing their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> in a different way. Defining the
                Threat In the post-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX> world, threats are defined more by the fault lines within
                societies than by the territorial boundaries between them. From terrorism to global
                <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> or environmental degradation, the challenges have become transnational
                rather than international. That is the defining quality of world politics in the
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty-first century</TIMEX>.
            National security used to be considered by studying foreign frontiers, weighing
                opposing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>, and measuring industrial might. To be dangerous, an enemy
                had to muster large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">armies</ENAMEX>. Threats emerged slowly, often visibly, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX> were
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">forged</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">armies conscripted</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> trained and moved into place. Because large
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> were more powerful, they also had more to lose. They could be deterred.
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Now</TIMEX> threats can emerge quickly. An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>, headquartered in a
                country on the other side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">earth</ENAMEX>, in a region so poor that electricity or
                telephones were scarce, could nonetheless scheme to wield <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX> of unprecedented
                destructive power in the largest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. In this sense, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX>
                has taught us that terrorism against <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> interests "over there" should be
                regarded just as we regard terrorism against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> "over here." In this same
                sense, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">homeland</ENAMEX> is the planet. But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enemy</ENAMEX> is not just "terrorism,"
                some generic evil.
            
            This vagueness blurs the strategy. The catastrophic threat at this moment in history
                is more specific. It is the threat posed by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Islamist</ENAMEX> terrorism-especially the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al</ENAMEX>
                Qaeda network, its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">affiliates</ENAMEX>, and its ideology.
            
            As we mentioned in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">chapter 2</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Usama Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Islamist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorist leaders</ENAMEX>
                draw on a long tradition of extreme intolerance within one stream of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Islam</ENAMEX> (a
                minority tradition), from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ibn Taimiyyah</ENAMEX>, through the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">founders</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wahhabism</ENAMEX>,
                through the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Muslim Brotherhood, to Sayyid Qutb</ENAMEX>. That stream is motivated by religion
                and does not distinguish politics from religion, thus distorting both. It is further
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fed</ENAMEX> by grievances stressed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> and widely felt throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX>
                world-against the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> military presence in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Middle East</ENAMEX>, policies perceived as
                anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-Muslim</ENAMEX>, and support of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Islamist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX>
                mean exactly what they say: to them <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> is the font of all evil, the "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of
                the snake," and it must be converted or destroyed.
            It is not a position with which <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> can bargain or negotiate. With it there is
                no common ground-not even respect for life-on which to begin a dialogue. It can only
                be destroyed or utterly isolated.
            Because the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX> world has fallen behind the West politically, economically, and
                militarily for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past three centuries</TIMEX>, and because few tolerant or secular <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX>
                democracies provide alternative models for the future, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>'s message finds
                receptive ears. It has attracted active support from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of disaffected young
                <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslims</ENAMEX> and resonates powerfully with a far larger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">number</ENAMEX> who do not actively
                support his methods. The resentment of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> and the West is deep, even among
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> of relatively successful <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tolerance</ENAMEX>, the rule of law, political and economic openness, the extension of greater
                opportunities to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>-these cures must come from within <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX> societies
                themselves. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> must support such developments. But this process is
                likely to be measured in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX>, not <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>. It is a process that will be violently
                opposed by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Islamist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorist organizations</ENAMEX>, both inside <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> and in
                attacks on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> and other Western <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nations</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> finds
                itself caught up in a clash within a civilization. That clash arises from particular
                conditions in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX> world, conditions that spill over into expatriate <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> in non-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>. Our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enemy</ENAMEX> is twofold: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>, a stateless
                network of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX> that struck us on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX>; and a radical ideological movement in
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Islamic</ENAMEX> world, inspired in part by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>, which has spawned terrorist groups
                and violence across the globe. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enemy</ENAMEX> is weakened, but continues to pose a
                grave threat. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enemy</ENAMEX> is gathering, and will menace <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
                interests long after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Usama Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cohorts</ENAMEX> are killed or captured. Thus
                our strategy must match our means to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> ends: dismantling the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> and
                prevailing in the longer term over the ideology that gives rise to Islamist
                terrorism.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Islam</ENAMEX> is not the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enemy</ENAMEX>. It is not synonymous with terror. Nor does Islam teach
                terror. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> and its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> oppose a perversion of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Islam</ENAMEX>, not the great world
                faith itself. Lives guided by religious faith, including literal beliefs in holy
                scriptures, are common to every religion, and represent no threat to us. Other
                religions have experienced violent internal struggles. With so many diverse
                adherents, every major religion will spawn violent zealots. Yet understanding and
                tolerance among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> of different faiths can and must prevail. The present
                transnational danger is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Islamist</ENAMEX> terrorism. What is needed is a broad
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">political-military</ENAMEX> strategy that rests on a firm tripod of policies to
            
                attack <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX> and their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>;
                prevent the continued growth of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Islamist</ENAMEX> terrorism; and
                protect against and prepare for terrorist attacks.
            
            More Than a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">War on Terrorism</ENAMEX>
            Terrorism is a tactic used by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> to kill and destroy. Our
                efforts should be directed at those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>. Calling this
                struggle a war accurately describes the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> and allied armed forces to
                find and destroy terrorist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> and their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">allies</ENAMEX> in the field, notably in
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>. The language of war also evokes the mobilization for a national effort.
                Yet the strategy should be balanced.
            The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> phase of our post-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX> efforts rightly included military action to topple
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pursue al Qaeda</ENAMEX>. This work continues. But long-term success demands
                the use of all elements of national power: diplomacy, intelligence, covert action,
                law enforcement, economic policy, foreign aid, public diplomacy, and homeland
                defense. If we favor one tool while neglecting others, we leave ourselves vulnerable
                and weaken our national effort.
            Certainly the strategy should include offensive operations to counter terrorism.
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Terrorists</ENAMEX> should no longer find safe haven where their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> can grow and
                flourish. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>'s strategy should be a coalition strategy, that includes <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nations</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> in its development and implementation. Our effort should be
                accompanied by a preventive strategy that is as much, or more, political as it is
                military. The strategy must focus clearly on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX> world, in all its
                variety.
            Our strategy should also include <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">defenses</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> can be attacked in many ways and
                has many vulnerabilities. No defenses are perfect. But risks must be calculated;
                hard choices must be made about allocating resources. Responsibilities for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>'s
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">defense</ENAMEX> should be clearly defined. Planning does make a difference, identifying
                where a little money might have a large effect. Defenses also complicate the plans
                of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attackers</ENAMEX>, increasing their risks of discovery and failure. Finally, the nation
                must prepare to deal with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">attacks</ENAMEX> that are not stopped.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Measuring Success</ENAMEX>
            What should <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> expect from their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> in the struggle against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Islamist</ENAMEX>
                terrorism? The goals seem unlimited: Defeat terrorism anywhere in the world. But
                <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> have also been told to expect the worst: An attack is probably coming; it
                may be terrible.
            With such benchmarks, the justifications for action and spending seem limitless.
                Goals are good. Yet effective public policies also need concrete objectives.
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Agencies</ENAMEX> need to be able to measure success.
            These measurements do not need to be quantitative: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> cannot measure success
                in the ways that private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX> can. But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> should be specific enough so
                that reasonable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observers</ENAMEX>-in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX>, or the
                general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX>-can judge whether or not the objectives have been attained.
            Vague goals match an amorphous picture of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enemy</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Qaeda</ENAMEX> and its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">affiliates</ENAMEX> are
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">popularly</ENAMEX> described as being all over the world, adaptable, resilient, needing
                little higher-level <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>, and capable of anything. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are
                thus given the picture of an omnipotent, unslayable hydra of destruction. This image
                lowers expectations for government effectiveness. It should not lower them too far.
                Our report shows a determined and capable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">plotters</ENAMEX>. Yet the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> was
                fragile, dependent on a few key <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personalities</ENAMEX>, and occasionally left vulnerable by
                the marginal, unstable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> often attracted to such causes. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enemy</ENAMEX> made
                mistakes-like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Khalid al Mihdhar</ENAMEX>'s unauthorized departure from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> that
                required him to enter the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> again in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 2001</TIMEX>, or the selection of Zacarias
                Moussaoui as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participant</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ramzi Binalshibh</ENAMEX>'s transfer of money to him. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
                government was not able to capitalize on those mistakes in time to prevent <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX>. We
                do not believe it is possible to defeat all terrorist attacks against <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>,
                every time and everywhere. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> should tell the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>:
            
                No <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> can promise that a catastrophic attack like that of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX> will not
                    happen again. History has shown that even the most vigilant and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert agencies</ENAMEX>
                    cannot always prevent determined, suicidal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attackers</ENAMEX> from reaching a target.
                But the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are entitled to expect their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> to do its very
                    best. They should expect that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> will have realistic objectives, clear
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">guidance</ENAMEX>, and effective <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>. They are entitled to see some standards
                    for performance so they can <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX>, with the help of their elected
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX>, whether the objectives are being met.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ATTACK TERRORISTS AND THEIR ORGANIZATIONS</ENAMEX>
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>, joined by other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> around the world, is working through
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intelligence</ENAMEX>, law enforcement, military, financial, and diplomatic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> to
                identify, disrupt, capture, or kill individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX>. This effort was going on
                before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9/11</TIMEX> and it continues on a vastly enlarged scale. But to catch <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX>, a
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> or foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> needs to be able to find and reach them.
            No Sanctuaries
            The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX> attack was a complex international <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX>, the product of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> of
                planning. Bombings like those in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bali</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX>, while able to take
                <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of lives, can be mounted locally. Their requirements are far more modest in
                size and complexity. They are more difficult to thwart. But the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> must
                build the capacities to prevent a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX>-scale plot from succeeding, and those
                capabilities will help greatly to cope with lesser but still devastating attacks.
            A complex international terrorist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX> aimed at launching a catastrophic attack
                cannot be mounted by just anyone in any place. Such <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> appear to require
            
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>, space, and ability to perform competent planning and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> work;
                a command structure able to make necessary decisions and possessing the
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">authority</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contacts</ENAMEX> to assemble needed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, money, and materials;
                opportunity and space to recruit, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX>, and select <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX> with the needed
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">skills</ENAMEX> and dedication, providing the time and structure required to socialize
                    them into the terrorist cause, judge their trustworthiness, and hone their
                    skills;
                a logistics network able to securely manage the travel of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX>, move
                    money, and transport resources (like <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">explosives</ENAMEX>) where they need to go;
                access, in the case of certain <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX>, to the special <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">materials</ENAMEX> needed for a
                    nuclear, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemical</ENAMEX>, radiological, or biological attack;
                reliable communications between coordinators and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX>; and
                opportunity to test the workability of the plan.
            
            Many details in chapters <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2, 5</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> illustrate the direct and indirect value of the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Afghan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">sanctuary</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> in preparing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 9/11</TIMEX> attack and other operations. The
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX> cemented personal ties among veteran <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">jihadists</ENAMEX> working together there
                for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>. It had the operational space to gather and sift <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recruits</ENAMEX>, indoctrinating
                them in isolated, desert <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camps</ENAMEX>. It built up logistical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX>, running through
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United Arab Emirates</ENAMEX>.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Qaeda</ENAMEX> also exploited relatively lax internal security environments in Western
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>, especially <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>. It considered the environment in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> so
                hospitable that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX> used <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> as their staging area for further
                training and exercises-traveling into, out of, and around the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> and
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">complacently</ENAMEX> using their real names with little fear of capture. To find <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">sanctuary</ENAMEX>,
                terrorist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> have fled to some of the least governed, most lawless places
                in the world. The intelligence <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> has prepared a world map that highlights
                possible terrorist <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">havens</ENAMEX>, using no secret intelligence-just indicating areas that
                combine rugged terrain, weak governance, room to hide or receive supplies, and low
                population density with a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">town</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> near enough to allow necessary interaction
                with the outside world. Large areas scattered around the world meet these
                    criteria.
            
            In talking with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> and foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> and military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> on
                the front lines fighting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, we asked them: If you were a terrorist
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> today, where would you locate your <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base</ENAMEX>? Some of the same places come up
                again and again on their lists:
            
                western <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> border region
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">southern</ENAMEX> or western <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Arabian Peninsula</ENAMEX>, especially <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX>, and the nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Horn</ENAMEX>
                    of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Somalia</ENAMEX> and extending southwest into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kenya</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Southeast</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX>, from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Thailand</ENAMEX> to the southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philippines</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indonesia</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Africa</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nigeria</ENAMEX> and Mali
                <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">European</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> with expatriate <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX>, especially <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> in
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">central</ENAMEX> and eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> where security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> and border controls are less
                    effective
            
            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the twentieth century</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">strategists</ENAMEX> focused on the world's great industrial
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heartlands</ENAMEX>. In the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty-first</TIMEX>, the focus is in the opposite direction, toward
                remote regions and failing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> has had to find ways to extend
                its reach, straining the limits of its influence.
            Every policy decision we make needs to be seen through this lens. If, for example,
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> becomes a failed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, it will go to the top of the list of places that are
                breeding grounds for attacks against <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> at home. Similarly, if we are paying
                insufficient attention to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>, the rule of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">warlords</ENAMEX> and
                narcotraffickers may reemerge and its countryside could once again offer refuge to
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>, or its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">successor</ENAMEX>.
            
                Recommendation: The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> must identify and prioritize
                    actual or potential terrorist sanctuaries. For each, it should have a realistic
                    strategy to keep possible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX> insecure and on the run, using all elements
                    of national power. We should reach out, listen to, and work with other countries
                    that can help.
            
            We offer <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> illustrations that are particularly applicable <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX>:
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX>.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>'s endemic poverty, widespread corruption, and often ineffective government
                create opportunities for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Islamist</ENAMEX> recruitment. Poor education is a particular
                concern. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Millions</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>, especially those with little money, send their
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> to religious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>, or madrassahs. Many of these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> are the only
                opportunity available for an education, but some have been used as incubators for
                violent extremism. According to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Karachi</ENAMEX>'s police <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commander</ENAMEX>, there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">859</NUMEX> madrassahs
                teaching <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 200,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youngsters</ENAMEX> in his <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> alone.
            
            It is hard to overstate the importance of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> in the struggle against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Islamist</ENAMEX>
                terrorism. Within <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>'s borders are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">150 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslims</ENAMEX>, scores of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">terrorists</ENAMEX>, many <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Taliban</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">fighters</ENAMEX>, and-perhaps-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Usama Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> possesses
                nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX> and has come frighteningly close to war with nuclear-armed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>
                over the disputed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">territory</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kashmir</ENAMEX>. A political battle among <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-American</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Islamic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fundamentalists</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pakistani</ENAMEX> military, and more moderate mainstream
                political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> has already spilled over into violence, and there have been
                repeated recent attempts to kill <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pervez Musharraf</ENAMEX>.
            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> has had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> basic problems in its relationship
                with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>:
            
                On terrorism, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> helped nurture theTaliban. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pakistani</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX> and
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intelligence</ENAMEX> services, especially below the top <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ranks</ENAMEX>, have long been ambivalent
                    about confronting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Islamist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">extremists</ENAMEX>. Many in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> have sympathized
                    with or provided support to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">extremists</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Musharraf</ENAMEX> agreed that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> was
                    bad. But before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9/11</TIMEX>, preserving good relations with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX> took
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">precedence</ENAMEX>.
                On proliferation, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Musharraf</ENAMEX> has repeatedly said that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> does not barter
                    with its nuclear technology. But proliferation <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concerns</ENAMEX> have been long-standing
                    and very serious. Most recently, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pakistani</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> has claimed not to
                    have known that one of its nuclear weapons <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">developers</ENAMEX>, a national figure, was
                    leading the most dangerous nuclear smuggling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ring</ENAMEX> ever disclosed.
                Finally, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> has made little progress toward the return of democratic
                    rule at the national level, although that turbulent process does continue to
                    function at the provincial level and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pakistani</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">press</ENAMEX> remains relatively
                    free.
            
            Immediately after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9/11</TIMEX>, confronted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> with a stark choice, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>
                made a strategic decision. Its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> stood aside and allowed the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>-led
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coalition</ENAMEX> to destroy theTaliban <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>. In other ways, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> actively assisted:
                its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> arrested <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 500</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>, and
                <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pakistani</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> played a leading part in tracking down <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abu Zubaydah</ENAMEX>, and other
                key <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> figures.
            
            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the following two years</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pakistani</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> tried to walk the fence, helping
                against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> while seeking to avoid a larger confrontation withTaliban remnants
                and other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Islamic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">extremists</ENAMEX>. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> and its <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pakistani</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">allies</ENAMEX> repeatedly
                tried to assassinate <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Musharraf</ENAMEX>, almost succeeding, the battle came home.
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>'s vast unpoliced regions make <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> attractive to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">extremists</ENAMEX> seeking
                refuge and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recruits</ENAMEX> and also provide a base for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">coalition</ENAMEX> forces
                in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>. Almost all the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attackers</ENAMEX> traveled the northsouth nexus of
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kandahar</ENAMEX>-Quetta-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Karachi</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Baluchistan</ENAMEX> region of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX>'s ethnic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX>) and
                the sprawling <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Karachi</ENAMEX> remain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Islamist</ENAMEX> extremism where the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
                and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pakistani</ENAMEX> security and intelligence presence has been weak. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> consulate
                in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Karachi</ENAMEX> is a makeshift fortress, reflecting the gravity of the surrounding
                    threat.
            
            During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the winter of 2003-2004</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Musharraf</ENAMEX> made another strategic decision. He ordered
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pakistani</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX> into the frontier <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">provinces</ENAMEX> of northwest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> along the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Afghan</ENAMEX> border, where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ayman al Zawahiri</ENAMEX> have reportedly taken refuge.
                The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX> is confronting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fighters</ENAMEX> and their local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">allies</ENAMEX> in very
                difficult terrain. On the other side of the frontier, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>
                have found it challenging to organize effective joint <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX>, given <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>'s
                limited capabilities and reluctance to permit <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> military operations on its soil.
                Yet in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX>, it is clear that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pakistani</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> is trying harder than ever
                before in the battle against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Islamist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX>.
            
            Acknowledging these problems and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Musharraf</ENAMEX> 's own part in the story, we believe that
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Musharraf</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> represents the best hope for stability in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> and
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>.
            
                In an extraordinary public essay asking how <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslims</ENAMEX> can "drag ourselves out of
                    the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pit</ENAMEX> we find ourselves in, to raise ourselves up," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Musharraf</ENAMEX> has called for a
                    strategy of "enlightened moderation." The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX> world, he said, should shun
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">militancy</ENAMEX> and extremism; the West-and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> in particular-should
                    seek to resolve disputes with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">justice</ENAMEX> and help better the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX> world.
                
                Having come close to war in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002 and 2003</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> have recently
                    made significant progress in peacefully discussing their longstanding
                    differences. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> has been and should remain a key <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">supporter</ENAMEX> of
                    that process.
                The constant refrain of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pakistanis</ENAMEX> is that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> long treated them
                    as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">allies</ENAMEX> of convenience. As the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> makes fresh commitments now, it
                    should make promises it is prepared to keep, for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> to come.
            
            
                Recommendation: If <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Musharraf</ENAMEX> stands for enlightened moderation in a
                    fight for his life and for the life of his <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> should be
                    willing to make hard choices too, and make the difficult long-term commitment to
                    the future of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>. Sustaining the current scale of aid to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>, the
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX> should support <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> in its struggle against
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">extremists</ENAMEX> with a comprehensive effort that extends from military aid to support
                    for better education, so long as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> remain willing to make
                    difficult choices of their own.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">incubator</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> and for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 9/11</TIMEX> attacks. In the fall of
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>-led international <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">coalition</ENAMEX> and its <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Afghan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">allies</ENAMEX> toppled the Taliban
                and ended the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>'s protection of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>. Notable progress has been made.
                International cooperation has been strong, with a clear <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UN</ENAMEX> mandate and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX>-led
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peacekeeping force</ENAMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Security Assistance Force</ENAMEX>, or ISAF). More than
                <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX> are deployed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>, joined by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX> from
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">allies</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>. A central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> has been established in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kabul</ENAMEX>,
                with a democratic constitution, new currency, and a new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX>. Most <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Afghans</ENAMEX> enjoy
                greater freedom, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girls</ENAMEX> are emerging from subjugation, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 million</NUMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> have returned to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>. For the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many years</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Afghans</ENAMEX> have
                reason to hope.
            
            But grave challenges remain. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fighters</ENAMEX> have regrouped in the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">south</ENAMEX> and southeast. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Warlords</ENAMEX> control much of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> beyond <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kabul</ENAMEX>, and the land
                is awash in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX>. Economic development remains a distant hope. The narcotics
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trade</ENAMEX>-long a massive sector of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Afghan</ENAMEX> economy- is again booming. Even the most
                hardened aid <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> refuse to operate in many regions, and some warn that
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> is near the brink of chaos.
            
            Battered <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> has a chance. Elections are being prepared. It is revealing that
                in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 2004</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Taliban</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">fighters</ENAMEX> resorted to slaughtering <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Afghans</ENAMEX> on a bus,
                apparently for no reason other than their boldness in carrying an unprecedented
                <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Afghan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapon</ENAMEX>: a voter registration card.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hamid Karzai</ENAMEX>, is brave and committed. He is trying to build
                genuinely national <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX> that can overcome the tradition of allocating powers
                among ethnic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX>. Yet even if his efforts are successful and elections bring
                a democratic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> faces some difficult
                choices.
            After paying relatively little attention to rebuilding <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> during the
                military campaign, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> policies changed noticeably during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>. Greater
                consideration of the political dimension and congressional support for a substantial
                package of assistance signaled a longer-term commitment to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>'s future. One
                <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Afghan</ENAMEX> regional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> plaintively told us the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> finally has a good
                government. He begged the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> to keep its promise and not abandon
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> again, as it had in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1990s</TIMEX>. Another <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Afghan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> noted that if the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX> leaves, "we will lose all that we have gained."
            
            Most difficult is to define the security mission in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>. There is continuing
                political controversy about whether military operations in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> have had any effect
                on the scale of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>'s commitment to the future of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>
                has largely stayed out of the central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s struggles with dissident <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">warlords</ENAMEX>
                and it has largely avoided confronting the related problem of narcotrafficking.
            
            
                Recommendation: The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> deserve praise for
                    their efforts in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> so far. Now the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> and the international
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">community</ENAMEX> should make a long-term commitment to a secure and stable <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>,
                    in order to give the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> a reasonable opportunity to improve the life of
                    the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Afghan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> must not again become a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">sanctuary</ENAMEX> for
                    international crime and terrorism. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> and the international
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">community</ENAMEX> should help the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Afghan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> extend its authority over the
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, with a strategy and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>-by-nation commitments to achieve their
                    objectives.
            
            
                This is an ambitious recommendation. It would mean a redoubled effort to
                    secure the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, disarm <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">militias</ENAMEX>, and curtail the age of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">warlord</ENAMEX> rule. But
                    the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX> have already committed themselves to the future of
                    this region-wisely, as the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX> story shows-and failed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-measures could be
                    worse than useless.
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX> in particular has made <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> a test of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alliance</ENAMEX>'s ability to
                    adapt to current security challenges of the future. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX> must pass this test.
                    Currently, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> and the international community envision enough
                    support so that the central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> can build a truly national <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX> and
                    extend essential infrastructure and minimum public services to major <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> and
                    regions. The effort relies in part on foreign civil-military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX>, arranged
                    under various national flags. The institutional commitments of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX> and the
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Nations</ENAMEX> to these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enterprises</ENAMEX> are weak. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX> member <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> are not
                    following through; some of the other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> around the world that have pledged
                    assistance to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> are not fulfilling their pledges.
                The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> presence in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> is overwhelmingly oriented toward military
                    and security work. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX> presence is woefully understaffed, and
                    the military mission is narrowly focused on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> andTaliban remnants in the
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">south</ENAMEX> and southeast. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> can do its part if the international
                    community decides on a joint effort to restore the rule of law and contain
                    rampant crime and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">narcotics</ENAMEX> trafficking in this crossroads of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Central Asia</ENAMEX>.
                
            
            We heard again and again that the money for assistance is allocated so rigidly that,
                on the ground, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> often cannot improvise or pitch in to help another
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agency</ENAMEX>, even in small ways when <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a few thousand dollars</NUMEX> could make a great
                difference.
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> should allocate money so that lower-level <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> have more
                flexibility to get the job done across <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> lines, adjusting to the circumstances
                they find in the field. This should include discretionary funds for expenditures by
                military <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> that often encounter opportunities to help the local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX> has been a problematic ally in combating <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Islamic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">extremism</ENAMEX>. At the level
                of high policy, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> cooperated with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> diplomatic
                initiatives aimed at theTaliban or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9/11</TIMEX>. At the same time, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saudi</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arabia</ENAMEX>'s society was a place where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> raised money directly from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>
                and through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">charities</ENAMEX>. It was the society that produced <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> hijackers.
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kingdom</ENAMEX> is one of the world's most religiously conservative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">societies</ENAMEX>, and its
                identity is closely bound to its religious links, especially its position as the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">guardian</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Islam</ENAMEX>'s two holiest sites. Charitable giving, or zakat, is one of the
                <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> pillars of Islam. It is broader and more pervasive than Western ideas of
                charity- functioning also as a form of income tax, educational assistance, foreign
                aid, and a source of political influence. The Western notion of the separation of
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">civic</ENAMEX> and religious duty does not exist in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Islamic</ENAMEX> cultures. Funding charitable
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">works is an integral</ENAMEX> function of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Islamic</ENAMEX> world. It is so
                ingrained in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Islamic</ENAMEX> culture that in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX>, for example, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> within
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saudi Ministry of Finance</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Economy</ENAMEX> collects zakat directly, much as
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Internal Revenue Service</ENAMEX> collects payroll withholding tax. Closely tied to
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">zakat</ENAMEX> is the dedication of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> to propagating the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Islamic</ENAMEX> faith,
                particularly the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wahhabi</ENAMEX> sect that flourishes in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX>.
            Traditionally, throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX> world, there is no formal oversight mechanism
                for donations. As <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Saudi</ENAMEX> wealth increased, the amounts contributed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> and
                the state grew dramatically. Substantial sums went to finance <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Islamic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">charities</ENAMEX> of
                every kind.
            While <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Saudi</ENAMEX> domestic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">charities</ENAMEX> are regulated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ministry of Labor and Social</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Welfare</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">charities</ENAMEX> and international relief <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>, such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Assembly</ENAMEX> of
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Muslim Youth</ENAMEX> (WAMY), are currently regulated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ministry of Islamic Affairs</ENAMEX>.
                This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ministry</ENAMEX> uses zakat and government funds to spread Wahhabi beliefs throughout
                the world, including in mosques and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>. Often these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> provide the only
                education available; even in affluent <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Saudi</ENAMEX>-funded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wahhabi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> are
                often the only <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Islamic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Wahhabi</ENAMEX>-funded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> have been
                exploited by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">extremists</ENAMEX> to further their goal of violent jihad against non-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslims</ENAMEX>.
                One such <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> has been the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Haramain Islamic Foundation</ENAMEX>; the assets of
                some branch <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> have been frozen by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Saudi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX>.
            Until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9/11</TIMEX>, few <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Saudis</ENAMEX> would have considered government oversight of charitable
                donations necessary; many would have perceived it as interference in the exercise of
                their faith. At the same time, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s ability to finance most state
                expenditures with energy revenues has delayed the need for a modern income tax
                system. As a result, there have been strong religious, cultural, and administrative
                barriers to monitoring charitable spending. That appears to be changing, however,
                now that the goal of violent jihad also extends to overthrowing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sunni</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX>
                (such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House of Saud</ENAMEX>) that are not living up to the ideals of the Islamist
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">extremists</ENAMEX>.
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rulers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX> have long had
                friendly relations, rooted in fundamentally common interests against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Soviet</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Union</ENAMEX> during the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Cold War</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX> hopes that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Saudi</ENAMEX> oil supplies would stabilize
                the supply and price of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX> in world markets, and in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Saudi</ENAMEX> hopes that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> could
                help protect the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kingdom</ENAMEX> against foreign threats. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kingdom</ENAMEX> hosted <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
                armed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> before the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>-led war WHAT TO DO? A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GLOBAL STRATEGY</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">373</NUMEX> against
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">airmen</ENAMEX> have given their lives to help protect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saudi</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arabia</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Saudi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> has difficulty acknowledging this. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> military
                bases remained there until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>, as part of an international commitment to contain
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX>.
            For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many years</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> on both sides preferred to keep their ties quiet and behind
                the scenes. As a result, neither the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> nor the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Saudi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> appreciated all the
                dimensions of the bilateral relationship, including the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Saudi</ENAMEX> role in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
                strategies to promote the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Middle East</ENAMEX> peace process. In each <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, political
                figures find it difficult to publicly defend good relations with the other. Today,
                mutual recriminations flow. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> see <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX> as an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enemy</ENAMEX>, not as an
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">embattled</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ally</ENAMEX>. They perceive an autocratic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> that oppresses <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>,
                dominated by a wealthy and indolent elite. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Saudi</ENAMEX> contacts with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">politicians</ENAMEX>
                are frequently invoked as accusations in partisan political arguments. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> are
                often appalled by the intolerance, anti-Semitism, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-American</ENAMEX> arguments taught
                in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> and preached in mosques. Saudis are angry too. Many educated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Saudis</ENAMEX> who
                were sympathetic to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> now perceive the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> as an unfriendly <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>.
                <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Saudi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reformer</ENAMEX> noted to us that the demonization of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">media</ENAMEX> gives ammunition to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">radicals</ENAMEX>, who accuse <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reformers</ENAMEX> of being <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">lackeys</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Tens</ENAMEX>
                of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saudis</ENAMEX> who once regularly traveled to (and often had <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">homes</ENAMEX> in) the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX> now go elsewhere.
            
            Among <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saudis</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> is seen as aligned with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> in its conflict with
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Palestinians</ENAMEX>, with whom <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saudis</ENAMEX> ardently sympathize. Although <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX>'s
                cooperation against terrorism improved to some extent after the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 11</TIMEX>
                attacks, significant problems remained. Many in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kingdom</ENAMEX> initially reacted with
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">disbelief</ENAMEX> and denial. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the following months</TIMEX>, as the truth became clear, some
                leading <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Saudis</ENAMEX> quietly acknowledged the problem but still did not see their own
                regime as threatened, and thus often did not respond promptly to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> requests for
                help. Though <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX> was widely detested, many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Saudis</ENAMEX> are sympathetic to the
                anti-U.S. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">insurgents</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX>, although majorities also condemn jihadist attacks in
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kingdom</ENAMEX>.
            
            As in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX>, and other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>, attitudes changed when the terrorism came
                <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cooperation</ENAMEX> had already become significant, but after the bombings in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Riyadh</ENAMEX>
                on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 12, 2003</TIMEX>, it improved much more. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kingdom</ENAMEX> openly discussed the problem of
                radicalism, criticized the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX> as religiously deviant, reduced official
                support for religious activity overseas, closed suspect charitable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">foundations</ENAMEX>, and
                publicized arrests-very public moves for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> that has preferred to keep
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">internal</ENAMEX> problems quiet. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kingdom of Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX> is now locked in mortal combat
                with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Saudi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> are regularly being killed in shootouts with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX>.
                In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 2004</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Saudi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ambassador</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> called publicly-in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saudi</ENAMEX>
                press-for his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> to wage a jihad of its own against the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX>." We must
                all, as a state and as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, recognize the truth about these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">criminals</ENAMEX>," he
                declared, "[i]f we do not declare a general mobilization-we will lose this war on
                    terrorism."
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX> is a troubled <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. Although regarded as very wealthy, in fact per
                capita income has dropped from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$28,000</NUMEX> at its height to the present level of about
                <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$8,000</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social</ENAMEX> and religious traditions complicate adjustment to modern economic
                activity and limit employment opportunities for young <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saudis</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Women</ENAMEX> find their
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">education</ENAMEX> and employment sharply limited. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> offered us a perceptive
                analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX>, contending that fundamentally friendly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rulers</ENAMEX> have been
                constrained by their desire to preserve the status quo. He, like others, made the
                case for pragmatic reform instead. He hopes the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rulers</ENAMEX> will envision what they want
                their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kingdom</ENAMEX> to become in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 or 20 years</TIMEX>, and start a process in which their
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> can help them change.
            
            There are signs that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX>'s royal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> is trying to build a consensus for
                political reform, though uncertain about how fast and how far to go. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crown Prince</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abdullah</ENAMEX> wants the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kingdom</ENAMEX> to join the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Trade Organization</ENAMEX> to accelerate
                economic liberalization. He has embraced the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arab Human Development Report</ENAMEX>, which
                was highly critical of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> world's political, economic, and social failings and
                called for greater economic and political reform.
            
            Cooperation with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX> against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Islamist</ENAMEX> terrorism is very much in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
                interest. Such cooperation can exist for a time largely in secret, as it does now,
                but it cannot grow and thrive there. Nor, on either side, can friendship be
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">unconditional</ENAMEX>.
            
                Recommendation: The problems in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Saudi</ENAMEX> relationship must be
                    confronted, openly. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX> must determine if they
                    can build a relationship that political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> on both sides are prepared to
                    publicly defend-a relationship about more than <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oil</ENAMEX>. It should include a shared
                    commitment to political and economic reform, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Saudis</ENAMEX> make common cause with
                    the outside world. It should include a shared interest in greater tolerance and
                    cultural respect, translating into a commitment to fight the violent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">extremists</ENAMEX>
                    who foment hatred.
            
            PREVENT THE CONTINUED GROWTH OF ISLAMIST TERRORISM
            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 2003</TIMEX>, reflecting on progress after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</TIMEX> of waging the global war on
                terrorism, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> asked his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisers</ENAMEX>:"Are we capturing,
                killing or deterring and dissuading more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX> than the madrassas and
                the radical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clerics</ENAMEX> are recruiting, training and deploying against us? Does the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US</ENAMEX>
                need to fashion a broad, integrated plan to stop the next generation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX>?
                The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> is putting relatively little effort into a long-range plan, but we are
                putting a great deal of effort into trying to stop <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX>. The cost-benefit
                ratio is against us! Our cost is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">billions</NUMEX> against the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX>' costs of
                    <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX>."
            
            These are the right questions. Our answer is that we need short-term action on a
                long-range strategy, one that invigorates our foreign policy with the attention that
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> have given to the military and intelligence parts of the
                conflict against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Islamist</ENAMEX> terrorism.
            Engage the Struggle of Ideas
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> is heavily engaged in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX> world and will be for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many years</TIMEX>
                to come. This <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> engagement is resented. Polls in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX> found that among
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>, like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX>-the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipient</ENAMEX> of more <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> aid for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past 20 years</TIMEX>
                than any other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX> country-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 15 percent</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> had a favorable
                opinion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX> the number was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12 percent</NUMEX>. And
                <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two-thirds</NUMEX> of those surveyed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indonesia</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Turkey</ENAMEX> (a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ally</ENAMEX>) were very or somewhat fearful that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> may attack them.
            
            Support for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> has plummeted. Polls taken in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Islamic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> after
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">9/11</ENAMEX> suggested that many or most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> thought the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> was doing the
                right thing in its fight against terrorism; few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> saw popular support for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qaeda</ENAMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of those surveyed said that ordinary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> had a favorable view of the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX>. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>, polls showed that "the bottom has fallen out of support for
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> in most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX> world. Negative views of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> among <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslims</ENAMEX>, which
                had been largely limited to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Middle East</ENAMEX>, have spread. . . . Since
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last summer</TIMEX>, favorable ratings for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> have fallen from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">61% to 15%</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indonesia</ENAMEX>
                and from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">71% to 38%</NUMEX> among <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslims</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nigeria</ENAMEX>."
            
            Many of these views are at best uninformed about the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> and, at worst,
                informed by cartoonish stereotypes, the coarse expression of a fashionable
                "Occidentalism" among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intellectuals</ENAMEX> who caricature <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> values and policies. Local
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX> and the few influential satellite <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">broadcasters</ENAMEX>-like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Jazeera</ENAMEX>-often
                reinforce the jihadist theme that portrays the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-Muslim</ENAMEX>.
            
            The small percentage of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslims</ENAMEX> who are fully committed to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Usama Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>'s version
                of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Islam</ENAMEX> are impervious to persuasion. It is among the large majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arabs</ENAMEX> and
                <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslims</ENAMEX> that we must encourage reform, freedom, democracy, and opportunity, even
                though our own promotion of these messages is limited in its effectiveness simply
                because we are its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carriers</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslims</ENAMEX> themselves will have to reflect upon such basic
                issues as the concept of jihad, the position of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, and the place of non-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minorities</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> can promote moderation, but cannot ensure its
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ascendancy</ENAMEX>. Only <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslims</ENAMEX> can do this.
            The setting is difficult. The combined gross domestic product of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> in
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arab League</ENAMEX> is less than the GDP of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Forty</NUMEX> percent of adult <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arabs</ENAMEX> are
                illiterate, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two-thirds</NUMEX> of them <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One-third</NUMEX> of the broader <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Middle East</ENAMEX> lives on
                less than <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">two dollars</NUMEX> a day. Less than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2 percent</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> has access to the
                Internet. The majority of older <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">youths</ENAMEX> have expressed a desire to emigrate to
                other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>, particularly those in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>.
            
            In short, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> has to help defeat an ideology, not just a group of
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, and we must do so under difficult circumstances. How can the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>
                and its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> help moderate <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslims</ENAMEX> combat the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">extremist</ENAMEX> ideas?
            
                Recommendation: The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> must define what the message is,
                    what it stands for. We should offer an example of moral <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> in the world,
                    committed to treat <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> humanely, abide by the rule of law, and be generous
                    and caring to our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> can agree on respect for
                    human dignity and opportunity. To <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> have
                    nothing to offer their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> but visions of violence and death. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> and
                    its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> have a crucial advantage-we can offer these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> a vision that
                    might give their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> a better future. If we heed the views of thoughtful
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX> world, a moderate consensus can be found.
            
            That vision of the future should stress life over death: individual educational and
                economic opportunity. This vision includes widespread political participation and
                contempt for indiscriminate violence. It includes respect for the rule of law,
                openness in discussing differences, and tolerance for opposing points of view.
            
                Recommendation: Where <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX>, even those who are
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>, do not respect these principles, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> must stand for a
                    better future. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the lessons of the long <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Cold War</ENAMEX> was that short-term gains
                    in cooperating with the most repressive and brutal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> were too often
                    outweighed by long-term setbacks for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>'s stature and interests.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> foreign policy is part of the message. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>'s policy choices have
                consequences. Right or wrong, it is simply a fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> policy regarding the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli-Palestinian</ENAMEX> conflict and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> actions in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> are dominant <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">staples</ENAMEX> of
                popular commentary across the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX> world. That does not mean <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> choices
                have been wrong. It means those choices must be integrated with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>'s message of
                opportunity to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX> world. Neither <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> nor the new <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> will be
                safer if worldwide <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Islamist</ENAMEX> terrorism grows stronger.
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> must do more to communicate its message. Reflecting on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>'s
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">success</ENAMEX> in reaching <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audiences</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Holbrooke</ENAMEX> wondered, " How can a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> in
                a cave outcommunicate the world's leading communications <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">society</ENAMEX>?" Deputy Secretary
                of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Armitage</ENAMEX> worried to us that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> have been "exporting our
                fears and our anger,"not our vision of opportunity and hope.
            
            
                Recommendation: Just as we did in the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Cold War</ENAMEX>, we need to defend
                    our ideals abroad vigorously. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> does stand up for its values. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX> defended, and still defends, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslims</ENAMEX> against tyrants and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">criminals</ENAMEX> in
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Somalia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bosnia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kosovo</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX>. If the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> does not
                    act aggressively to define itself in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Islamic</ENAMEX> world, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">extremists</ENAMEX> will
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gladly</ENAMEX> do the job for us.
            
            
                
                    Recognizing that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audiences</ENAMEX> rely on satellite
                        television and radio, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> has begun some promising initiatives in
                        television and radio broadcasting to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> world, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>.
                        These efforts are beginning to reach large <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">audiences</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Broadcasting Board</ENAMEX>
                        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Governors</ENAMEX> has asked for much larger resources. It should get them.
                
                
                    The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> should rebuild the scholarship, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX>, and
                        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">library</ENAMEX> programs that reach out to young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and offer them knowledge and
                        hope. Where such assistance is provided, it should be identified as coming
                        from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>.
                
            
            An <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Agenda</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Opportunity</ENAMEX>
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> and its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> can stress educational and economic opportunity.
                The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Nations</ENAMEX> has rightly equated "literacy as freedom."
            
                The international community is moving toward setting a concrete <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">goal-</ENAMEX>to cut
                    the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Middle East</ENAMEX> region's illiteracy rate in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2010</TIMEX>, targeting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> and
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">girls</ENAMEX> and supporting programs for adult literacy.
                Unglamorous help is needed to support the basics, such as textbooks that
                    translate more of the world's knowledge into local languages and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> to
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">house</ENAMEX> such materials. Education about the outside world, or other cultures, is
                    weak.
                More vocational education is needed, too, in trades and business skills. The
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Middle East</ENAMEX> can also benefit from some of the programs to bridge the digital
                    divide and increase Internet access that have already been developed for other
                    regions of the world.
            
            Education that teaches tolerance, the dignity and value of each individual, and
                respect for different beliefs is a key element in any global strategy to eliminate
                Islamist terrorism.
            
                Recommendation: The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> should offer to join with other
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nations</ENAMEX> in generously supporting a new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Youth Opportunity Fund</ENAMEX>.
                    Funds will be spent directly for building and operating primary and secondary
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> in those <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> that commit to sensibly investing their own money
                    in public education.
            
            Economic openness is essential. Terrorism is not caused by poverty. Indeed, many
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX> come from relatively well-off <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>. Yet when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> lose hope, when
                societies break down, when <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> fragment, the breeding grounds for terrorism
                are created. Backward economic policies and repressive political regimes slip into
                societies that are without hope, where ambition and passions have no constructive
                outlet.
            The policies that support economic development and reform also have political
                implications. Economic and political liberties tend to be linked. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commerce</ENAMEX>,
                especially international <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">commerce</ENAMEX>, requires ongoing cooperation and compromise, the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> of ideas across cultures, and the peaceful resolution of differences
                through negotiation or the rule of law. Economic growth expands the middle class, a
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">constituency</ENAMEX> for further reform. Successful economies rely on vibrant private
                sectors, which have an interest in curbing indiscriminate government power. Those
                who develop the practice of controlling their own economic destiny soon desire a
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">voice</ENAMEX> in their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> and political <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">societies</ENAMEX>.
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> has announced the goal of working toward a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Middle East Free Trade</ENAMEX>
                Area, or MEFTA, by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2013</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> has been seeking comprehensive free trade
                agreements (FTAs) with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Middle Eastern</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nations</ENAMEX> most firmly on the path to reform.
                The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FTA</ENAMEX> was enacted in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1985</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> implemented an FTA with
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jordan</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>. Both agreements have expanded trade and investment, thereby
                supporting domestic economic reform. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX>, new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FTAs</ENAMEX> were signed with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Morocco</ENAMEX> and
                Bahrain, and are awaiting congressional approval. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> are drawing the
                interest of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> can become full <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> in the
                rules-based global trading system, as the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> considers lowering its trade
                barriers with the poorest <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nations</ENAMEX>.
            
                Recommendation: A comprehensive <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> strategy to counter terrorism
                    should include economic policies that encourage development, more open
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">societies</ENAMEX>, and opportunities for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to improve the lives of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>
                    and to enhance prospects for their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>'s future.
            
            Turning a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Strategy</ENAMEX> into a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coalition Strategy</ENAMEX>
            Practically every aspect of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>counterterrorism strategy relies on international
                cooperation. Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9/11</TIMEX>, these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contacts</ENAMEX> concerning <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">military</ENAMEX>, law enforcement,
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intelligence</ENAMEX>, travel and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">customs</ENAMEX>, and financial matters have expanded so
                dramatically, and often in an ad hoc way, that it is difficult to track these
                efforts, much less integrate them.
            
                Recommendation: The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> should engage other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nations</ENAMEX> in
                    developing a comprehensive coalition strategy against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Islamist</ENAMEX> terrorism. There
                    are several multilateral <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX> in which such issues should be addressed.
                    But the most important policies should be discussed and coordinated in a
                    flexible contact <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">coalition governments</ENAMEX>. This is a good place,
                    for example, to develop joint strategies for targeting terrorist travel, or for
                    hammering out a common strategy for the places where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX> may be finding
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sanctuary</ENAMEX>.
            
            Presently the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> meet with each other, in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> such as
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Islamic Conference</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arab League</ENAMEX>. The Western <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> meet with each other
                in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group of Eight</ENAMEX> summit of leading industrial
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nations</ENAMEX>. A recent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G-8</ENAMEX> summit initiative to begin a dialogue about reform may be a
                start toward finding a place where leading <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> can discuss-and be seen to
                discuss-critical policy issues with the leading <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Western</ENAMEX> powers committed to the
                future of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX> world. These new international efforts can create
                durable habits of visible cooperation, as states willing to step up to their
                responsibilities join together in constructive efforts to direct assistance and
                coordinate action.
            Coalition warfare also requires <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">coalition</ENAMEX> policies on what to do with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enemy captives</ENAMEX>.
                Allegations that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> abused <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoners</ENAMEX> in its custody make it harder to
                build the diplomatic, political, and military alliances the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> will need.
                The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> should work with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> to develop mutually agreed-on principles
                for the detention and humane treatment of captured international <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX> who are
                not being held under a particular <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>'s criminal laws. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">Countries</ENAMEX> such as
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australia</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>, are committed to fighting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX>.
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> should be able to reconcile its views on how to balance humanity and
                security with our <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s commitment to these same goals. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> and
                some of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">allies</ENAMEX> do not accept the application of full <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Geneva Convention</ENAMEX> treatment
                of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoners</ENAMEX> of war to captured <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX>. Those Conventions establish a minimum
                set of standards for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoners</ENAMEX> in internal conflicts. Since the international
                struggle against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Islamist</ENAMEX> terrorism is not internal, those provisions do not
                formally apply, but they are commonly accepted as basic standards for humane
                treatment.
            
                Recommendation: The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> should engage its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> to
                    develop a common <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">coalition</ENAMEX> approach toward the detention and humane treatment of
                    captured <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX>. New principles might draw upon <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Article 3</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Geneva</ENAMEX>
                    Conventions on the law of armed conflict. That article was specifically designed
                    for those cases in which the usual laws of war did not apply. Its minimum
                    standards are generally accepted throughout the world as customary international
                    law.
            
            Proliferation of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Weapons</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mass Destruction</ENAMEX>
            The greatest danger of another catastrophic attack in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> will
                materialize if the world's most dangerous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX> acquire the world's most
                dangerous <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX>. As we note in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">chapter 2</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> has tried to acquire or make
                nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least ten years</TIMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">chapter 4</ENAMEX>, we mentioned officials
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">worriedly</ENAMEX> discussing, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>, reports that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">associates</ENAMEX> thought their
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> was intent on carrying out a "<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hiroshima</ENAMEX>." These ambitions continue. In the
                public portion of his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February 2004</TIMEX> worldwide threat assessment to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>,
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DCITenet</ENAMEX> noted that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> considered the acquisition of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX> of mass
                destruction to be a "religious obligation." He warned that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> "continues to
                pursue its strategic goal of obtaining a nuclear capability." <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tenet</ENAMEX> added that "more
                than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two dozen</NUMEX> other terrorist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> are pursuing CBRN [<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemical</ENAMEX>, biological,
                radiological, and nuclear] materials."
            
            A nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bomb</ENAMEX> can be built with a relatively small amount of nuclear material. A
                trained nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineer</ENAMEX> with an amount of highly enriched <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">uranium</ENAMEX> or plutonium
                about the size of a grapefruit or an orange, together with commercially available
                material, could fashion a nuclear device that would fit in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">van</ENAMEX> like the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> Ramzi
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">Yousef</ENAMEX> parked in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garage</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Trade Center</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>. Such a bomb would
                level Lower <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manhattan</ENAMEX>.
            
            The coalition strategies we have discussed to combat <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Islamist</ENAMEX> terrorism should
                therefore be combined with a parallel, vital effort to prevent and counter the
                proliferation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX> of mass destruction (WMD). We recommend several initiatives
                in this area.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Strengthen Counterproliferation</ENAMEX> Efforts.
            
            While efforts to shut down <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Libya</ENAMEX>'s illegal nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">program</ENAMEX> have been generally
                successful, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>'s illicit trade and the nuclear smuggling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pakistani</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">scientist A.Q. Khan</ENAMEX> have revealed that the spread of nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX> is a problem of
                global dimensions. Attempts to deal with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX>'s nuclear program are still underway.
                Therefore, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> should work with the international community to develop
                laws and an international legal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX> with universal jurisdiction to enable the
                capture, interdiction, and prosecution of such smugglers by any <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> in the world
                where they do not disclose their activities.
            Expand the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Proliferation Security Initiative</ENAMEX>.
            
            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 2003</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> announced the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Proliferation Security Initiative</ENAMEX>
                (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSI</ENAMEX>): <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nations</ENAMEX> in a willing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partnership</ENAMEX> combining their national capabilities to use
                military, economic, and diplomatic tools to interdict threatening shipments of WMD
                and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missile</ENAMEX>-related technology.
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSI</ENAMEX> can be more effective if it uses intelligence and planning resources of the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">alliance</ENAMEX>. Moreover, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSI</ENAMEX> membership should be open to non- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>.
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> should be encouraged to participate.
            Support the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Cooperative Threat Reduction</ENAMEX> Program.
            
            Outside <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> are deeply worried about the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s commitment and
                approach to securing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX> and highly dangerous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">materials</ENAMEX> still scattered in
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Soviet Union</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s main instrument in
                this area, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">CooperativeThreat Reduction</ENAMEX> Program (usually referred to as
                "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nunn-Lugar</ENAMEX>," after the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senators</ENAMEX> who sponsored the legislation in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX>), is now in
                need of expansion, improvement, and resources. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> has recently
                redoubled its international commitments to support this program, and we recommend
                that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> do all it can, if <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> will do their
                part. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> should weigh the value of this investment against the
                catastrophic cost <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> would face should such <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX> find their way to the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX> who are so anxious to acquire them.
            
                Recommendation: Our report shows that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> has tried to acquire
                    or make weapons of mass destruction for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least ten years</TIMEX>. There is no doubt
                    the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> would be a prime target. Preventing the proliferation of these
                    weapons warrants a maximum effort-by strengthening counterproliferation efforts,
                    expanding the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Proliferation Security Initiative</ENAMEX>, and supporting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cooperative</ENAMEX>
                    Threat Reduction program.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Targeting Terrorist Money</ENAMEX>
            The general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> sees attacks on terrorist finance as a way to "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">starve the</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX> of money." So, initially, did the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>. After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9/11</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX> took aggressive actions to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designate terrorist financiers</ENAMEX> and freeze their
                money, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> and through resolutions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Nations</ENAMEX>. These
                actions appeared to have little effect and, when confronted by legal challenges, the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Nations</ENAMEX> were often forced to unfreeze assets.
            The difficulty, understood later, was that even if the intelligence <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> might
                "link" someone to a terrorist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> through acquaintances or communications, the
                task of tracing the money from that individual to the terrorist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, or otherwise
                showing complicity, was far more difficult. It was harder still to do so without
                disclosing secrets.
            These early missteps made other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> unwilling to freeze assets or otherwise act
                merely on the basis of a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> action. Multilateral freezing mechanisms now require
                waiting periods before being put into effect, eliminating the element of surprise
                and thus virtually ensuring that little money is actually frozen. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Worldwide</ENAMEX> asset
                freezes have not been adequately enforced and have been easily circumvented, often
                within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX>, by simple methods. But trying to starve the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX> of money is
                like trying to catch <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> kind of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fish</ENAMEX> by draining the ocean. A better strategy has
                evolved since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">those early months</TIMEX>, as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> learned more about how <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>
                raises, moves, and spends money.
            
                Recommendation: Vigorous efforts to track terrorist financing must
                    remain front and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> counterterrorism efforts. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> has
                    recognized that information about terrorist money helps us to understand their
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX>, search them out, and disrupt their operations. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelligence</ENAMEX> and law
                    enforcement have targeted the relatively small number of financial
                    facilitators-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> relied on for their ability to raise and
                    deliver money-at the core of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>'s revenue stream. These efforts have
                    worked. The death or capture of several important facilitators has decreased the
                    amount of money available to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> and has increased its costs and difficulty
                    in raising and moving that money. Captures have additionally provided a windfall
                    of intelligence that can be used to continue the cycle of disruption.
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> financial community and some international financial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX> have
                generally provided law enforcement and intelligence <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> with extraordinary
                cooperation, particularly in supplying information to support quickly developing
                investigations. Obvious vulnerabilities in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> financial system have been
                corrected. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> has been less successful in persuading other countries
                to adopt financial regulations that would permit the tracing of financial
                transactions.
            Public designation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorist financiers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> is still part of the
                fight, but it is not the primary <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapon</ENAMEX>. Designations are instead a form of
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">diplomacy</ENAMEX>, as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> join together to identify named <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> as
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX>. They also prevent open fundraising. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">charities</ENAMEX> that have been
                identified as likely <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">avenues</ENAMEX> for terrorist financing have seen their donations WHAT
                TO DO? A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GLOBAL STRATEGY 383</ENAMEX> diminish and their activities come under more scrutiny,
                and others have been put out of business, although controlling overseas <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branches</ENAMEX> of
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gulf</ENAMEX>-area <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">charities</ENAMEX> remains a challenge. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Saudi</ENAMEX> crackdown after the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 2003</TIMEX>
                terrorist attacks in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Riyadh</ENAMEX> has apparently reduced the funds available to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al</ENAMEX>
                Qaeda-perhaps drastically-but it is too soon to know if this reduction will last.
                Though progress apparently has been made, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX> have shown considerable
                creativity in their methods of moving money. If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> is replaced by smaller,
                decentralized terrorist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, the premise behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s efforts-that
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX> need a financial support network-may become outdated. Moreover, some
                terrorist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> do not rely on outside <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of money and may now be
                self-funding, either through legitimate employment or low-level criminal
                    activity.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PROTECT AGAINST AND PREPARE FOR TERRORIST ATTACKS</ENAMEX>
            In the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nearly three years</TIMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9/11</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> have become better protected against
                terrorist attack. Some of the changes are due to government action, such as new
                precautions to protect <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>. A portion can be attributed to the sheer scale of
                spending and effort. Publicity and the vigilance of ordinary <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> also make a
                difference.
            But the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> acknowledge that although <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> may be
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">safer</ENAMEX>, they are not safe. Our report shows that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX> analyze defenses.
                They plan accordingly.
            Defenses cannot achieve perfect safety. They make targets harder to attack
                successfully, and they deter attacks by making capture more likely. Just increasing
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attacker</ENAMEX>'s odds of failure may make the difference between a plan attempted, or
                a plan discarded. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enemy</ENAMEX> also may have to develop more elaborate plans, thereby
                increasing the danger of exposure or defeat.
            Protective measures also prepare for the attacks that may get through, containing the
                damage and saving lives.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Terrorist Travel</ENAMEX>
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">More than 500 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> annually cross <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> borders at legal entry points, about
                <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">330 million</NUMEX> of them noncitizens. Another <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500,000</NUMEX> or more enter illegally without
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inspection</ENAMEX> across <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">thousands of miles</NUMEX> of land borders or remain in the
                country past the expiration of their permitted stay. The challenge for national
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">security</ENAMEX> in an age of terrorism is to prevent the very few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who may pose
                overwhelming risks from entering or remaining in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> undetected.
            
            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the decade</TIMEX> before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 11, 2001</TIMEX>, border security-encompassing travel, entry,
                and immigration-was not seen as a national security matter. Public figures voiced
                concern about the "war on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>," the right level and kind of immigration, problems
                along the southwest border, migration crises originating in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX> and
                elsewhere, or the growing criminal traffic in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>. The immigration system as a
                whole was widely viewed as increasingly dysfunctional and badly in need of reform.
                In national security circles, however, only smuggling of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX> of mass destruction
                carried weight, not the entry of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX> who might use such <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX> or the
                presence of associated foreign-born <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX>.
            For <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX>, travel documents are as important as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Terrorists</ENAMEX> must travel
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clandestinely</ENAMEX> to meet, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX>, plan, case targets, and gain access to attack. To
                them, international travel presents great danger, because they must surface to pass
                through regulated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX>, present themselves to border security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>, or
                attempt to circumvent inspection points.
            In their travels, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX> use evasive methods, such as altered and counterfeit
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">passports</ENAMEX> and visas, specific travel methods and routes, liaisons with corrupt
                government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>, human smuggling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX>, supportive travel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>, and
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immigration</ENAMEX> and identity fraud. These can sometimes be detected.
            Before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9/11</TIMEX>, no <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> systematically analyzed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX>'
                travel strategies. Had they done so, they could have discovered the ways in which
                the terrorist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">predecessors</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> had been systematically but detectably
                exploiting weaknesses in our border security since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1990s</TIMEX>.
            We found that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as many as 15</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> hijackers were potentially vulnerable to
                interception by border <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX>. Analyzing their characteristic travel documents
                and travel patterns could have allowed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> to intercept <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 to 15</NUMEX> hijackers
                and more effective use of information available in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> government databases could
                have identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to 3</NUMEX> hijackers.
            
            Looking back, we can also see that the routine operations of our immigration
                laws-that is, aspects of those laws not specifically aimed at protecting against
                terrorism-inevitably shaped <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>'s planning and opportunities. Because they were
                deemed not to be bona fide <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> as they claimed, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conspirators</ENAMEX>
                that we know of tried to get visas and failed, and one was denied entry by an
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inspector</ENAMEX>. We also found that had the immigration <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">system</ENAMEX> set a higher <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX> for
                determining whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> are who or what they claim to be-and ensuring
                routine consequences for violations-it could potentially have excluded, removed, or
                come into further contact with several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hijackers</ENAMEX> who did not appear to meet the
                terms for admitting short-term <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX>.
            
            Our investigation showed that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> systemic weaknesses came together in our border
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX>'s inability to contribute to an effective defense against the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX> attacks: a
                lack of well-developed counterterrorism measures as a part of border security and an
                immigration system not able to deliver on its basic commitments, much less support
                counterterrorism. These weaknesses have been reduced but are far from being
                overcome.
            
                Recommendation: Targeting travel is at least as powerful a weapon
                    against <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX> as targeting their money. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> should combine
                    terrorist travel intelligence, operations, and law enforcement in a strategy to
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intercept</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX>, find terrorist travel <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">facilitators</ENAMEX>, and constrain
                    terrorist mobility.
            
            Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9/11</TIMEX>, significant improvements have been made to create an integrated watchlist
                that makes terrorist name information available to border and law enforcement
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX>. However, in the already difficult process of merging border <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> in
                the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Homeland Security</ENAMEX>-"changing the engine while flying" as one
                official put it34-new insights into terrorist travel have not yet been integrated
                into the front lines of border security. The small terrorist travel intelligence
                collection and analysis program currently in place has produced disproportionately
                useful results. It should be expanded. Since <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> at the borders encounter
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">travelers</ENAMEX> and their documents <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> and investigate travel <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">facilitators</ENAMEX>, they must
                work closely with intelligence <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>.
            Internationally and in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, constraining terrorist travel should become
                a vital part of counterterrorism strategy. Better technology and training to detect
                terrorist travel documents are the most important immediate steps to reduce
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>'s vulnerability to clandestine entry. Every stage of our border and
                immigration system should have as a part of its operations the detection of
                terrorist indicators on travel documents. Information systems able to authenticate
                travel documents and detect potential terrorist indicators should be used at
                consulates, at primary border inspection lines, in immigration services <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>, and
                in intelligence and enforcement <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>. All frontline <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> should receive some
                training. Dedicated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialists</ENAMEX> and ongoing linkages with the intelligence community
                are also required. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Homeland Security Department</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Directorate of Information</ENAMEX>
                Analysis and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Infrastructure Protection</ENAMEX> should receive more resources to accomplish
                its mission as the bridge between the frontline border <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> and the rest of the
                government counterterrorism <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX>.
            A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biometric Screening System</ENAMEX>
            When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> travel internationally, they usually move through defined channels, or
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">portals</ENAMEX>. They may seek to acquire a passport. They may apply for a visa. They stop
                at ticket counters, gates, and exit controls at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airports</ENAMEX> and seaports. Upon arrival,
                they pass through inspection points. They may transit to another gate to get on an
                airplane. Once inside the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, they may seek another form of identification and
                try to enter a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> or private <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX>. They may seek to change immigration
                status in order to remain.
            Each of these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">checkpoints</ENAMEX> or portals is a screening-a chance to establish that people
                are who they say they are and are seeking access for their stated purpose, to
                intercept identifiable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">suspects</ENAMEX>, and to take effective action. The job of protection
                is shared among these many defined <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">checkpoints</ENAMEX>. By taking advantage of them all, we
                need not depend on any <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> point in the system to do the whole job. The challenge is
                to see the common problem across <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> and functions and develop a conceptual
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">framework-an</ENAMEX> architecture- for an effective screening system.
            
            Throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>, and indeed in private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enterprise</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX> at these
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">portals</ENAMEX> confront recurring judgments that balance security, efficiency, and civil
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">liberties</ENAMEX>. These problems should be addressed systemically, not in an ad hoc,
                fragmented way. For example:
            What information is an individual required to present and in what form?
            
            A fundamental problem, now beginning to be addressed, is the lack of standardized
                information in "feeder" documents used in identifying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>. Biometric
                identifiers that measure unique physical characteristics, such as facial features,
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fingerprints</ENAMEX>, or iris scans, and reduce them to digitized, numerical statements
                called algorithms, are just beginning to be used. Travel history, however, is still
                recorded in passports with entry-exit stamps called cachets, which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> has
                trained its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX> to forge and use to conceal their terrorist activities.
            How will the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> and the information be checked?
             There are many databases just in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>-for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorist</ENAMEX>, criminal, and
                immigration history, as well as financial information, for instance. Each is set up
                for different purposes and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> different kinds of data, under varying rules of
                access. Nor is access always guaranteed. Acquiring information held by foreign
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> may require painstaking negotiations, and records that are not yet
                digitized are difficult to search or analyze. The development of terrorist
                indicators has hardly begun, and behavioral cues remain important.
            Who will screen <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>, and what will they be trained to do?
             A wide range of border, immigration, and law enforcement <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> encounter
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX> and they are given little training in terrorist travel
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intelligence</ENAMEX>. Fraudulent travel documents, for instance, are usually returned to
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">travelers</ENAMEX> who are denied entry without further examination for terrorist trademarks,
                investigation as to their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX>, or legal process.
            What are the consequences of finding a suspicious indicator, and who
                will take action?
             <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> risk is that responses may be ineffective or produce no further information.
                <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attackers</ENAMEX> were pulled into secondary border inspection, but then
                admitted. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">More than half</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> hijackers were flagged by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Aviation</ENAMEX>
                Administration's profiling system when they arrived for their flights, but the
                consequence was that bags, not <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, were checked. Competing risks include "false
                positives,"or the danger that rules may be applied with insufficient training or
                judgment. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Overreactions</ENAMEX> can impose high costs too-on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>, our economy, and
                our beliefs about justice.
            
                A special note on the importance of trusting subjective judgment: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">One</ENAMEX>
                    potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hijacker</ENAMEX> was turned back by an immigration <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inspector</ENAMEX> as he tried to
                    enter the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inspector</ENAMEX> relied on intuitive experience to ask
                    questions more than he relied on any objective factor that could be detected by
                    "scores" or a machine. Good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who have worked in such jobs for a long time
                    understand this phenomenon well. Other evidence we obtained confirmed the
                    importance of letting experienced gate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> or security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">screeners</ENAMEX> ask
                    questions and use their judgment. This is not an invitation to arbitrary
                    exclusions. But any effective system has to grant some scope, perhaps in a
                    little extra inspection or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> more check, to the instincts and discretion of
                    well trained human beings.
            
            
                Recommendation: The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> border security system should be integrated
                    into a larger network of screening points that includes our transportation
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX> and access to vital <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX>, such as nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">reactors</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">President</ENAMEX>
                    should direct the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Homeland Security</ENAMEX> to lead the effort to design a
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comprehensive</ENAMEX> screening system, addressing common problems and setting common
                    standards with systemwide goals in mind. Extending those standards among other
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> could dramatically strengthen <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> and the world's collective
                    ability to intercept <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> who pose catastrophic threats.
            
            We advocate a system for screening, not categorical profiling. A screening system
                looks for particular, identifiable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">suspects</ENAMEX> or indicators of risk. It does not
                involve guesswork about who might be dangerous. It requires frontline border
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> who have the tools and resources to establish that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are who they say
                they are, intercept identifiable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">suspects</ENAMEX>, and disrupt terrorist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX>.
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Border Screening System</ENAMEX>
            The border and immigration system of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> must remain a visible
                manifestation of our belief in freedom, democracy, global economic growth, and the
                rule of law, yet serve equally well as a vital element of counterterrorism.
                Integrating terrorist travel information in the ways we have described is the most
                immediate need. But the underlying system must also be sound.
            Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 11</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> has built the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> phase of a biometric
                screening program, called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US VISIT</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">the United States Visitor and Immigrant Status</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indicator Technology</ENAMEX> program). It takes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> biometric identifiers-digital
                photographs and prints of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> index fingers-from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">travelers</ENAMEX>. False identities are
                used by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX> to avoid being detected on a watchlist. These biometric
                identifiers make such evasions far more difficult. So far, however, only visitors
                who acquire visas to travel to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> are covered. While <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> from
                "visa waiver" <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> will be added to the program, beginning <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX>, covered
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">travelers</ENAMEX> will still constitute <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only about 12 percent</NUMEX> of all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">noncitizens</ENAMEX> crossing
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> borders. Moreover, exit data are not uniformly collected and entry data are not
                fully automated. It is not clear the system can be installed before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2010</TIMEX>, but even
                this timetable may be too slow, given the possible security dangers.
            
            
                <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> should not be exempt from carrying biometric passports or otherwise
                    enabling their identities to be securely verified when they enter the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX>; nor should <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadians or Mexicans</ENAMEX>. Currently <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> are exempt from
                    carrying passports when returning from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX>. The
                    current system enables <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">non-U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> to gain entry by showing minimal
                    identification. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX> experience shows that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX> study and exploit
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>'s vulnerabilities.
                To balance this measure, programs to speed known <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">travelers</ENAMEX> should be a higher
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">priority</ENAMEX>, permitting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inspectors</ENAMEX> to focus on greater risks. The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> commuter
                    should not be subject to the same measures as first-time <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">travelers</ENAMEX>. An
                    individual should be able to preenroll, with his or her identity verified in
                    passage. Updates of database information and other checks can ensure ongoing
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reliability</ENAMEX>. The solution, requiring more research and development, is likely to
                    combine radio frequency technology with biometric identifiers.
                
                The current patchwork of border screening systems, including several frequent
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">traveler</ENAMEX> programs, should be consolidated with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USVISIT</ENAMEX> system to enable the
                    development of an integrated system, which in turn can become part of the wider
                    screening plan we suggest.
                The program allowing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> to travel from foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> through the
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, without having to obtain a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> visa, has been
                    suspended. Because "transit without visa" can be exploited by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX> to
                    enter the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, the program should not be reinstated unless and until
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transit</ENAMEX> passage areas can be fully secured to prevent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> from illegally
                    exiting the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX>.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Inspectors adjudicating</ENAMEX> entries of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX> hijackers lacked adequate information and
                knowledge of the rules. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">All</NUMEX> points in the border system-from consular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> to
                immigration services <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>-will need appropriate electronic access to an
                individual's file. Scattered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Homeland Security</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX>
                perform screening and data mining: instead, a government-wide <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> of border and
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transportation</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> should be working together. A modern border and immigration
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX> should combine a biometric entry-exit system with accessible files on
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX>, along with intelligence on indicators of terrorist travel.
            Our border screening system should check <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> efficiently and welcome <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>.
                Admitting large numbers of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">businesspeople</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> fuels
                our economy, cultural vitality, and political reach. There is evidence that the
                present system is disrupting travel to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. Overall, visa applications
                in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX> were down <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">over 32 percent</NUMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Middle East</ENAMEX>, they declined
                <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 46 percent</NUMEX>. Training and the design of security measures should be
                continuously adjusted.
            
            
                Recommendation: The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Homeland Security</ENAMEX>, properly
                    supported by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>, should complete, as quickly as possible, a biometric
                    entry-exit screening system, including a single system for speeding qualified
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">travelers</ENAMEX>. It should be integrated with the system that provides benefits to
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreigners</ENAMEX> seeking to stay in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. Linking biometric passports to
                    good data systems and decisionmaking is a fundamental goal. No one can hide his
                    or her debt by acquiring a credit card with a slightly different name. Yet
                    today, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorist</ENAMEX> can defeat the link to electronic records by tossing away an
                    old passport and slightly altering the name in the new one.
            
            Completion of the entry-exit system is a major and expensive challenge. Biometrics
                have been introduced into an antiquated computer environment. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Replacement</ENAMEX> of these
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX> and improved biometric systems will be required. Nonetheless, funding and
                completing a biometrics-based entry-exit system is an essential investment in our
                national security.
            Exchanging terrorist information with other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>, consistent with privacy
                requirements, along with listings of lost and stolen passports, will have immediate
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">security</ENAMEX> benefits. We should move toward real-time verification of passports with
                issuing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX>. The further away from our borders that screening occurs, the
                more security benefits we gain. At least some screening should occur before a
                passenger departs on a flight destined for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. We should also work
                with other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> to ensure effective inspection regimes at all <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airports</ENAMEX>.
            
            The international community arrives at international standards for the design of
                passports through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Civil Aviation Organization</ENAMEX> (ICAO). The global
                standard for identification is a digital photograph; fingerprints are optional. We
                must work with others to improve passport standards and provide foreign assistance
                to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> that need help in making the transition.
            
            
                Recommendation: The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> cannot meet its own obligations
                    to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> to prevent the entry of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX> without a major effort
                    to collaborate with other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX>. We should do more to exchange terrorist
                    information with trusted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">allies</ENAMEX>, and raise <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> and global border security
                    standards for travel and border crossing over the medium and long term through
                    extensive international cooperation.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Immigration Law and Enforcement</ENAMEX>
            Our borders and immigration system, including law enforcement, ought to send a
                message of welcome, tolerance, and justice to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrant communities</ENAMEX> in
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> and in their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> of origin. We should reach out to immigrant
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX>. Good immigration services are one way of doing so that is valuable in
                every way-including intelligence. It is elemental to border security to know who is
                coming into the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 9 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>
                outside the legal immigration system. We must also be able to monitor and respond to
                entrances between our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ports</ENAMEX> of entry, working with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> as much as
                possible. There is a growing role for state and local law enforcement <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>. They
                need more training and work with federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> so that they can cooperate more
                effectively with those federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> in identifying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorist suspects</ENAMEX>. All
                but <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX> hijackers acquired some form of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> identification document,
                some by fraud. Acquisition of these forms of identification would have assisted them
                in boarding commercial flights, renting <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX>, and other necessary activities.
            
                Recommendation: Secure identification should begin in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX>. The federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> should set standards for the issuance of birth
                    certificates and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of identification, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">drivers</ENAMEX> licenses. Fraud in
                    identification documents is no longer just a problem of theft. At many entry
                    points to vulnerable <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX>, including gates for boarding <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>, sources
                    of identification are the last opportunity to ensure that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are who they
                    say they are and to check whether they are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX>.
                
            
            Strategies for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aviation and Transportation Security</ENAMEX>
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> transportation system is vast and, in an open society, impossible to secure
                completely against terrorist attacks. There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airports</ENAMEX>,
                <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tens of thousands</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> flights carrying more than half
                a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">billion</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Millions</NUMEX> of containers are imported <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annually</TIMEX> through
                <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 300</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">sea</ENAMEX> and river ports served by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 3,700</NUMEX> cargo and passenger
                <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terminals</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">About 6,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> provide transit services through <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">buses</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">subways</ENAMEX>,
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ferries</ENAMEX>, and light-rail service to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 14 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each weekday</TIMEX>.
            
            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November 2001</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> passed and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> signed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aviation</ENAMEX> and
                Transportation <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Security Act</ENAMEX>. This act created the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transportation Security</ENAMEX>
                Administration (TSA), which is now part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Homeland Security Department</ENAMEX>. In
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November 2002</TIMEX>, both the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Homeland Security Act</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maritime Transportation</ENAMEX>
                Security Act followed. These laws required the development of strategic plans to
                describe how the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSA</ENAMEX> would provide security for critical parts of
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> transportation sector. Over <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90 percent</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$5.3 billion</NUMEX> annual
                investment in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSA</ENAMEX> goes to aviation-to fight the last war. The money has been
                spent mainly to meet congressional mandates to federalize the security checkpoint
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">screeners</ENAMEX> and to deploy existing security methods and technologies at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airports</ENAMEX>. The
                current efforts do not yet reflect a forward-looking strategic plan systematically
                analyzing assets, risks, costs, and benefits. Lacking such a plan, we are not
                convinced that our transportation security resources are being allocated to the
                greatest risks in a cost-effective way.
            
                Major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vulnerabilities</ENAMEX> still exist in cargo and general aviation security.
                    These, together with inadequate screening and access controls, continue to
                    present aviation security challenges.
                While commercial aviation remains a possible <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX> may turn their
                    attention to other modes. Opportunities to do harm are as great, or greater, in
                    maritime or surface transportation. Initiatives to secure shipping containers
                    have just begun. Surface transportation <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">systems</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">railroads</ENAMEX> and mass
                    transit remain hard to protect because they are so accessible and
                extensive.
            
            Despite congressional deadlines, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSA</ENAMEX> has developed neither an integrated
                strategic plan for the transportation <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sector</ENAMEX> nor specific plans for the various
                modes-air, sea, and ground.
            
                Recommendation: Hard choices must be made in allocating limited
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> should identify and evaluate the transportation
                    assets that need to be protected, set risk-based priorities for defending them,
                    select the most practical and cost-effective ways of doing so, and then develop
                    a plan, budget, and funding to implement the effort. The plan should assign
                    roles and missions to the relevant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> (federal, state, regional, and
                    local) and to private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stakeholders</ENAMEX>. In measuring effectiveness, perfection is
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">unattainable</ENAMEX>. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX> should perceive that potential <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> are
                    defended. They may be deterred by a significant chance of failure. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>
                    should set a specific date for the completion of these plans and hold the
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Department</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Homeland Security</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSA</ENAMEX> accountable for achieving them.
            
            The most powerful investments may be for improvements in technologies with
                applications across the transportation modes, such as scanning technologies designed
                to screen containers that can be transported by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX>, ship, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">truck</ENAMEX>, or rail. Though
                such technologies are becoming available now, widespread deployment is still years
                away.
            In the meantime, the best protective measures may be to combine improved methods of
                identifying and tracking the high-risk containers, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operators</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> that
                require added scrutiny with further efforts to integrate intelligence analysis,
                effective procedures for transmitting threat information to transportation
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX>, and vigilance by transportation <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> and the public.
            A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Layered Security System</ENAMEX>
            No single security measure is foolproof. Accordingly, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSA</ENAMEX> must have multiple
                layers of security in place to defeat the more plausible and dangerous forms of
                attack against public transportation.
            
                The plan must take into consideration the full array of possible enemy
                    tactics, such as use of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">insiders</ENAMEX>, suicide terrorism, or standoff attack. Each
                    layer must be effective in its own right. Each must be supported by other layers
                    that are redundant and coordinated.
                The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSA</ENAMEX> should be able to identify for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> the array of potential
                    terrorist attacks, the layers of security in place, and the reliability provided
                    by each layer. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSA</ENAMEX> must develop a plan as described above to improve weak
                    individual layers and the effectiveness of the layered systems it
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">deploys</ENAMEX>.
            
            On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9/11</TIMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> hijackers were screened by a computer-assisted screening system
                called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAPPS</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">More than half</NUMEX> were identified for further inspection, which applied
                only to their checked <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">luggage</ENAMEX>.
            Under current practices, air <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carriers</ENAMEX> enforce government orders to stop certain known
                and suspected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX> from boarding commercial flights and to apply secondary
                screening procedures to others. The "no-fly" and "automatic selectee" lists include
                only those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> who the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> believes pose a direct threat of
                <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">attacking aviation.</ENAMEX>
            Because air <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carriers</ENAMEX> implement the program, concerns about sharing intelligence
                information with private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX> and foreign countries keep the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> from
                listing all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorist</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorist suspects</ENAMEX> who should be included. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSA</ENAMEX> has
                planned to take over this function when it deploys a new screening system to take
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">place</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAPPS</ENAMEX>. The deployment of this system has been delayed because of claims
                it may violate civil liberties.
            
                Recommendation: Improved use of "no-fly" and "automatic selectee"
                    lists should not be delayed while the argument about a successor to CAPPS
                    continues. This screening function should be performed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSA</ENAMEX>, and it should
                    utilize the larger set of watchlists maintained by the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>. Air
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carriers</ENAMEX> should be required to supply the information needed to test and
                    implement this new system.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAPPS</ENAMEX> is still part of the screening process, still profiling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX>, with the
                consequences of selection now including personal searches of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> and
                carry-on bags. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TheTSA</ENAMEX> is dealing with the kind of screening issues that are being
                encountered by other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>. As we mentioned <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX>, these screening issues need
                to be elevated for high-level attention and addressed promptly by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>.
                Working through these problems can help clear the way for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">theTSA</TIMEX>'s screening
                improvements and would help many other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> too. The next layer is the screening
                checkpoint itself. As the screening system tries to stop dangerous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, the
                checkpoint needs to be able to find dangerous items. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> reforms are needed soon:
                (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) screening <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">explosives</ENAMEX>, not just their carry-on bags, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) improving
                screener performance.
            
                Recommendation: The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSA</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> must give priority
                    attention to improving the ability of screening <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">checkpoints</ENAMEX> to detect explosives
                    on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX>. As a start, each individual selected for special screening should
                    be screened for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">explosives</ENAMEX>. Further, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSA</ENAMEX> should conduct a human factors
                    study, a method often used in the private sector, to understand problems in
                    screener performance and set attainable objectives for individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">screeners</ENAMEX> and
                    for the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">checkpoints</ENAMEX> where screening takes place.
            
            Concerns also remain regarding the screening and transport of checked bags and cargo.
                More attention and resources should be directed to reducing or mitigating the threat
                posed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">explosives</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX>' cargo holds. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSA</ENAMEX> should expedite the
                installation of advanced (in-line) baggage-screening equipment. Because the aviation
                industry will derive substantial benefits from this deployment, it should pay a fair
                share of the costs. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSA</ENAMEX> should require that every passenger <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> carrying
                cargo must deploy at least one hardened container to carry any suspect cargo. TSA
                also needs to intensify its efforts to identify, track, and appropriately screen
                potentially dangerous cargo in both the aviation and maritime sectors.
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Protection of Civil Liberties</ENAMEX>
            Many of our recommendations call for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> to increase its presence in our
                lives-for example, by creating standards for the issuance of forms of
                identification, by better securing our borders, by sharing information gathered by
                many different <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>. We also recommend the consolidation of authority over the
                now far-flung <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> constituting the intelligence <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Patriot Act</ENAMEX>
                vests substantial powers in our federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>. We have seen the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> use
                the immigration laws as a tool in its counterterrorism effort. Even without the
                changes we recommend, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> has vested enormous authority in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
                government.
            At our first public hearing on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 31, 2003</TIMEX>, we noted the need for balance as our
                government responds to the real and ongoing threat of terrorist attacks. The
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX> have used our open society against us. In wartime, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> calls for
                greater powers, and then the need for those powers recedes after the war ends. This
                struggle will go on. Therefore, while protecting our <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">homeland</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> should be
                mindful of threats to vital personal and civil liberties. This balancing is no easy
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">task</ENAMEX>, but we must constantly strive to keep it right.
            This shift of power and authority to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> calls for an enhanced system of
                checks and balances to protect the precious liberties that are vital to our way of
                life. We therefore make <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> recommendations.
            First, as we will discuss in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">chapter 13</ENAMEX>, to open up the sharing of information across
                so many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> and with the private sector, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> should take
                responsibility for determining what information can be shared by which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> and
                under what conditions. Protection of privacy rights should be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> key element of
                this determination.
            
                Recommendation: As the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> determines the guidelines for
                    information sharing among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government agencies</ENAMEX> and by those <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> with the
                    private sector, he should safeguard the privacy of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> about whom
                    information is shared.
            
            <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> responded, in the immediate aftermath of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX>, with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Patriot Act</ENAMEX>,
                which vested substantial new powers in the investigative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>.
                Some of the most controversial provisions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Patriot Act</ENAMEX> are to "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">sunset</ENAMEX>" at the
                end of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2005</TIMEX>. Many of the act's provisions are relatively noncontroversial, updating
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>'s surveillance laws to reflect technological developments in a digital age.
                Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> actions that have been criticized are unrelated to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Patriot Act</ENAMEX>.
                The provisions in the act that facilitate the sharing of information among
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intelligence</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> and between law enforcement and intelligence appear, on
                balance, to be beneficial. Because of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concerns</ENAMEX> regarding the shifting balance of
                power to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>, we think that a full and informed debate on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Patriot Act</ENAMEX>
                would be healthy.
            
                Recommendation: The burden of proof for retaining a particular
                    governmental power should be on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX>, to explain (a) that the power
                    actually materially enhances security and (b) that there is adequate supervision
                    of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX>'s use of the powers to ensure protection of civil liberties. If
                    the power is granted, there must be adequate guidelines and oversight to
                    properly confine its use.
            
            <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, during the course of our inquiry, we were told that there is no <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> within
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> whose job it is to look across the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> at the actions we are
                taking to protect ourselves to ensure that liberty concerns are appropriately
                considered. If, as we recommend, there is substantial change in the way we collect
                and share intelligence, there should be a voice within the executive branch for
                those concerns. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> have privacy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>, albeit of limited scope. The
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelligence Oversight Board of the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board</ENAMEX>
                has, in the past, had the job of overseeing certain activities of the intelligence
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">community</ENAMEX>.
            
                Recommendation: At this time of increased and consolidated
                    government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">authority</ENAMEX>, there should be a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> within the executive branch to
                    oversee adherence to the guidelines we recommend and the commitment the
                    government makes to defend our civil liberties.
            
            We must find ways of reconciling security with liberty, since the success of one
                helps protect the other. The choice between security and liberty is a false choice,
                as nothing is more likely to endanger <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>'s liberties than the success of a
                terrorist attack at home. Our history has shown us that insecurity threatens
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">liberty</ENAMEX>. Yet, if our liberties are curtailed, we lose the values that we are
                struggling to defend.
            Setting Priorities for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Preparedness</ENAMEX>
            Before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9/11</TIMEX>, no executive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> had, as its first priority, the job of defending
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> from domestic attack. That changed with the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX> creation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department</ENAMEX>
                of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Homeland Security</ENAMEX>. This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> now has the lead responsibility for problems
                that feature so prominently in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX> story, such as protecting borders, securing
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transportation</ENAMEX> and other parts of our critical infrastructure, organizing emergency
                assistance, and working with the private sector to assess vulnerabilities.
            Throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>, nothing has been harder for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>-executive or
                legislative-than to set priorities, making hard choices in allocating limited
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX>. These difficulties have certainly afflicted the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Homeland</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Security</ENAMEX>, hamstrung by its many congressional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">overseers</ENAMEX>. In delivering assistance to
                state and local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX>, we heard-especially in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>-about imbalances in the
                allocation of money. The argument concentrates on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> questions.
            First, how much money should be set aside for criteria not directly related to risk?
                Currently a major portion of the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">billions of dollars</NUMEX> appropriated for state and
                local assistance is allocated so that each <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> gets a certain amount, or an
                allocation based on its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>-wherever they live.
            
                Recommendation: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Homeland</ENAMEX> security assistance should be based
                    strictly on an assessment of risks and vulnerabilities. Now, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX>,
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">D.C.</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York City</ENAMEX> are certainly at the top of any such list.
                    We understand the contention that every <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> needs to have some
                    minimum infrastructure for emergency response. But federal <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">homeland</ENAMEX> security
                    assistance should not remain a program for general revenue sharing. It should
                    supplement state and local resources based on the risks or vulnerabilities that
                    merit additional support. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> should not use this money as a pork
                barrel.
            
            The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> question is, Can useful criteria to measure risk and vulnerability be
                developed that assess all the many variables? The allocation of funds should be
                based on an assessment of threats and vulnerabilities. That assessment should
                consider such factors as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, population density, vulnerability, and the
                presence of critical infrastructure within each <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. In addition, the federal
                government should require each <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> receiving federal emergency preparedness funds
                to provide an analysis based on the same criteria to justify the distribution of
                funds in that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>.
            In a free-for-all over money, it is understandable that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> will work to
                protect the interests of their home <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">districts</ENAMEX>. But this issue is too
                important for politics as usual to prevail. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Resources</ENAMEX> must be allocated according to
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vulnerabilities</ENAMEX>. We recommend that a panel of security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> be convened to
                develop written benchmarks for evaluating <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> needs. We further recommend that
                federal <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">homeland</ENAMEX> security funds be allocated in accordance with those benchmarks,
                and that states be required to abide by those benchmarks in disbursing the federal
                funds. The benchmarks will be imperfect and subjective; they will continually
                evolve. But hard choices must be made. Those who would allocate money on a different
                basis should then defend their view of the national interest.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Command</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control</ENAMEX>, and Communications
            The attacks on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9/11</TIMEX> demonstrated that even the most robust emergency response
                capabilities can be overwhelmed if an attack is large enough. Teamwork,
                collaboration, and cooperation at an incident site are critical to a successful
                response. Key <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">decisionmakers</ENAMEX> who are represented at the incident command level help
                to ensure an effective response, the efficient use of resources, and responder
                safety. Regular joint training at all levels is, moreover, essential to ensuring
                close coordination during an actual incident.
            
                Recommendation: Emergency response <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> nationwide should adopt
                    the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Incident Command System</ENAMEX> (ICS). When multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> or multiple
                    jurisdictions are involved, they should adopt a unified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">command</ENAMEX>. Both are proven
                    frameworks for emergency response. We strongly support the decision that federal
                    homeland security funding will be contingent, as of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 1, 2004</TIMEX>, upon the
                    adoption and regular use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICS</ENAMEX> and unified command procedures. In the future,
                    the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Homeland Security</ENAMEX> should consider making funding contingent on
                    aggressive and realistic training in accordance with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICS</ENAMEX> and unified command
                    procedures.  The attacks of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 11, 2001</TIMEX> overwhelmed the response
                capacity of most of the local jurisdictions where the hijacked <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">airliners</ENAMEX> crashed.
                While many jurisdictions have established mutual aid compacts, a serious obstacle to
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">multijurisdictional</ENAMEX> response has been the lack of indemnification for mutual-aid
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">responders</ENAMEX> in areas such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Capital Region</ENAMEX>.
            Public safety <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>, chief administrative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX>, state emergency
                management <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Homeland Security</ENAMEX> should develop a
                regional focus within the emergency responder <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> and promote
                multi-jurisdictional mutual assistance compacts. Where such compacts already exist,
                training in accordance with their terms should be required. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> should pass
                legislation to remedy the long-standing indemnification and liability impediments to
                the provision of public safety mutual aid in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Capital Region</ENAMEX> and where
                applicable throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>. The inability to communicate was a critical
                element at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Trade Center</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Somerset County</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX>,
                crash sites, where multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> and multiple jurisdictions responded. The
                occurrence of this problem at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> very different sites is strong evidence that
                compatible and adequate communications among public safety <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> at the
                local, state, and federal levels remains an important problem.
            
                Recommendation: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> should support pending legislation which
                    provides for the expedited and increased assignment of radio spectrum for public
                    safety purposes. Furthermore, high-risk urban areas such as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York City</ENAMEX> and
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">D.C.</ENAMEX>, should establish signal corps <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> to ensure communications
                    connectivity between and among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilian authorities</ENAMEX>, local <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> responders, and
                    the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Guard</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX> funding of such <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> should be given high priority
                    by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>.
            
            Private-Sector Preparedness
            The mandate of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Homeland Security</ENAMEX> does not end with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>; the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> is also responsible for working with the private sector to ensure
                preparedness. This is entirely appropriate, for the private sector controls <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">85</NUMEX>
                percent of the critical infrastructure in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>. Indeed, unless a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorist</ENAMEX>'s
                target is a military or other secure government <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX>, the "first" first
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">responders</ENAMEX> will almost certainly be <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX>. Homeland security and national
                preparedness therefore often begins with the private sector.
            Preparedness in the private sector and public sector for rescue, restart, and
                recovery of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> should include (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) a plan for evacuation, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) adequate
                communications capabilities, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) a plan for continuity of operations. As we
                examined the emergency response to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witness</ENAMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witness</ENAMEX> told us that despite
                <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX>, the private sector remains largely unprepared for a terrorist attack. We were
                also advised that the lack of a widely embraced private-sector preparedness standard
                was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principal</ENAMEX> contributing factor to this lack of preparedness.
            We responded by asking the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American National Standards Institute</ENAMEX> (ANSI) to develop a
                consensus on a "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">National Standard for Preparedness</ENAMEX>" for the private sector. ANSI
                convened safety, security, and business continuity <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> from a wide range of
                industries and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX>, as well as from federal, state, and local government
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stakeholders</ENAMEX>, to consider the need for standards for private sector emergency
                preparedness and business continuity.
            The result of these sessions was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANSI</ENAMEX>'s recommendation that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> endorse a
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">voluntary National Preparedness Standard</ENAMEX>. Based on the existing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American National</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Standard on Disaster/Emergency Management and Business Continuity Programs</ENAMEX> (NFPA
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1600</TIMEX>), the proposed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Preparedness Standard</ENAMEX> establishes a common set of
                criteria and terminology for preparedness, disaster management, emergency
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>, and business continuity programs. The experience of the private sector
                in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Trade Center</ENAMEX> emergency demonstrated the need for these standards.
            
                Recommendation: We endorse the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American National Standards</ENAMEX>
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institute's</ENAMEX> recommended standard for private preparedness. We were encouraged by
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Ridge</ENAMEX>'s praise of the standard, and urge the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of</ENAMEX>
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Homeland Security</ENAMEX> to promote its adoption. We also encourage the insurance and
                    credit-rating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">industries</ENAMEX> to look closely at a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>'s compliance with the ANSI
                    standard in assessing its insurability and creditworthiness. We believe that
                    compliance with the standard should define the standard of care owed by a
