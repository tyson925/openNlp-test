    <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 11, 2001</TIMEX>, dawned temperate and nearly cloudless in the eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Millions</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> readied themselves for work. Some made their way to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Twin Towers</ENAMEX>, the signature structures of the World <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Trade Center</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York City</ENAMEX>. Others went to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arlington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX>, to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX>. Across the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Potomac River</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States Congress</ENAMEX> was back in session. At the other end of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Pennsylvania Avenue</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> began to line up for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> tour. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sarasota</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George W. Bush</ENAMEX> went for an <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early morning</TIMEX> run.

    For those heading to an airport, weather conditions could not have been better for a safe and pleasant journey. Among the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">travelers</ENAMEX> were <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mohamed Atta</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abdul Aziz al Omari</ENAMEX>, who arrived at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portland</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maine</ENAMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INSIDE THE FOUR FLIGHTS</ENAMEX>

Boarding the Flights

    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boston</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American 11</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United 175</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Omari</ENAMEX> boarded a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">6:00 A.M.</TIMEX> flight from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portland</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Logan International Airport</ENAMEX>.

    When he checked in for his flight to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> was selected by a computerized prescreening system known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAPPS</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System</ENAMEX>), created to identify <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> who should be subject to special security measures. Under security rules in place at the time, the only consequence of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX>'s selection by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAPPS</ENAMEX> was that his checked bags were held off the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> until it was confirmed that he had boarded the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>. This did not hinder <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX>'s plans.

    <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Omari</ENAMEX> arrived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">6:45</TIMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Seven</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> later, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> apparently took a call from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marwan al Shehhi</ENAMEX>, a longtime <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleague</ENAMEX> who was at another <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terminal</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Logan Airport</ENAMEX>. They spoke for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three minutes</TIMEX>.

    It would be their final conversation.

    Between <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">6:45 and 7:40</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Omari</ENAMEX>, along with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Satam al Suqami</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wail al Shehri</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Waleed al Shehri</ENAMEX>, checked in and boarded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Airlines</ENAMEX> Flight <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>, bound for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>. The flight was scheduled to depart at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">7:45</TIMEX>.

    In another <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Logan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terminal</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shehhi</ENAMEX>, joined by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fayez Banihammad</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mohand al Shehri</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ahmed al Ghamdi</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hamza al Ghamdi</ENAMEX>, checked in for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Airlines</ENAMEX> Flight 175, also bound for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A couple of Shehhi</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> were obviously unused to travel; according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX> ticket <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX>, they had trouble understanding the standard security questions, and she had to go over them slowly until they gave the routine, reassuring answers.

    Their flight was scheduled to depart at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:00</TIMEX>.

    The security checkpoints through which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX>, gained access to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> 11 gate were operated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Globe Security</ENAMEX> under a contract with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Airlines</ENAMEX>. In a different terminal, the single checkpoint through which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United 175</ENAMEX> passed was controlled by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Airlines</ENAMEX>, which had contracted with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Huntleigh USA</ENAMEX> to perform the screening.

    In passing through these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">checkpoints</ENAMEX>, each of the hijackers would have been screened by a walk-through metal detector calibrated to detect items with at least the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">metal</ENAMEX> content of a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">.22-caliber</NUMEX> handgun. Anyone who might have set off that detector would have been screened with a hand wand-a procedure requiring the screener to identify the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">metal item</ENAMEX> or items that caused the alarm. In addition, an X-ray machine would have screened the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hijackers</ENAMEX>' carry-on belongings. The screening was in place to identify and confiscate <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX> and other items prohibited from being carried onto a commercial flight.

    None of the checkpoint <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supervisors</ENAMEX> recalled the hijackers or reported anything suspicious regarding their screening.

    While <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> had been selected by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAPPS</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portland</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of his hijacking team-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Suqami</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wail al Shehri</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Waleed al Shehri</ENAMEX>-were selected in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX>. Their selection affected only the handling of their checked bags, not their screening at the checkpoint. All <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> cleared the checkpoint and made their way to the gate for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Omari</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Suqami</ENAMEX> took their seats in business class (seats 8D, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8G</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">10B</ENAMEX>, respectively). The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shehri</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brothers</ENAMEX> had adjacent seats in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">row 2</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wail</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2A</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Waleed</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2B</TIMEX>), in the firstclass <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cabin</ENAMEX>. They boarded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">11 between 7:31 and 7:40</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> pushed back from the gate at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">7:40</TIMEX>.

    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shehhi</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX>, none of whom had been selected by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAPPS</ENAMEX>, boarded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">175 between 7:23 and 7:28</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Banihammad</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2A</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shehri</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2B</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shehhi</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6C</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hamza al Ghamdi</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9C</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ahmed al Ghamdi</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9D</TIMEX>). Their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> pushed back from the gate just before <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:00</TIMEX>.

    <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> Dulles: <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">77</TIMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Hundreds</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">miles</NUMEX> southwest of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX>, at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Dulles International Airport</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX> suburbs of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">D.C.</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> were preparing to take their <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early morning</TIMEX> flight. At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">7:15</TIMEX>, a pair of them, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Khalid al Mihdhar</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Majed Moqed</ENAMEX>, checked in at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Airlines</ENAMEX> ticket counter for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Flight 77</ENAMEX>, bound for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>. Within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the next 20 minutes</TIMEX>, they would be followed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hani Hanjour</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brothers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nawaf al Hazmi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salem al Hazmi</ENAMEX>.

    <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hani Hanjour</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Khalid al Mihdhar</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Majed Moqed</ENAMEX> were flagged by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAPPS</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hazmi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brothers</ENAMEX> were also selected for extra scrutiny by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">airline</ENAMEX>'s customer service <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> at the check-in counter. He did so because one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brothers</ENAMEX> did not have photo identification nor could he understand <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, and because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> found both of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> to be suspicious. The only consequence of their selection was that their checked bags were held off the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> until it was confirmed that they had boarded the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>.

    All <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> hijackers passed through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Main Terminal</ENAMEX>'s west security screening <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">checkpoint</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Airlines</ENAMEX>, which was the responsible air <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carrier</ENAMEX>, had contracted out the work to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Argenbright Security</ENAMEX>.

    The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">checkpoint</ENAMEX> featured closed-circuit television that recorded all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX>, including the hijackers, as they were screened. At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">7:18</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mihdhar</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moqed</ENAMEX> entered the security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">checkpoint</ENAMEX>.

    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mihdhar</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moqed</ENAMEX> placed their carry-on bags on the belt of the X-ray machine and proceeded through the first metal detector. Both set off the alarm, and they were directed to a second metal detector. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mihdhar</ENAMEX> did not trigger the alarm and was permitted through the checkpoint. After <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moqed</ENAMEX> set it off, a screener wanded him. He passed this inspection.

    <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">About</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20 minutes</TIMEX> later, at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">7:35</TIMEX>, another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passenger</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Flight 77</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hani Hanjour</ENAMEX>, placed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two carry-on</NUMEX> bags on the X-ray belt in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Main Terminal</ENAMEX>'s west checkpoint, and proceeded, without alarm, through the metal detector. A <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">short time</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nawaf</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salem al Hazmi</ENAMEX> entered the same checkpoint. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salem al Hazmi</ENAMEX> cleared the metal detector and was permitted through; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nawaf al Hazmi</ENAMEX> set off the alarms for both the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> metal detectors and was then hand-wanded before being passed. In addition, his over-the-shoulder carry-on bag was swiped by an explosive trace detector and then passed. The video footage indicates that he was carrying an unidentified item in his back pocket, clipped to its rim.

    When the local civil aviation security <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Aviation Administration</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>) later investigated these security screening operations, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">screeners</ENAMEX> recalled nothing out of the ordinary. They could not recall that any of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> they screened were <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAPPS</ENAMEX> selectees. We asked a screening <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX> to review the videotape of the hand-wanding, and he found the quality of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">screener</ENAMEX>'s work to have been "marginal at best." The screener should have "resolved" what set off the alarm; and in the case of both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moqed</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hazmi</ENAMEX>, it was clear that he did not.

    At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">7:50</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Majed Moqed</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Khalid al Mihdhar</ENAMEX> boarded the flight and were seated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12A and 12B</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coach</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hani Hanjour</ENAMEX>, assigned to seat 1B (<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> class), soon followed. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hazmi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brothers</ENAMEX>, sitting in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5E and 5F</TIMEX>, joined <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hanjour</ENAMEX> in the first-class <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cabin</ENAMEX>.

    <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Newark</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United 93</ENAMEX>. Between <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">7:03 and 7:39</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saeed al Ghamdi</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ahmed al Nami</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ahmad al Haznawi</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ziad Jarrah</ENAMEX> checked in at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Airlines</ENAMEX> ticket counter for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Flight 93</ENAMEX>, going to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> checked bags; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> did not. Haznawi was selected by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAPPS</ENAMEX>. His checked bag was screened for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">explosives</ENAMEX> and then loaded on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX>.

    The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> passed through the security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">checkpoint</ENAMEX>, owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Airlines</ENAMEX> and operated under contract by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Argenbright Security</ENAMEX>. Like the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">checkpoints</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX>, it lacked closed-circuit television surveillance so there is no documentary evidence to indicate when the hijackers passed through the checkpoint, what alarms may have been triggered, or what security procedures were administered. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> interviewed the screeners later; none recalled anything unusual or suspicious.

    The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> boarded the plane <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">between 7:39 and 7:48</TIMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">All four</NUMEX> had seats in the first-class <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cabin</ENAMEX>; their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> had no business-class section. Jarrah was in seat <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1B</TIMEX>, closest to the cockpit; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nami</ENAMEX> was in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3C</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ghamdi</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3D</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Haznawi</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6B</TIMEX>.

    The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> were aboard <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> transcontinental flights.

    They were planning to hijack these <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX> and turn them into large guided <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missiles</ENAMEX>, loaded with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">up to 11,400 gallons</NUMEX> of jet <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fuel</ENAMEX>. By <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:00 A.M.</TIMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September</TIMEX> 11,2001, they had defeated all the security layers that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>'s civil aviation security <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> then had in place to prevent a hijacking. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hijacking of American 11 American Airlines</ENAMEX> Flight <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> provided nonstop service from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 11</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Captain John Ogonowski</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Officer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas McGuinness</ENAMEX> piloted the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">767</ENAMEX>. It carried its full capacity of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> flight <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attendants</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Eighty</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> boarded the flight with them (including the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX>)<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.22</NUMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> took off at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">7:59</TIMEX>. Just before <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:14</TIMEX>, it had climbed to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">26,000 feet</NUMEX>, not quite its initial assigned cruising altitude of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">29,000 feet</NUMEX>. All communications and flight profile data were normal. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">About this time</TIMEX> the "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Fasten Seatbelt</ENAMEX>" sign would usually have been turned off and the flight <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attendants</ENAMEX> would have begun preparing for cabin service.

    At that same time, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American 11</ENAMEX> had its last routine communication with the ground when it acknowledged navigational instructions from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>'s air traffic control (ATC) <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Sixteen seconds</TIMEX> after that transmission, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATC</ENAMEX> instructed the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> to climb to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">35,000 feet</NUMEX>. That message and all subsequent attempts to contact the flight were not acknowledged. From this and other evidence, we believe the hijacking began at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:14</TIMEX> or shortly thereafter.

    Reports from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> flight <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attendants</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coach</ENAMEX> cabin, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Betty Ong</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Madeline</ENAMEX> "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Amy</ENAMEX>" <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sweeney</ENAMEX>, tell us most of what we know about how the hijacking happened. As it began, some of the hijackers-most likely <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wail al Shehri</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Waleed al Shehri</ENAMEX>, who were seated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">row 2</TIMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> class-stabbed the two unarmed flight <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attendants</ENAMEX> who would have been preparing for cabin service.

    We do not know exactly how the hijackers gained access to the cockpit; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> rules required that the doors remain closed and locked during flight. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ong</ENAMEX> speculated that they had "jammed their way" in. Perhaps the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX> stabbed the flight <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attendants</ENAMEX> to get a cockpit key, to force one of them to open the cockpit door, or to lure the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">captain</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> out of the cockpit. Or the flight <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attendants</ENAMEX> may just have been in their way.

    At the same time or shortly thereafter, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX>-the only terrorist on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> trained to fly a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">jet</ENAMEX>-would have moved to the cockpit from his business-class seat, possibly accompanied by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Omari</ENAMEX>. As this was happening, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passenger</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel Lewin</ENAMEX>, who was seated in the row just behind <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Omari</ENAMEX>, was stabbed by one of the hijackers-probably <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Satam al Suqami</ENAMEX>, who was seated directly behind <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lewin</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lewin</ENAMEX> had served <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four years</TIMEX> as an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli</ENAMEX> military. He may have made an attempt to stop the hijackers in front of him, not realizing that another was sitting behind him.

    The hijackers quickly gained control and sprayed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mace</ENAMEX>, pepper <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spray</ENAMEX>, or some other irritant in the first-class <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cabin</ENAMEX>, in order to force the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> and flight <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attendants</ENAMEX> toward the rear of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX>. They claimed they had a bomb.

    <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">About</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five minutes</TIMEX> after the hijacking began, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Betty Ong</ENAMEX> contacted the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Airlines Southeastern Reservations Office</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cary</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Carolina</ENAMEX>, via an AT&T airphone to report an emergency aboard the flight. This was the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of several occasions on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9/11</TIMEX> when flight <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attendants</ENAMEX> took action outside the scope of their training, which emphasized that in a hijacking, they were to communicate with the cockpit <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crew</ENAMEX>. The emergency call lasted <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">approximately 25 minutes</TIMEX>, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ong</ENAMEX> calmly and professionally relayed information about events taking place aboard the airplane to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> on the ground.

    At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:19</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ong</ENAMEX> reported:"The cockpit is not answering, somebody's stabbed in business class-and I think there's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mace</ENAMEX>-that we can't breathe-I don't know, I think we're getting hijacked." She then told of the stabbings of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> flight <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attendants</ENAMEX>.

    At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:21</TIMEX>, one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ong</ENAMEX>'s call in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Carolina</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nydia Gonzalez</ENAMEX>, alerted the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Airlines</ENAMEX> operations <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fort Worth</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>, reaching <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Craig Marquis</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> on duty. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marquis</ENAMEX> soon realized this was an emergency and instructed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">airline</ENAMEX>'s dispatcher responsible for the flight to contact the cockpit. At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:23</TIMEX>, the dispatcher tried unsuccessfully to contact the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Six</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> later, the air traffic control <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialist</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>'s operations <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">center</ENAMEX> contacted the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boston Air Traffic Control Center</ENAMEX> about the flight. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> was already aware of the problem.

    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boston Center</ENAMEX> knew of a problem on the flight in part because just before <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:25</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hijackers</ENAMEX> had attempted to communicate with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX>. The microphone was keyed, and immediately one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hijackers</ENAMEX> said, "Nobody move. Everything will be okay. If you try to make any moves, you'll endanger yourself and the airplane. Just stay quiet." Air traffic controllers heard the transmission; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ong</ENAMEX> did not. The hijackers probably did not know how to operate the cockpit radio communication system correctly, and thus inadvertently broadcast their message over the air traffic control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> instead of the cabin public-address <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX>. Also at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:25</TIMEX>, and again at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:29</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amy Sweeney</ENAMEX> got through to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Flight Services Office</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX> but was cut off after she reported someone was hurt aboard the flight. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Three minutes</TIMEX> later, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sweeney</ENAMEX> was reconnected to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> and began relaying updates to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Woodward</ENAMEX>.

    At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:26</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ong</ENAMEX> reported that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> was "flying erratically." <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">A minute</TIMEX> later, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Flight 11</ENAMEX> turned south. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX> also began getting identifications of the hijackers, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ong</ENAMEX> and then <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sweeney</ENAMEX> passed on some of the seat numbers of those who had gained unauthorized access to the cockpit.

    Sweeney calmly reported on her line that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> had been hijacked; a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> class had his throat slashed; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> flight <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attendants</ENAMEX> had been stabbed-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> was seriously hurt and was on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> while the other's wounds seemed minor; a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> had been requested; the flight <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attendants</ENAMEX> were unable to contact the cockpit; and there was a bomb in the cockpit. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sweeney</ENAMEX> told <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Woodward</ENAMEX> that she and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ong</ENAMEX> were trying to relay as much information as they could to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> on the ground.

    At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:38</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ong</ENAMEX> told <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gonzalez</ENAMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> was flying erratically again. Around this time <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sweeney</ENAMEX> told <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Woodward</ENAMEX> that the hijackers were <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Middle Easterners</ENAMEX>, naming <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of their seat numbers. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> spoke very little <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> and one spoke excellent <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hijackers</ENAMEX> had gained entry to the cockpit, and she did not know how. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> was in a rapid descent.

    At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:41</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sweeney</ENAMEX> told <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Woodward</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coach</ENAMEX> were under the impression that there was a routine medical emergency in <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> class. Other flight <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attendants</ENAMEX> were busy at duties such as getting medical supplies while <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ong</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sweeney</ENAMEX> were reporting the events.

    At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:41</TIMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>'s operations <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleague</ENAMEX> told <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marquis</ENAMEX> that the air traffic controllers declared <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Flight 11</ENAMEX> a hijacking and "think he's [<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">11</ENAMEX>] headed toward <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kennedy</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York City</ENAMEX>]. They're moving everybody out of the way. They seem to have him on a primary radar. They seem to think that he is descending."

    At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:44</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gonzalez</ENAMEX> reported losing phone contact with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ong</ENAMEX>. About this same time <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sweeney</ENAMEX> reported to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Woodward</ENAMEX>, "Something is wrong. We are in a rapid descent . . . we are all over the place." <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Woodward</ENAMEX> asked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sweeney</ENAMEX> to look out the window to see if she could determine where they were. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sweeney</ENAMEX> responded:"We are flying low. We are flying very, very low. We are flying way too low." <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Seconds later</TIMEX> she said,"Oh my God we are way too low." The phone call ended.

    At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:46:40</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> crashed into the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North Tower of the World Trade Center</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York City</ENAMEX>.

    All on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX>, along with an unknown number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX>, were killed instantly.

    The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hijacking</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United 175 United Airlines</ENAMEX> Flight 175 was scheduled to depart for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:00</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Captain Victor Saracini</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Officer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Horrocks</ENAMEX> piloted the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">767</ENAMEX>, which had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> flight <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attendants</ENAMEX>. Fifty-six <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> boarded the flight.

    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United 175</ENAMEX> pushed back from its gate at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">7:58</TIMEX> and departed <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Logan Airport</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:14</TIMEX>. By <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:33</TIMEX>, it had reached its assigned cruising altitude of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">31,000 feet</NUMEX>. The flight <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attendants</ENAMEX> would have begun their cabin service.

    The flight had taken off just as American <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> was being hijacked, and at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:42</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United 175</ENAMEX> flight <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crew</ENAMEX> completed their report on a "suspicious transmission" overheard from another <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> (which turned out to have been Flight <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>) just after takeoff. This was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United 175</ENAMEX>'s last communication with the ground.

    The hijackers attacked sometime <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">between 8:42 and 8:46</TIMEX>. They used knives (as reported by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> and a flight attendant), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mace</ENAMEX> (reported by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> passenger), and the threat of a bomb (reported by the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passenger</ENAMEX>). They stabbed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the flight <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crew</ENAMEX> (reported by a flight attendant and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> passenger). Both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> had been killed (reported by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> flight attendant). The eyewitness accounts came from calls made from the rear of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX>, from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> originally seated further forward in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cabin</ENAMEX>, a sign that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> and perhaps <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crew</ENAMEX> had been moved to the back of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>. Given similarities to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> in hijacker seating and in eyewitness reports of tactics and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX>, as well as the contact between the presumed team <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shehhi</ENAMEX>, we believe the tactics were similar on both flights.

    The first operational evidence that something was abnormal on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United 175</ENAMEX> came at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:47</TIMEX>, when the aircraft changed beacon codes twice within a minute. At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:51</TIMEX>, the flight deviated from its assigned altitude, and a minute later <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> air traffic controllers began repeatedly and unsuccessfully trying to contact it.

    At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:52</TIMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Easton</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Connecticut</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee Hanson</ENAMEX> received a phone call from his son <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter</ENAMEX>, a passenger on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United 175</ENAMEX>. His <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> told him: "I think they've taken over the cockpit-An <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attendant</ENAMEX> has been stabbed- and someone else up front may have been killed. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> is making strange moves. Call <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Airlines</ENAMEX>-Tell them it's <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Flight 175</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">LA.</ENAMEX>" <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee Hanson</ENAMEX> then called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Easton Police Department</ENAMEX> and relayed what he had heard.

    Also at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:52</TIMEX>, a male flight attendant called a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">United office</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX>, reaching <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marc Policastro</ENAMEX>. The flight attendant reported that the flight had been hijacked, both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> had been killed, a flight attendant had been stabbed, and the hijackers were probably flying the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX>. The call lasted <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about two minutes</TIMEX>, after which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Policastro</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleague</ENAMEX> tried unsuccessfully to contact the flight.

    At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:58</TIMEX>, the flight took a heading toward <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York City</ENAMEX>.

    At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:59</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Flight 175</ENAMEX> passenger <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brian David Sweeney</ENAMEX> tried to call his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Julie</ENAMEX>. He left a message on their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> answering machine that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> had been hijacked. He then called his mother, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louise Sweeney</ENAMEX>, told her the flight had been hijacked, and added that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> were thinking about storming the cockpit to take control of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> away from the hijackers.

    At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:00</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee Hanson</ENAMEX> received a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> call from his son <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter</ENAMEX>: It's getting bad, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dad</ENAMEX>-A stewardess was stabbed-They seem to have knives and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mace</ENAMEX>-They said they have a bomb-It's getting very bad on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Passengers</ENAMEX> are throwing up and getting sick-The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> is making jerky movements-I don't think the pilot is flying the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX>-I think we are going down-I think they intend to go to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX> or someplace and fly into a building-Don't worry, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dad</ENAMEX>- If it happens, it'll be very fast-My God, my God.

    The call ended abruptly. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee Hanson</ENAMEX> had heard a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> scream just before it cut off. He turned on a television, and in her home so did <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louise Sweeney</ENAMEX>. Both then saw the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> hit the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Trade Center</ENAMEX>.

    At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:03:11</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Airlines</ENAMEX> Flight 175 struck the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">South Tower of the World Trade Center</ENAMEX>.

    All on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX>, along with an unknown number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX>, were killed instantly.

    The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hijacking of American 77 American Airlines</ENAMEX> Flight <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">77</TIMEX> was scheduled to depart from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> Dulles for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:10</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> was a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">757</ENAMEX> piloted by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Captain Charles F. Burlingame</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Officer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Charlebois</ENAMEX>. There were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> flight <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attendants</ENAMEX>. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 11</TIMEX>, the flight carried <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">58</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX>.

    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American 77</ENAMEX> pushed back from its gate at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:09</TIMEX> and took off at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:20</TIMEX>. At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:46</TIMEX>, the flight reached its assigned cruising altitude of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">35,000 feet</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Cabin</ENAMEX> service would have begun. At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:51</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> 77 transmitted its last routine radio communication. The hijacking began <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">between 8:51 and 8:54</TIMEX>. As on <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United 175</ENAMEX>, the hijackers used knives (reported by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> passenger) and moved all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> (and possibly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crew</ENAMEX>) to the rear of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> (reported by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> flight attendant and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> passenger). Unlike the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> flights, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Flight 77</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">hijackers</ENAMEX> were reported by a passenger to have box cutters. Finally, a passenger reported that an announcement had been made by the "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot</ENAMEX>" that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> had been hijacked. Neither of the firsthand accounts mentioned any stabbings or the threat or use of either a bomb or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mace</ENAMEX>, though both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witnesses</ENAMEX> began the flight in the first-class <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cabin</ENAMEX>.

    At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:54</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> deviated from its assigned course, turning south. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Two minutes</TIMEX> later the transponder was turned off and even primary radar contact with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> was lost. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indianapolis Air Traffic Control Center</ENAMEX> repeatedly tried and failed to contact the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Airlines</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dispatchers</ENAMEX> also tried, without success.

    At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:00</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Airlines</ENAMEX> Executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gerard Arpey</ENAMEX> learned that communications had been lost with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">77</TIMEX>. This was now the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> in trouble. He ordered all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Airlines</ENAMEX> flights in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Northeast</ENAMEX> that had not taken off to remain on the ground. Shortly before <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:10</TIMEX>, suspecting that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American 77</ENAMEX> had been hijacked, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX> concluded that the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> to hit the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Trade Center</ENAMEX> might have been Flight <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">77</NUMEX>. After learning that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Airlines</ENAMEX> was missing a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Airlines</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX> extended the ground stop nationwide.

    At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:12</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Renee May</ENAMEX> called her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nancy May</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Vegas</ENAMEX>. She said her flight was being hijacked by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> who had moved them to the rear of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX>. She asked her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> to alert <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Airlines</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nancy May</ENAMEX> and her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> promptly did so.

    At some point <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">between 9:16 and 9:26</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barbara Olson</ENAMEX> called her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ted Olson</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">solicitor general</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. She reported that the flight had been hijacked, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hijackers</ENAMEX> had knives and box cutters. She further indicated that the hijackers were not aware of her phone call, and that they had put all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> in the back of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">About</NUMEX> a minute into the conversation, the call was cut off. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Solicitor General</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Olson</ENAMEX> tried unsuccessfully to reach <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Attorney General</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Ashcroft</ENAMEX>.

    Shortly after the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> call, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barbara Olson</ENAMEX> reached her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> again. She reported that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot</ENAMEX> had announced that the flight had been hijacked, and she asked her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> what she should tell the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">captain</ENAMEX> to do. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ted Olson</ENAMEX> asked for her location and she replied that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> was then flying over <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX>. Another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passenger</ENAMEX> told her they were traveling northeast. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Solicitor General</ENAMEX> then informed his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> previous hijackings and crashes. She did not display signs of panic and did not indicate any awareness of an impending crash. At that point, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> call was cut off.

    At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:29</TIMEX>, the autopilot on <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">77</TIMEX> was disengaged; the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> was at <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">7,000 feet</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">approximately 38 miles</NUMEX> west of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX>.

    At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:32</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">controllers</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dulles Terminal Radar Approach Control</ENAMEX> "observed a primary radar target tracking eastbound at a high rate of speed." This was later determined to have been Flight <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">77</NUMEX>.

    At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:34</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald Reagan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Washington National Airport</ENAMEX> advised the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Secret Service</ENAMEX> of an unknown aircraft heading in the direction of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American 77</ENAMEX> was then <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 miles</NUMEX> west-southwest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> and began a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">330</NUMEX>-degree turn. At <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the turn</TIMEX>, it was descending through <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2,200 feet</NUMEX>, pointed toward the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> and downtown <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>. The hijacker <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot</ENAMEX> then advanced the throttles to maximum power and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dove</ENAMEX> toward the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX>.

    At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:37:46</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Airlines</ENAMEX> Flight <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">77</NUMEX> crashed into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX>, traveling at <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">approximately 530 miles per hour</NUMEX>.

    All on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX>, as well as many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilian</ENAMEX> and military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>, were killed.

    The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Battle</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">United 93</ENAMEX> At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:42</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Airlines</ENAMEX> Flight <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">93</NUMEX> took off from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Newark</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Jersey</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Liberty International Airport</ENAMEX> bound for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> was piloted by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Captain Jason Dahl</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Officer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leroy Homer</ENAMEX>, and there were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> flight <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attendants</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thirty</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX>, including the hijackers, boarded the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX>. Scheduled to depart the gate at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:00</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">757</ENAMEX>'s takeoff was delayed because of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX>'s typically heavy morning traffic.

    The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hijackers</ENAMEX> had planned to take flights scheduled to depart at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">7:45</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>), <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:00</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">United 175 and United 93</ENAMEX>), and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:10</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">77</TIMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> of the flights had actually taken off within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 to 15 minutes</TIMEX> of their planned departure times. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United 93</ENAMEX> would ordinarily have taken off <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 15 minutes</TIMEX> after pulling away from the gate. When it left the ground at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:42</TIMEX>, the flight was running <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">more than 25 minutes</TIMEX> late.

    As <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">United 93</ENAMEX> left <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Newark</ENAMEX>, the flight's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crew members</ENAMEX> were unaware of the hijacking of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>. Around <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:00</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX> were facing the staggering realization of apparent multiple hijackings. At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:03</TIMEX>, they would see another <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> strike the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Trade Center</ENAMEX>. Crisis <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">airlines</ENAMEX> did not yet act to warn other <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>.

    At the same time, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boston Center</ENAMEX> realized that a message transmitted just before <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:25</TIMEX> by the hijacker <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> included the phrase, "We have some <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX>."

    No one at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">airlines</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that day</TIMEX> had ever dealt with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple hijackings</ENAMEX>. Such a plot had not been carried out anywhere in the world in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than 30 years</TIMEX>, and never in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. As news of the hijackings filtered through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">airlines</ENAMEX>, it does not seem to have occurred to their leadership that they needed to alert other <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> in the air that they too might be at risk.

    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United 175</ENAMEX> was hijacked <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">between 8:42 and 8:46</TIMEX>, and awareness of that hijacking began to spread after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:51</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American 77</ENAMEX> was hijacked <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">between 8:51 and 8:54</TIMEX>. By <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:00</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> and airline <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> began to comprehend that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attackers</ENAMEX> were going after multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Airlines</ENAMEX>' nationwide ground stop <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">between 9:05 and 9:10</TIMEX> was followed by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Airlines</ENAMEX> ground stop. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">controllers</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boston Center</ENAMEX>, which had tracked <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first two hijackings</TIMEX>, requested at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:07</TIMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Herndon Command Center</ENAMEX> "get messages to airborne <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> to increase security for the cockpit." There is no evidence that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herndon</ENAMEX> took such action. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boston Center</ENAMEX> immediately began speculating about other <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> that might be in danger, leading them to worry about a transcontinental flight-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1989</ENAMEX>-that in fact was not hijacked. At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:19</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New England</ENAMEX> regional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Herndon</ENAMEX> and asked that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cleveland Center</ENAMEX> advise <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1989</ENAMEX> to use extra cockpit security.

    Several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> air traffic control <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> told us it was the air <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carriers</ENAMEX>' responsibility to notify their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX> of security problems. One senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> air traffic control <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> said that it was simply not the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>'s place to order the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">airlines</ENAMEX> what to tell their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX>.

    We believe such statements do not reflect an adequate appreciation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>'s responsibility for the safety and security of civil aviation.

    The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">airlines</ENAMEX> bore responsibility, too. They were facing an escalating number of conflicting and, for the most part, erroneous reports about other flights, as well as a continuing lack of vital information from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> about the hijacked flights. We found no evidence, however, that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Airlines</ENAMEX> sent any cockpit warnings to its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>'s first decisive action to notify its airborne <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> to take defensive action did not come until <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:19</TIMEX>, when a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX> flight dispatcher, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ed Ballinger</ENAMEX>, took the initiative to begin transmitting warnings to his <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> transcontinental flights: "Beware any cockpit intrusion- <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> a/c [<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>] hit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Trade Center</ENAMEX>." <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the flights that received the warning was <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">United 93</ENAMEX>. Because <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ballinger</ENAMEX> was still responsible for his other flights as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Flight 175</ENAMEX>, his warning message was not transmitted to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Flight 93</ENAMEX> until <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:23</TIMEX>.

    By all accounts, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the first 46 minutes</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Flight 93</ENAMEX>'s cross-country trip proceeded routinely. Radio communications from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> were normal. Heading, speed, and altitude ran according to plan. At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:24</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ballinger</ENAMEX>'s warning to <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">United 93</ENAMEX> was received in the cockpit. Within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two minutes</TIMEX>, at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:26</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jason Dahl</ENAMEX>, responded with a note of puzzlement: "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ed</ENAMEX>, confirm latest mssg plz-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jason</ENAMEX>."

    The hijackers attacked at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:28</TIMEX>. While traveling <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">35,000 feet</NUMEX> above eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United 93</ENAMEX> suddenly dropped <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">700 feet</NUMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Eleven</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">seconds</TIMEX> into the descent, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>'s air traffic control <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cleveland</ENAMEX> received the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> radio transmissions from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>. During the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> broadcast, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">captain</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> could be heard declaring "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Mayday</ENAMEX>" amid the sounds of a physical struggle in the cockpit. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> radio transmission, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">35 seconds</TIMEX> later, indicated that the fight was continuing. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">captain</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> could be heard shouting:" <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hey</ENAMEX> get out of here-get out of here-get out of here."

    On <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX>, there were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 37</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">United 93-33</ENAMEX> in addition to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> hijackers. This was below the norm for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">mornings</TIMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer of 2001</TIMEX>. But there is no evidence that the hijackers manipulated passenger levels or purchased <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">additional</NUMEX> seats to facilitate their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX>.

    The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX> who hijacked <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> other commercial flights on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX> operated in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>-man <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">teams</ENAMEX>. They initiated their cockpit takeover within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 minutes</TIMEX> of takeoff. On <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Flight 93</ENAMEX>, however, the takeover took place <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">46 minutes</TIMEX> after takeoff and there were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only four</NUMEX> hijackers. The operative likely intended to round out the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> for this flight, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mohamed al Kahtani</ENAMEX>, had been refused entry by a suspicious immigration <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inspector</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Orlando International Airport</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August</TIMEX>.

    Because several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United 93</ENAMEX> described <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> hijackers on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX>, not <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>, some have wondered whether one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hijackers</ENAMEX> had been able to use the cockpit jump seat from the outset of the flight. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> rules allow use of this seat by documented and approved <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>, usually air <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carrier</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX>. We have found no evidence indicating that one of the hijackers, or anyone else, sat there on this flight. All the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hijackers</ENAMEX> had assigned seats in <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> class, and they seem to have used them. We believe it is more likely that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jarrah</ENAMEX>, the crucial pilot-trained <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX>, remained seated and inconspicuous until after the cockpit was seized; and once inside, he would not have been visible to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX>.

    At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:32</TIMEX>, a hijacker, probably <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jarrah</ENAMEX>, made or attempted to make the following announcement to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Flight 93</ENAMEX>:"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Ladies and Gentlemen: Here the captain</ENAMEX>, please sit down keep remaining sitting. We have a bomb on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX>. So, sit." The flight data recorder (also recovered) indicates that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jarrah</ENAMEX> then instructed the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX>'s autopilot to turn the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> around and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> east.

    The cockpit voice recorder data indicate that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX>, most likely a flight attendant, was being held captive in the cockpit. She struggled with one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hijackers</ENAMEX> who killed or otherwise silenced her.

    Shortly thereafter, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> and flight <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crew</ENAMEX> began a series of calls from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTE</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">airphones</ENAMEX> and cellular phones. These calls between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> took place until the end of the flight and provided those on the ground with firsthand accounts. They enabled the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> to gain critical information, including the news that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> had slammed into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Trade Center</ENAMEX>.

    At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:39</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cleveland</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Route Traffic Control Center</ENAMEX> overheard a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> announcement indicating that there was a bomb on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX>, that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> was returning to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX>, and that they should remain seated.

    While it apparently was not heard by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX>, this announcement, like those on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Flight 11</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Flight 77</ENAMEX>, was intended to deceive them. Jarrah, like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX>, may have inadvertently broadcast the message because he did not know how to operate the radio and the intercom. To our knowledge none of them had ever flown an actual airliner before.

    <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">At least two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">callers</ENAMEX> from the flight reported that the hijackers knew that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> were making calls but did not seem to care. It is quite possible <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jarrah</ENAMEX> knew of the success of the assault on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Trade Center</ENAMEX>. He could have learned of this from messages being sent by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Airlines</ENAMEX> to the cockpits of its transcontinental flights, including <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Flight 93</ENAMEX>, warning of cockpit intrusion and telling of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> attacks. But even without them, he would certainly have understood that the attacks on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Trade Center</ENAMEX> would already have unfolded, given <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Flight 93</ENAMEX>'s tardy departure from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Newark</ENAMEX>. If <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jarrah</ENAMEX> did know that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> were making calls, it might not have occurred to him that they were certain to learn what had happened in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>, thereby defeating his attempts at deception.

    At least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> crew <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> shared vital information with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX>, or others on the ground. All understood the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> had been hijacked. They said the hijackers wielded knives and claimed to have a bomb. The hijackers were wearing red bandanas, and they forced the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> to the back of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>.

    <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Callers</ENAMEX> reported that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passenger</ENAMEX> had been stabbed and that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> were lying on the floor of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cabin</ENAMEX>, injured or dead-possibly the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">captain</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">caller</ENAMEX> reported that a flight attendant had been killed.

    <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">callers</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">United 93</ENAMEX> also reported that he thought the hijackers might possess a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">gun</ENAMEX>. But none of the other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">callers</ENAMEX> reported the presence of a firearm. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipient</ENAMEX> of a call from the aircraft recounted specifically asking her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">caller</ENAMEX> whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hijackers</ENAMEX> had <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX>. The passenger replied that he did not see <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>. No evidence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">firearms</ENAMEX> or of their identifiable remains was found at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>'s crash site, and the cockpit voice recorder gives no indication of a gun being fired or mentioned at any time. We believe that if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hijackers</ENAMEX> had possessed a gun, they would have used it in the flight's <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">last minutes</TIMEX> as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> fought back.

    <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Passengers</ENAMEX> on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> flights reported the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hijackers</ENAMEX>' claim of having a bomb. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> told us they found no trace of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">explosives</ENAMEX> at the crash sites. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> who mentioned a bomb expressed his belief that it was not real. Lacking any evidence that the hijackers attempted to smuggle such illegal items past the security screening <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">checkpoints</ENAMEX>, we believe the bombs were probably fake.

    During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least five</TIMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX>' phone calls, information was shared about the attacks that had occurred <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> that <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Trade Center</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Five</NUMEX> calls described the intent of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> and surviving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crew members</ENAMEX> to revolt against the hijackers. According to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> call, they voted on whether to rush the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX> in an attempt to retake the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX>. They decided, and acted.

    At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:57</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passenger</ENAMEX> assault began. Several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> had terminated phone calls with loved ones in order to join the revolt. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">callers</ENAMEX> ended her message as follows:"Everyone's running up to <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> class. I've got to go. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bye</ENAMEX>."

    The cockpit voice recorder captured the sounds of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passenger</ENAMEX> assault muffled by the intervening cockpit door. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family members</ENAMEX> who listened to the recording report that they can hear the voice of a loved <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> among the din. We cannot identify whose voices can be heard. But the assault was sustained.

    In response, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jarrah</ENAMEX> immediately began to roll the airplane to the left and right, attempting to knock the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> off balance. At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:58:57</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jarrah</ENAMEX> told another hijacker in the cockpit to block the door. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jarrah</ENAMEX> continued to roll the airplane sharply left and right, but the assault continued. At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:59:52</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jarrah</ENAMEX> changed tactics and pitched the nose of the airplane up and down to disrupt the assault. The recorder captured the sounds of loud thumps, crashes, shouts, and breaking glasses and plates. At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10:00:03</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jarrah</ENAMEX> stabilized the airplane.

    <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Five seconds</TIMEX> later, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jarrah</ENAMEX> asked, "Is that it? Shall we finish it off?"A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hijacker</ENAMEX> responded,"No. Not yet. When they all come, we finish it off." The sounds of fighting continued outside the cockpit. Again, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jarrah</ENAMEX> pitched the nose of the aircraft up and down. At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10:00:26</TIMEX>, a passenger in the background said,"In the cockpit. If we don't we'll die!" <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Sixteen seconds</TIMEX> later, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passenger</ENAMEX> yelled,"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Roll it</ENAMEX>!" <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jarrah</ENAMEX> stopped the violent maneuvers at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 10:01:00</TIMEX> and said,"<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allah</ENAMEX> is the greatest! <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Allah</ENAMEX> is the greatest!" He then asked another hijacker in the cockpit," Is that it? I mean, shall we put it down?" to which the other replied,"Yes, put it in it, and pull it down."

    The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> continued their assault and at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10:02:23</TIMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hijacker</ENAMEX> said, "Pull it down! Pull it down!"The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hijackers</ENAMEX> remained at the controls but must have judged that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> were <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">only seconds</TIMEX> from overcoming them. The airplane headed down; the control wheel was turned hard to the right. The airplane rolled onto its back, and one of the hijackers began shouting "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allah</ENAMEX> is the greatest. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Allah</ENAMEX> is the greatest." With the sounds of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passenger</ENAMEX> counterattack continuing, the aircraft plowed into an empty <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">field</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shanksville</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX>, at <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">580 miles per hour</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 20 minutes</TIMEX>' flying time from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">D.C.</ENAMEX>

    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jarrah</ENAMEX>'s objective was to crash his airliner into symbols of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Republic</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Capitol</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>. He was defeated by the alerted, unarmed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX> 93.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMPROVISING A HOMELAND DEFENSE</ENAMEX>

The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> and NORAD

    On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9/11</TIMEX>, the defense of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> airspace depended on close interaction between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>: the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North American Aerospace Defense Command</ENAMEX> (NORAD). The most recent hijacking that involved <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> air traffic controllers, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>, and military coordination had occurred in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1993.90</NUMEX> In order to understand how the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> interacted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eight years later</TIMEX>, we will review their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">missions</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">command</ENAMEX> and control <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX>, and working relationship on <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX>.

    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA Mission</ENAMEX> and Structure. As of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 11, 2001</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> was mandated by law to regulate the safety and security of civil aviation. From an air traffic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">controller</ENAMEX>'s perspective, that meant maintaining a safe distance between airborne <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>.

    Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">controllers</ENAMEX> work at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Route Traffic Control Centers</ENAMEX>. They are grouped under regional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> and coordinate closely with the national <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Traffic Control System Command Center</ENAMEX>, located in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Herndon</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX>, which oversees <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> traffic flow within the entire airspace system. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX> is ultimately responsible for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Airspace System</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Operations Center</ENAMEX> located at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX> receives notifications of incidents, including accidents and hijackings.

    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA Control Centers</ENAMEX> often receive information and make operational decisions independently of one another. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9/11</TIMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> hijacked <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> were monitored mainly by the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cleveland</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indianapolis</ENAMEX>. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> thus had part of the knowledge of what was going on across the system. What <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boston</ENAMEX> knew was not necessarily known by <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cleveland</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indianapolis</ENAMEX>, or for that matter by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Command Center</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Herndon</ENAMEX> or by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>.

    Controllers track <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">airliners</ENAMEX> such as the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> aircraft hijacked on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9/11</TIMEX> primarily by watching the data from a signal emitted by each <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>'s transponder equipment. Those <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX>, like all <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> traveling above <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10,000 feet</NUMEX>, were required to emit a unique transponder signal while in flight.

    On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9/11</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX> turned off the transponders on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> hijacked <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>. With its transponder off, it is possible, though more difficult, to track an aircraft by its primary radar returns. But unlike transponder data, primary radar returns do not show the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>'s identity and altitude. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Controllers</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> rely so heavily on transponder signals that they usually do not display primary radar returns on their radar <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">scopes</ENAMEX>. But they can change the configuration of their scopes so they can see primary radar returns. They did this on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9/11</TIMEX> when the transponder signals for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> disappeared.

    Before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9/11</TIMEX>, it was not unheard of for a commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> to deviate slightly from its course, or for an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">controller</ENAMEX> to lose radio contact with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a short period of time</TIMEX>. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">controller</ENAMEX> could also briefly lose a commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>'s transponder signal, although this happened much less frequently. However, the simultaneous loss of radio and transponder signal would be a rare and alarming occurrence, and would normally indicate a catastrophic system failure or an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> crash. In all of these instances, the job of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">controller</ENAMEX> was to reach out to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>, the parent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>, and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX> in the vicinity in an attempt to reestablish communications and set the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> back on course. Alarm bells would not start ringing until these efforts-which could take <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five minutes</TIMEX> or more-were tried and had failed.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NORAD Mission</ENAMEX> and Structure. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NORAD</ENAMEX> is a binational <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">command</ENAMEX> established in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1958</TIMEX> between the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>. Its mission was, and is, to defend the airspace of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North America</ENAMEX> and protect the continent. That mission does not distinguish between internal and external threats; but because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NORAD</ENAMEX> was created to counter the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> threat, it came to define its job as defending against external attacks.

    The threat of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bombers</ENAMEX> diminished significantly as the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Cold War</ENAMEX> ended, and the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NORAD</ENAMEX> alert <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> was reduced from its <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Cold War</ENAMEX> high of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX>. Some within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> argued in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1990s</TIMEX> that the alert <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> should be eliminated entirely. In an effort to preserve their mission, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the air defense <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> advocated the importance of air sovereignty against emerging "asymmetric threats" to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> smuggling, "non-state and state-sponsored <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX>," and the proliferation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX> of mass destruction and ballistic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missile</ENAMEX> technology.

    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NORAD</ENAMEX> perceived the dominant threat to be from cruise <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missiles</ENAMEX>. Other threats were identified during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 1990s</TIMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX>' use of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX>. Exercises were conducted to counter this threat, but they were not based on actual intelligence. In most instances, the main <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> was the use of such <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> to deliver <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX> of mass destruction.

    Prior to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX>, it was understood that an order to shoot down a commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> would have to be issued by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Command Authority</ENAMEX> (a phrase used to describe the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX> of defense). Exercise <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planners</ENAMEX> also assumed that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> would originate from outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, allowing time to identify the target and scramble interceptors. The threat of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX> hijacking commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">airliners</ENAMEX> within the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>-and using them as guided <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missiles</ENAMEX>-was not recognized by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NORAD</ENAMEX> before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9/11</TIMEX>. Notwithstanding the identification of these emerging threats, by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9/11</TIMEX> there were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only seven</NUMEX> alert sites left in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, each with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">fighter aircraft</ENAMEX> on alert. This led some NORAD <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commanders</ENAMEX> to worry that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NORAD</ENAMEX> was not postured adequately to protect the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>.

    In the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NORAD</ENAMEX> is divided into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sectors</ENAMEX>. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9/11</TIMEX>, all the hijacked <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> were in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NORAD</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northeast Air Defense Sector</ENAMEX> (also known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEADS</ENAMEX>), which is based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>. That <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> NEADS could call on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> alert sites, each with one pair of ready <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fighters</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Otis Air National Guard</ENAMEX> Base in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cape Cod</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Massachusetts</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Langley Air Force Base</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hampton</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX>.

    Other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX>, not on "alert," would need time to arm the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fighters</ENAMEX> and organize <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crews</ENAMEX>.

    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEADS</ENAMEX> reported to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Continental U.S. NORAD Region</ENAMEX> (CONR) <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Panama City</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX>, which in turn reported to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NORAD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colorado Springs</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colorado</ENAMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Interagency Collaboration</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NORAD</ENAMEX> had developed protocols for working together in the event of a hijacking. As they existed on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9/11</TIMEX>, the protocols for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> to obtain military assistance from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NORAD</ENAMEX> required multiple levels of notification and approval at the highest levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>.

    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> guidance to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">controllers</ENAMEX> on hijack procedures assumed that the aircraft <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot</ENAMEX> would notify the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">controller</ENAMEX> via radio or by"squawking"a transponder code of "<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7500</TIMEX>"-the universal code for a hijack in progress. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Controllers</ENAMEX> would notify their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supervisors</ENAMEX>, who in turn would inform <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> all the way up to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Headquarters</ENAMEX> had a hijack <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coordinator</ENAMEX>, who was the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA Office of Civil Aviation Security</ENAMEX> or his or her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designate</ENAMEX>.

    If a hijack was confirmed, procedures called for the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hijack</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coordinator</ENAMEX> on duty to contact the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Military Command Center</ENAMEX> (NMCC) and to ask for a military <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">escort aircraft</ENAMEX> to follow the flight, report anything unusual, and aid search and rescue in the event of an emergency. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NMCC</ENAMEX> would then seek approval from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense</ENAMEX> to provide military assistance. If approval was given, the orders would be transmitted down <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NORAD</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">command</ENAMEX>.

    The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NMCC</ENAMEX> would keep the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> hijack <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coordinator</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">up to date</TIMEX> and help the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> centers coordinate directly with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">military</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NORAD</ENAMEX> would receive tracking information for the hijacked aircraft either from joint use radar or from the relevant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> air traffic control <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX>. Every attempt would be made to have the hijacked <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> squawk <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7500</TIMEX> to help <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NORAD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">track</ENAMEX> it.

    The protocols did not contemplate an intercept. They assumed the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fighter escort</ENAMEX> would be discreet, "vectored to a position <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">five miles</NUMEX> directly behind the hijacked <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>," where it could perform its mission to monitor the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>'s flight path.

    In sum, the protocols in place on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NORAD</ENAMEX> to respond to a hijacking presumed that


the hijacked <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> would be readily identifiable and would not attempt to disappear;

there would be time to address the problem through the appropriate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NORAD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">command</ENAMEX>; and

the hijacking would take the traditional form: that is, it would not be a suicide hijacking designed to convert the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> into a guided <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missile</ENAMEX>.


    On <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX>, the existing protocol was unsuited in every respect for what was about to happen.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Airlines</ENAMEX> Flight <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA Awareness</ENAMEX>. Although the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boston Center</ENAMEX> air traffic controller realized at an early stage that there was something wrong with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>, he did not immediately interpret the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX>'s failure to respond as a sign that it had been hijacked. At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:14</TIMEX>, when the flight failed to heed his instruction to climb to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">35,000 feet</NUMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">controller</ENAMEX> repeatedly tried to raise the flight. He reached out to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot</ENAMEX> on the emergency frequency. Though there was no response, he kept trying to contact the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>.

    At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:21</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American 11</ENAMEX> turned off its transponder, immediately degrading the information available about the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">controller</ENAMEX> told his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supervisor</ENAMEX> that he thought something was seriously wrong with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX>, although neither suspected a hijacking. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supervisor</ENAMEX> instructed the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">controller</ENAMEX> to follow standard procedures for handling a "no radio" <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>.

    The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">controller</ENAMEX> checked to see if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Airlines</ENAMEX> could establish communication with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>. He became even more concerned as its route changed, moving into another sector's airspace. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Controllers</ENAMEX> immediately began to move <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> out of its path, and asked other <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> in the vicinity to look for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> 11.

    At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:24:38</TIMEX>, the following transmission came from <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">American 11: American 11:</ENAMEX> We have some <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX>. Just stay quiet, and you'll be okay. We are returning to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX>.

    The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">controller</ENAMEX> only heard something unintelligible; he did not hear the specific words "we have some <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX>." The next transmission came <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">seconds</TIMEX> later: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American 11</ENAMEX>: Nobody move. Everything will be okay. If you try to make any moves, you'll endanger yourself and the airplane. Just stay quiet.

    The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">controller</ENAMEX> told us that he then knew it was a hijacking. He alerted his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supervisor</ENAMEX>, who assigned another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">controller</ENAMEX> to assist him. He redoubled his efforts to ascertain the flight's altitude. Because the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">controller</ENAMEX> didn't understand the initial transmission, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boston Center</ENAMEX> instructed his quality assurance <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialist</ENAMEX> to "pull the tape" of the radio transmission, listen to it closely, and report back.

    Between <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:25 and 8:32</TIMEX>, in accordance with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> protocol, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boston Center</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> started notifying their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">command</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American 11</ENAMEX> had been hijacked. At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:28</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boston Center</ENAMEX> called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Command Center</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Herndon</ENAMEX> to advise that it believed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American 11</ENAMEX> had been hijacked and was heading toward <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Center</ENAMEX>'s airspace.

    By <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this time</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American 11</ENAMEX> had taken a dramatic turn to the south. At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:32</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Command Center</ENAMEX> passed word of a possible hijacking to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Operations Center</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX>. The duty <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> replied that security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX> had just begun discussing the apparent hijack on a conference call with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New England</ENAMEX> regional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX> began to follow the hijack protocol but did not contact the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NMCC</ENAMEX> to request a fighter <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">escort</ENAMEX>.

    The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Herndon Command Center</ENAMEX> immediately established a teleconference between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cleveland Centers</ENAMEX> so that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boston Center</ENAMEX> could help the others understand what was happening.

    At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:34</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boston Center</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">controller</ENAMEX> received a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> transmission from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>:

    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American 11</ENAMEX>: Nobody move please. We are going back to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX>. Don't try to make any stupid moves.

    In the succeeding <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">controllers</ENAMEX> were attempting to ascertain the altitude of the southbound flight.

Military Notification and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Response</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boston Center</ENAMEX> did not follow the protocol in seeking military assistance through the prescribed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">command</ENAMEX>. In addition to notifications within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boston Center</ENAMEX> took the initiative, at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:34</TIMEX>, to contact the military through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cape Cod</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">center</ENAMEX> also tried to contact a former alert site in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Atlantic City</ENAMEX>, unaware it had been phased out. At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:37:52</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boston Center</ENAMEX> reached <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEADS</ENAMEX>. This was the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> notification received by the military-at any level-that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American 11</ENAMEX> had been hijacked:

    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hi</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boston Center TMU</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Traffic Management</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Unit</ENAMEX>], we have a problem here. We have a hijacked <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> headed towards <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>, and we need you <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> to, we need someone to scramble some <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-16s</ENAMEX> or something up there, help us out.

    NEADS: Is this real-world or exercise?

    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>: No, this is not an exercise, not a test. 

    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEADS</ENAMEX> ordered to battle stations the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-15 alert</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Otis Air Force Base</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Falmouth</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Massachusetts</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">153 miles</NUMEX> away from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York City</ENAMEX>. The air defense of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> began with this call.

    At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEADS</ENAMEX>, the report of the hijacking was relayed immediately to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Battle</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Commander Colonel</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Marr</ENAMEX>. After ordering the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Otis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">fighters</ENAMEX> to battle <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stations</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Colonel</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marr</ENAMEX> phoned <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Major General</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry Arnold</ENAMEX>, commanding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">general</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Air Force</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NORAD</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Continental Region</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marr</ENAMEX> sought authorization to scramble the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Otis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">fighters</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Arnold</ENAMEX> later recalled instructing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marr</ENAMEX> to "go ahead and scramble them, and we'll get <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> later." <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Arnold</ENAMEX> then called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NORAD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX> to report. 

    <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-15</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">fighters</ENAMEX> were scrambled at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:46</TIMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Otis Air Force Base</ENAMEX>. But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEADS</ENAMEX> did not know where to send the alert fighter <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> directing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fighters</ENAMEX> pressed for more information:"I don't know where I'm scrambling these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> to. I need a direction, a destination." Because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hijackers</ENAMEX> had turned off the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX>'s transponder, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEADS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> spent <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the next minutes</TIMEX> searching their radar <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">scopes</ENAMEX> for the primary radar return. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American 11</ENAMEX> struck the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NorthTower</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:46</TIMEX>. Shortly after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:50</TIMEX>, while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEADS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> were still trying to locate the flight, word reached them that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> had hit the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Trade Center</ENAMEX>. 

    Radar data show the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Otis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">fighters</ENAMEX> were airborne at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:53</TIMEX>. Lacking a target, they were vectored toward military-controlled airspace off the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Long Island</ENAMEX> coast. To avoid <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> area air traffic and uncertain about what to do, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fighters</ENAMEX> were brought down to military airspace to "hold as needed." From <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:09 to 9:13</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Otis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fighters</ENAMEX> stayed in this holding pattern.

    In summary, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEADS</ENAMEX> received notice of the hijacking <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">nine minutes</TIMEX> before it struck the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North Tower</ENAMEX>. That <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">nine minutes</TIMEX>' notice before impact was the most the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">military</ENAMEX> would receive of any of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> hijackings. 

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Airlines</ENAMEX> Flight 175 
	
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA Awareness</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the last transmissions from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Airlines</ENAMEX> Flight 175 is, in retrospect, chilling. By <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:40</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">controllers</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">New York Center</ENAMEX> were seeking information on <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>. At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">approximately 8:42</TIMEX>, shortly after entering <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Center</ENAMEX>'s airspace, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United 175</ENAMEX> broke in with the following transmission:

    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> 175: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York UAL</ENAMEX> 175 heavy.

    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> 175 go ahead.

    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAL</ENAMEX> 175: Yeah. We figured we'd wait to go to your <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>. Ah, we heard a suspicious transmission on our departure out of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX>, ah, with someone, ah, it sounded like someone keyed the mikes and said ah everyone ah stay in your seats.

    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>: Oh, okay. I'll pass that along over here.

    <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Minutes</TIMEX> later, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United 175</ENAMEX> turned southwest without clearance from air traffic control. At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:47, seconds</TIMEX> after the impact of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United 175</ENAMEX>'s transponder code changed, and then changed again. These changes were not noticed for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">several minutes</TIMEX>, however, because the same <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Center</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">controller</ENAMEX> was assigned to both <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United 175</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">controller</ENAMEX> knew <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> was hijacked; he was focused on searching for it after the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> disappeared at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:46</TIMEX>.

    At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:48</TIMEX>, while the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">controller</ENAMEX> was still trying to locate <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Center</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> provided the following report on a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Command Center</ENAMEX> teleconference about <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>:

    <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Manager</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Center</ENAMEX>: Okay. This is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Center</ENAMEX>. We're watching the airplane. I also had conversation with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Airlines</ENAMEX>, and they've told us that they believe that one of their stewardesses was stabbed and that there are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in the cockpit that have control of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>, and that's all the information they have right now.

    The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Center</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">controller</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> were unaware that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American 11</ENAMEX> had already crashed.

    At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:51</TIMEX>, the controller noticed the transponder change from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United 175</ENAMEX> and tried to contact the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>. There was no response. Beginning at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:52</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">controller</ENAMEX> made repeated attempts to reach the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crew</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United 175</ENAMEX>. Still no response. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">controller</ENAMEX> checked his radio equipment and contacted another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">controller</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:53</TIMEX>, saying that "we may have a hijack" and that he could not find the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>.

    Another commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> in the vicinity then radioed in with "reports over the radio of a commuter <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> hitting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Trade Center</ENAMEX>." The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">controller</ENAMEX> spent <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the next several minutes</TIMEX> handing off the other flights on his scope to other controllers and moving <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> out of the way of the unidentified <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> (believed to be <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United 175</ENAMEX>) as it moved southwest and then turned northeast toward <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York City</ENAMEX>.

    At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 8:55</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">controller</ENAMEX> in charge notified a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Center</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> that she believed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United 175</ENAMEX> had also been hijacked. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> tried to notify the regional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> and was told that they were discussing a hijacked <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> (presumably <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American 11</ENAMEX>) and refused to be disturbed. At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:58</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Center</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">controller</ENAMEX> searching for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United 175</ENAMEX> told another <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">controller</ENAMEX> "we might have a hijack over here, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of them."

    Between <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:01 and 9:02</TIMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Center</ENAMEX> told the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Command Center</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Herndon</ENAMEX>:

    <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Manager</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Center</ENAMEX>: We have several situations going on here. It's escalating big, big time. We need to get the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">military</ENAMEX> involved with us. . . . We're, we're involved with something else, we have other <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> that may have a similar situation going on here.

    The "other <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>" referred to by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Center</ENAMEX> was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United 175</ENAMEX>. Evidence indicates that this conversation was the only notice received by either <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Herndon Command Center</ENAMEX> prior to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> crash that there had been a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> hijacking.

    While the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Command Center</ENAMEX> was told about this "other <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>" at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:01</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Center</ENAMEX> contacted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York</ENAMEX> terminal approach control and asked for help in locating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX> 175.

    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Terminal</ENAMEX>: I got somebody who keeps coasting but it looks like he's going into one of the small <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airports</ENAMEX> down there.

    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center</ENAMEX>: Hold on a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>. I'm trying to bring him up here and get you-There he is right there. Hold on.

    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Terminal</ENAMEX>: Got him just out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9,500</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9,000</NUMEX> now.

    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center</ENAMEX>: Do you know who he is?

    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Terminal</ENAMEX>: We're just, we just we don't know who he is. We're just picking him up <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">now</TIMEX>.

    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center</ENAMEX> (at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:02</TIMEX>): <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alright</ENAMEX>. Heads up <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>, it looks like another <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> coming in.

    The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">controllers</ENAMEX> observed the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> in a rapid descent; the radar data terminated over <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lower Manhattan</ENAMEX>. At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:03</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United 175</ENAMEX> crashed into the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">South Tower</ENAMEX>.

    Meanwhile, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boston Center</ENAMEX> reported that they had deciphered what they had heard in one of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> hijacker transmissions from <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boston Center</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hey</ENAMEX> . . . you still there?

    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New England Region</ENAMEX>: Yes, I am.

    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boston Center</ENAMEX>: . . . as far as the tape, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bobby</ENAMEX> seemed to think the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> said that "we have planes." Now, I don't know if it was because it was the accent, or if there's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX>, but I'm gonna, I'm gonna reconfirm that for you, and I'll get back to you real quick. Okay? <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New England Region</ENAMEX>: Appreciate it.

    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unidentified Female Voice</ENAMEX>: They have what?

    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boston Center</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Planes</ENAMEX>, as in plural.

    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boston Center</ENAMEX>: It sounds like, we're talking to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>, that there's another one aimed at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Trade Center</ENAMEX>.

    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New England Region</ENAMEX>: There's another <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>?

    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boston Center</ENAMEX>: A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> one just hit the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Trade Center</ENAMEX>.

    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New England Region</ENAMEX>: Okay. Yeah, we gotta get-we gotta alert the military real quick on this.

    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boston Center</ENAMEX> immediately advised the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New England Region</ENAMEX> that it was going to stop all departures at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airports</ENAMEX> under its control. At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:05</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boston Center</ENAMEX> confirmed for both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA Command Center</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New England Region</ENAMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hijackers</ENAMEX> aboard <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American 11</ENAMEX> said "we have planes." At the same time, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Center</ENAMEX> declared "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATC</ENAMEX> zero"-meaning that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> were not permitted to depart from, arrive at, or travel through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Center</ENAMEX>'s airspace until further notice.

    Within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> of the second impact, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boston Center</ENAMEX> instructed its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">controllers</ENAMEX> to inform all <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> in its airspace of the events in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> and to advise <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> to heighten cockpit security. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boston Center</ENAMEX> asked the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Herndon Command Center</ENAMEX> to issue a similar cockpit security alert nationwide. We have found no evidence to suggest that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Command Center</ENAMEX> acted on this request or issued any type of cockpit security alert.

Military Notification and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Response</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> indication that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NORAD</ENAMEX> air <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defenders</ENAMEX> had of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">hijacked aircraft</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United 175</ENAMEX>, came in a phone call from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Center</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEADS</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:03</TIMEX>. The notice came at about the time the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> was hitting the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">South Tower</ENAMEX>.

    By <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:08</TIMEX>, the mission crew <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commander</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEADS</ENAMEX> learned of the second explosion at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Trade Center</ENAMEX> and decided against holding the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fighters</ENAMEX> in military airspace away from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manhattan</ENAMEX>:

    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mission</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Crew</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Commander</ENAMEX>, NEADS: This is what I foresee that we probably need to do. We need to talk to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>. We need to tell 'em if this stuff is gonna keep on going, we need to take those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fighters</ENAMEX>, put 'em over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manhattan</ENAMEX>. That's best thing, that's the best play right now. So coordinate with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>. Tell 'em if there's more out there, which we don't know, let's get 'em over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manhattan</ENAMEX>. At least we got some kind of play.

    The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> cleared the airspace. Radar data show that at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:13</TIMEX>, when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Otis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">fighters</ENAMEX> were <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 115 miles</NUMEX> away from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fighters</ENAMEX> exited their holding pattern and set a course direct for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manhattan</ENAMEX>. They arrived at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:25</TIMEX> and established a combat air <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">patrol</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAP</ENAMEX>) over the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>.

    Because the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Otis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">fighters</ENAMEX> had expended a great deal of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fuel</ENAMEX> in flying <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> to military airspace and then to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>, the battle <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commanders</ENAMEX> were concerned about refueling. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEADS</ENAMEX> considered scrambling alert <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fighters</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Langley Air Force Base</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>, to provide backup. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Langley</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">fighters</ENAMEX> were placed on battle <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stations</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:09.137 NORAD</TIMEX> had no indication that any other <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> had been hijacked.

    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Airlines</ENAMEX> Flight <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">77</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA Awareness</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American 77</ENAMEX> began deviating from its flight plan at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:54</TIMEX>, with a slight turn toward the south. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Two minutes</TIMEX> later, it disappeared completely from radar at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Indianapolis Center</ENAMEX>, which was controlling the flight.

    The controller tracking <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">77</TIMEX> told us he noticed the aircraft turning to the southwest, and then saw the data disappear. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">controller</ENAMEX> looked for primary radar returns. He searched along the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX>'s projected flight path and the airspace to the southwest where it had started to turn. No primary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> appeared. He tried the radios, first calling the aircraft directly, then the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">airline</ENAMEX>. Again there was nothing. At this point, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indianapolis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">controller</ENAMEX> had no knowledge of the situation in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>. He did not know that other <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> had been hijacked. He believed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American 77</ENAMEX> had experienced serious electrical or mechanical failure, or both, and was gone.

    Shortly after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:00</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indianapolis Center</ENAMEX> started notifying other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">77</TIMEX> was missing and had possibly crashed. At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:08</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Indianapolis Center</ENAMEX> asked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force Search</ENAMEX> and Rescue at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Langley Air Force Base</ENAMEX> to look for a downed <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">center</ENAMEX> also contacted the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Virginia</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Police</ENAMEX> and asked whether any reports of a downed <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> had been received. At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:09</TIMEX>, it reported the loss of contact to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> regional <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, which passed this information to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:24</TIMEX>.

    By <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:20</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Indianapolis Center</ENAMEX> learned that there were other hijacked <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>, and began to doubt its initial assumption that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American 77</ENAMEX> had crashed. A discussion of this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> between the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indianapolis</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Command Center</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Herndon</ENAMEX> prompted it to notify some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> field <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">77</TIMEX> was lost. By <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:21</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Command Center</ENAMEX>, some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> field <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Airlines</ENAMEX> had started to search for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">77</TIMEX>. They feared it had been hijacked. At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:25</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Command Center</ENAMEX> advised <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX> of the situation.

    The failure to find a primary radar return for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American 77</ENAMEX> led us to investigate this issue further. Radar reconstructions performed after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX> reveal that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> radar equipment tracked the flight from the moment its transponder was turned off at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:56</TIMEX>. But for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8 minutes and 13 seconds</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">between 8:56 and 9:05</TIMEX>, this primary radar information on <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">77</TIMEX> was not displayed to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">controllers</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Indianapolis Center</ENAMEX>.

    The reasons are technical, arising from the way the software processed radar information, as well as from poor primary radar coverage where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American 77</ENAMEX> was flying.

    According to the radar reconstruction, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">77</TIMEX> reemerged as a primary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Indianapolis Center</ENAMEX> radar <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">scopes</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:05</TIMEX>, east of its last known position. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX> remained in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Indianapolis Center</ENAMEX>'s airspace for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">another six minutes</TIMEX>, then crossed into the western portion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Center</ENAMEX>'s airspace at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:10</TIMEX>. As <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indianapolis Center</ENAMEX> continued searching for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">controller</ENAMEX> responsible for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">77</TIMEX> looked to the west and southwest along the flight's projected path, not east-where the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> was now heading. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Managers</ENAMEX> did not instruct other controllers at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Indianapolis Center</ENAMEX> to turn on their primary radar coverage to join in the search for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> 77.

    In sum, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indianapolis Center</ENAMEX> never saw Flight <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">77</NUMEX> turn around. By the time it reappeared in primary radar coverage, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">controllers</ENAMEX> had either stopped looking for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> because they thought it had crashed or were looking toward the west. Although the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Command Center</ENAMEX> learned <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Flight 77</ENAMEX> was missing, neither it nor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX> issued an all points bulletin to surrounding <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> to search for primary radar targets. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American 77</ENAMEX> traveled undetected for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">36 minutes</TIMEX> on a course heading due east for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">D.C.</ENAMEX>

    By <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:25</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Herndon Command Center</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX> knew <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> had crashed into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Trade Center</ENAMEX>. They knew <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">77</TIMEX> was lost. At least some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boston Center</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New England Region</ENAMEX> knew that a hijacker on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">board American 11</ENAMEX> had said "we have some <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX>." Concerns over the safety of other <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> began to mount. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Herndon Command Center</ENAMEX> asked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX> if they wanted to order a "nationwide ground stop." While this was being discussed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Command Center</ENAMEX> ordered <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:25</TIMEX>.

    The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Command Center</ENAMEX> kept looking for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">77</TIMEX>. At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:21</TIMEX>, it advised the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dulles</ENAMEX> terminal control <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dulles</ENAMEX> urged its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">controllers</ENAMEX> to look for primary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX>. At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:32</TIMEX>, they found <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>. Several of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dulles</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">controllers</ENAMEX> "observed a primary radar target tracking eastbound at a high rate of speed" and notified <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Reagan National Airport</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> at both <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dulles</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airports</ENAMEX> notified the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Secret Service</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>'s identity or type was unknown.

    <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">National controllers</ENAMEX> then vectored an unarmed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Guard</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C- 130H</ENAMEX> cargo <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>, which had just taken off en route to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minnesota</ENAMEX>, to identify and follow the suspicious <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-130H</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot</ENAMEX> spotted it, identified it as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">757</ENAMEX>, attempted to follow its path, and at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:38, seconds</TIMEX> after impact, reported to the control <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX>:"looks like that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> crashed into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> sir."

Military Notification and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Response</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NORAD</ENAMEX> heard nothing about the search for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">77</TIMEX>. Instead, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEADS</ENAMEX> air <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defenders</ENAMEX> heard renewed reports about a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> that no longer existed: <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> 11.

    At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:21</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEADS</ENAMEX> received a report from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Military, Boston Center</ENAMEX>. I just had a report that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American 11</ENAMEX> is still in the air, and it's on its way towards-heading towards <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>. NEADS: Okay. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American 11</ENAMEX> is still in the air?

    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>: Yes.

    NEADS: On its way towards <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>?

    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>: That was another-it was evidently another <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> that hit the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX>. That's the latest report we have.

    NEADS: Okay.

    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>: I'm going to try to confirm an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ID</ENAMEX> for you, but I would assume he's somewhere over, uh, either <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Jersey</ENAMEX> or somewhere further south.

    NEADS: Okay. So <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American 11</ENAMEX> isn't the hijack at all then, right? <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>: No, he is a hijack.

    NEADS: He-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> is a hijack?

    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>: Yes.

    NEADS: And he's heading into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>?

    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>: Yes. This could be a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>.

    The mention of a "<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>" was not a reference to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">77</TIMEX>. There was confusion at that moment in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX> had struck the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Trade Center</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boston Center</ENAMEX> had heard from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> was still airborne. We have been unable to identify the source of this mistaken <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> information.

    The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEADS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">technician</ENAMEX> who took this call from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> immediately passed the word to the mission crew <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commander</ENAMEX>, who reported to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NEADS</ENAMEX> battle <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commander</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mission Crew</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Commander</ENAMEX>, NEADS: Okay, uh, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Airlines</ENAMEX> is still airborne. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Eleven</NUMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX>, he's heading towards <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>. Okay? I think we need to scramble <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Langley</ENAMEX> right now. And I'm gonna take the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fighters</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Otis</ENAMEX>, try to chase this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX> down if I can find him.

    After consulting with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEADS</ENAMEX> command, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crew commander</ENAMEX> issued the order at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:23</TIMEX>:"Okay . . . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">scramble Langley</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Head</ENAMEX> them towards the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> area. . . . [I]f they're there then we'll run on them. . . . These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> are smart." That order was processed and transmitted to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Langley Air Force Base</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:24</TIMEX>. Radar data show the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Langley</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">fighters</ENAMEX> airborne at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:30</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEADS</ENAMEX> decided to keep the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Otis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">fighters</ENAMEX> over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>. The heading of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Langley</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">fighters</ENAMEX> was adjusted to send them to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baltimore</ENAMEX> area. The mission crew <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commander</ENAMEX> explained to us that the purpose was to position the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Langley</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">fighters</ENAMEX> between the reported southbound <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s capital.

    At the suggestion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boston Center</ENAMEX>'s military liaison, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEADS</ENAMEX> contacted the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Washington Center</ENAMEX> to ask about <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>. In the course of the conversation, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Center</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> informed NEADS:"We're looking- we also lost <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">77</TIMEX>." The time was <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:34</TIMEX>. This was the first notice to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">military</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">77</TIMEX> was missing, and it had come by chance. If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEADS</ENAMEX> had not placed that call, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEADS</ENAMEX> air <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defenders</ENAMEX> would have received no information whatsoever that the flight was even missing, although the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> had been searching for it. No one at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX> ever asked for military assistance with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> 77.

    At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:36</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boston Center</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEADS</ENAMEX> and relayed the discovery about an unidentified <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> closing in on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>:"Latest report. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aircraft VFR</ENAMEX> [visual flight rules] <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">six miles</NUMEX> southeast of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>. . . . <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Six</TIMEX>, southwest. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Six</TIMEX>, southwest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>, deviating away." This startling news prompted the mission crew <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commander</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEADS</ENAMEX> to take immediate control of the airspace to clear a flight path for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Langley</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">fighters</ENAMEX>:"Okay, we're going to turn it . . . crank it up. . . . Run them to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>." He then discovered, to his surprise, that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Langley</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">fighters</ENAMEX> were not headed north toward the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baltimore</ENAMEX> area as instructed, but east over the ocean." I don't care how many windows you break," he said." Damn it. . . . Okay. Push them back."

    The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Langley</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">fighters</ENAMEX> were heading east, not north, for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> reasons. First, unlike a normal scramble order, this order did not include a distance to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX>'s location. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, a "generic" flight plan-prepared to get the aircraft airborne and out of local airspace quickly-incorrectly led the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Langley</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">fighters</ENAMEX> to believe they were ordered to fly due east (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">090</ENAMEX>) for <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">60 miles</NUMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, the lead <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot</ENAMEX> and local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> controller incorrectly assumed the flight plan instruction to go "<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">090</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60</TIMEX>" superseded the original scramble order.

    After the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:36</TIMEX> call to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEADS</ENAMEX> about the unidentified <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a few miles</NUMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Langley</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">fighters</ENAMEX> were ordered to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">D.C. Controllers</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEADS</ENAMEX> located an unknown primary radar <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">track</ENAMEX>, but "it kind of faded" over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>. The time was <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:38</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> had been struck by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">77</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:37:46</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Langley</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">fighters</ENAMEX> were <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 150 miles</NUMEX> away.

    <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Right</TIMEX> after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> was hit, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEADS</ENAMEX> learned of another possible hijacked <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>. It was an aircraft that in fact had not been hijacked at all. After the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> World <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Trade Center</ENAMEX> crash, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boston Center</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> recognized that both <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> were transcontinental <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">767</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">jetliners</ENAMEX> that had departed <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Logan Airport</ENAMEX>. Remembering the "we have some <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX>" remark, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boston Center</ENAMEX> guessed that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1989</ENAMEX> might also be hijacked. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boston Center</ENAMEX> called NEADS at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:41</TIMEX> and identified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1989</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">767</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">jet</ENAMEX> that had left <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Logan Airport</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Vegas</ENAMEX>, as a possible hijack. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEADS</ENAMEX> warned the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cleveland Center</ENAMEX> to watch <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1989</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Command Center</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX> watched it too. During the course of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX>, there were multiple erroneous reports of hijacked <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>. The report of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> heading south was the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1989</ENAMEX> was the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>.

    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEADS</ENAMEX> never lost track of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1989</ENAMEX>, and even ordered fighter <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Michigan</ENAMEX> to intercept it. The flight never turned off its transponder. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEADS</ENAMEX> soon learned that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> was not hijacked, and tracked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1989</ENAMEX> as it reversed course over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toledo</ENAMEX>, headed east, and landed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cleveland</ENAMEX>.

    But another <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> was heading toward <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>, an aircraft about which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NORAD</ENAMEX> had heard nothing: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX> 93.

    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Airlines</ENAMEX> Flight <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">93</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA Awareness</ENAMEX>. At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:27</TIMEX>, after having been in the air for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">45 minutes</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United 93</ENAMEX> acknowledged a transmission from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cleveland Center</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">controller</ENAMEX>. This was the last normal contact the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> had with the flight.

    Less than <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a minute</TIMEX> later, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cleveland</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">controller</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> in the vicinity heard "a radio transmission of unintelligible sounds of possible screaming or a struggle from an unknown origin."

    The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">controller</ENAMEX> responded, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">seconds</TIMEX> later: "Somebody call <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cleveland</ENAMEX>?"This was followed by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a second</TIMEX> radio transmission, with sounds of screaming. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cleveland Center</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">controllers</ENAMEX> began to try to identify the possible source of the transmissions, and noticed that <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">United 93</ENAMEX> had descended <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">some 700 feet</NUMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">controller</ENAMEX> attempted again to raise <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX> 93 several times, with no response. At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:30</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">controller</ENAMEX> began to poll the other flights on his frequency to determine if they had heard the screaming; several said they had.

    At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:32</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a third</NUMEX> radio transmission came over the frequency:"Keep remaining sitting. We have a bomb on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX>." The controller understood, but chose to respond: "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calling Cleveland Center</ENAMEX>, you're unreadable. Say again, slowly." He notified his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supervisor</ENAMEX>, who passed the notice up the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">command</ENAMEX>. By <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:34</TIMEX>, word of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hijacking</ENAMEX> had reached <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX>.

    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX> had by this time established an open line of communication with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Command Center</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Herndon</ENAMEX> and instructed it to poll all its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> about suspect <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Command Center</ENAMEX> executed the request and, a minute later, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cleveland Center</ENAMEX> reported that "<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">United 93</ENAMEX> may have a bomb on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX>." At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:34</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Command Center</ENAMEX> relayed the information concerning <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">United 93</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX>. At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">approximately 9:36</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cleveland</ENAMEX> advised the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Command Center</ENAMEX> that it was still tracking <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">United 93</ENAMEX> and specifically inquired whether someone had requested the military to launch fighter <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> to intercept the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cleveland</ENAMEX> even told the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Command Center</ENAMEX> it was prepared to contact a nearby military <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base</ENAMEX> to make the request. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Command Center</ENAMEX> told <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cleveland</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> well above them in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">command</ENAMEX> had to make the decision to seek military assistance and were working on the issue.

    Between <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:34 and 9:38</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cleveland</ENAMEX> controller observed <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">United 93</ENAMEX> climbing to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">40,700 feet</NUMEX> and immediately moved <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> out its way. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">controller</ENAMEX> continued to try to contact <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">United 93</ENAMEX>, and asked whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot</ENAMEX> could confirm that he had been hijacked.

    There was no response.

    Then, at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:39</TIMEX>, a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> radio transmission was heard from <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">United 93</ENAMEX>: Ziad Jarrah: <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Uh</ENAMEX>, this is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">captain</ENAMEX>. Would like you all to remain seated. There is a bomb on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> and are going back to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX>, and to have our demands [unintelligible]. Please remain quiet.

    The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">controller</ENAMEX> responded: "<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">United 93</ENAMEX>, understand you have a bomb on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX>. Go ahead." The flight did not respond.

    From <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:34 to 10:08</TIMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Command Center</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">facility manager</ENAMEX> provided frequent updates to Acting Deputy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Administrator Monte Belger</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">United 93</ENAMEX> headed toward <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">D.C.</ENAMEX> At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:41</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cleveland Center</ENAMEX> lost <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">United 93</ENAMEX>'s transponder signal. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">controller</ENAMEX> located it on primary radar, matched its position with visual sightings from other <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>, and tracked the flight as it turned east, then south.

    At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:42</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Command Center</ENAMEX> learned from news reports that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> had struck the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Command Center</ENAMEX>'s national operations <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ben Sliney</ENAMEX>, ordered all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> to instruct all <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> to land at the nearest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX>. This was an unprecedented order. The air traffic control system handled it with great skill, as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 4,500</NUMEX> commercial and general aviation aircraft soon landed without incident.

    At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:46</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Command Center</ENAMEX> updated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">United 93</ENAMEX> was now "<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty-nine minutes</TIMEX> out of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">D.C.</ENAMEX>" At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:49, 13 minutes</TIMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cleveland Center</ENAMEX> had asked about getting military help, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Command Center</ENAMEX> suggested that someone at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX> should decide whether to request military assistance: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA Headquarters</ENAMEX>: They're pulling <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeff</ENAMEX> away to go talk about <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">United</ENAMEX> 93.

    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Command Center</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Uh</ENAMEX>, do we want to think, uh, about scrambling <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>?

    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA Headquarters</ENAMEX>: Oh, God, I don't know.

    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Command Center</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Uh</ENAMEX>, that's a decision somebody's gonna have to make probably in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the next ten minutes</TIMEX>.

    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA Headquarters</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Uh</ENAMEX>, ya know everybody just left the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>.

    At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:53</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX> informed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Command Center</ENAMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">deputy director</ENAMEX> for air traffic services was talking to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Monte Belger</ENAMEX> about scrambling <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>. Then the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Command Center</ENAMEX> informed <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">controllers</ENAMEX> had lost track of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">United 93</ENAMEX> over the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX> area. Within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">seconds</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Command Center</ENAMEX> received a visual report from another <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>, and informed <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 miles</NUMEX> northwest of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Johnstown</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United 93</ENAMEX> was spotted by another <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>, and, at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10:01</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Command Center</ENAMEX> advised <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX> that one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> had seen <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United 93</ENAMEX> "waving his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wings</ENAMEX>." The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> had witnessed the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hijackers</ENAMEX>' efforts to defeat the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX>' counterattack.

    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United 93</ENAMEX> crashed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10:03:11</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">125 miles</NUMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">D.C.</ENAMEX> The precise crash time has been the subject of some dispute. The <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10:03:11 impact time</TIMEX> is supported by previous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Transportation Safety Board</ENAMEX> analysis and by evidence from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> 's analysis of radar, the flight data recorder, the cockpit voice recorder, infrared satellite data, and air traffic control transmissions.

    <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Five minutes</TIMEX> later, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Command Center</ENAMEX> forwarded this update to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Command Center</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O.K. Uh</ENAMEX>, there is now on that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX> 93.

    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA Headquarters</ENAMEX>: Yes.

    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Command Center</ENAMEX>: There is a report of black smoke in the last position I gave you, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">fifteen miles</NUMEX> south of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Johnstown</ENAMEX>.

    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA Headquarters</ENAMEX>: From the airplane or from the ground?

    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Command Center</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Uh</ENAMEX>, they're speculating it's from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA Headquarters</ENAMEX>: Okay.

    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Command Center</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Uh</ENAMEX>, who, it hit the ground. That's what they're speculating, that's speculation only.

    The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> that spotted the "black smoke" was the same unarmed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air National Guard</ENAMEX> cargo <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> that had seen <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">77</TIMEX> crash into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">27 minutes earlier</TIMEX>. It had resumed its flight to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minnesota</ENAMEX> and saw the smoke from <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the crash of United 93</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">less than two minutes</TIMEX> after the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> went down. At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10:17</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Command Center</ENAMEX> advised <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX> of its conclusion that <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">United 93</ENAMEX> had indeed crashed.

    Despite the discussions about military assistance, no one from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX> requested military assistance regarding <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">United 93</ENAMEX>. Nor did any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX> pass any of the information it had about <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">United 93</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">military</ENAMEX>.

Military Notification and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Response</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEADS</ENAMEX> first received a call about <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">United 93</ENAMEX> from the military liaison at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cleveland Center</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10:07</TIMEX>. Unaware that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> had already crashed, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cleveland</ENAMEX> passed to NEADS the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>'s last known latitude and longitude. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEADS</ENAMEX> was never able to locate <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">United 93</ENAMEX> on radar because it was already in the ground.

    At the same time, the NEADS mission crew <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commander</ENAMEX> was dealing with the arrival of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Langley</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">fighters</ENAMEX> over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">D.C.</ENAMEX>, sorting out what their orders were with respect to potential <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX>. Shortly after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10:10</TIMEX>, and having no knowledge either that <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">United 93</ENAMEX> had been heading toward <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> or that it had crashed, he explicitly instructed the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Langley</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">fighters</ENAMEX>: "negative- negative clearance to shoot" <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> over the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s capital.

    The news of a reported <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bomb</ENAMEX> on board <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">United 93</ENAMEX> spread quickly at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEADS</ENAMEX>. The air <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defenders</ENAMEX> searched for <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">United 93</ENAMEX>'s primary radar return and tried to locate other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fighters</ENAMEX> to scramble. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEADS</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Washington Center</ENAMEX> to report: NEADS: I also want to give you a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heads</ENAMEX>-up, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>.

    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DC</ENAMEX>): Go ahead.

    NEADS: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine three</NUMEX>, have you got information on that yet? <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>: Yeah, he's down.

    NEADS: He's down?

    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>: Yes.

    NEADS: When did he land? 'Cause we have got confirmation- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>: He did not land.

    NEADS: Oh, he's down? Down?

    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>: Yes. Somewhere up northeast of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Camp David</ENAMEX>.

    NEADS: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northeast</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Camp David</ENAMEX>.

    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>: That's the last report. They don't know exactly where.

    The time of notification of the crash of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">United 93</ENAMEX> was <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10:15</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEADS</ENAMEX> air <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defenders</ENAMEX> never located the flight or followed it on their radar <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">scopes</ENAMEX>. The flight had already crashed by the time they learned it was hijacked.

Clarifying the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Record</ENAMEX>

    The defense of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> airspace on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9/11</TIMEX> was not conducted in accord with preexisting training and protocols. It was improvised by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> who had never handled a hijacked <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> that attempted to disappear, and by a military unprepared for the transformation of commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> into <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX> of mass destruction. As it turned out, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEADS</ENAMEX> air <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defenders</ENAMEX> had <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">nine minutes</TIMEX>' notice on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> hijacked <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX>, no advance notice on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>, no advance notice on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX>, and no advance notice on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX>.

    We do not believe that the true picture of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">that morning</TIMEX> reflects discredit on the operational <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEADS</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEADS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commanders</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> actively sought out information, and made the best judgments they could on the basis of what they knew. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Individual FAA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">controllers</ENAMEX>, facility <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Command Center</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> thought outside the box in recommending a nationwide alert, in ground-stopping local traffic, and, ultimately, in deciding to land all <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> and executing that unprecedented order flawlessly.

    More than the actual events, inaccurate government accounts of those events made it appear that the military was notified in time to respond to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of the hijackings, raising questions about the adequacy of the response. Those accounts had the effect of deflecting questions about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">military</ENAMEX>'s capacity to obtain timely and accurate information from its own <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>. In addition, they overstated the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>'s ability to provide the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">military</ENAMEX> with timely and useful information that <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX>.

    In public testimony before this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 2003</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NORAD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> stated that at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:16</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEADS</ENAMEX> received hijack notification of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">United 93</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>. This statement was incorrect. There was no hijack to report at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:16</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United 93</ENAMEX> was proceeding normally at that time.

    In this same public testimony, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NORAD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> stated that at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:24</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEADS</ENAMEX> received notification of the hijacking of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">77</TIMEX>. This statement was also incorrect. The notice <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEADS</ENAMEX> received at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:24</TIMEX> was that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American 11</ENAMEX> had not hit the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Trade Center</ENAMEX> and was heading for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">D.C.</ENAMEX>

    In their testimony and in other public accounts, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NORAD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> also stated that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Langley</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">fighters</ENAMEX> were scrambled to respond to the notifications about <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">77,178 United 93</ENAMEX>, or both. These statements were incorrect as well. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fighters</ENAMEX> were scrambled because of the report that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> was heading south, as is clear not just from taped conversations at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEADS</ENAMEX> but also from taped conversations at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contemporaneous</ENAMEX> logs compiled at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEADS</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Continental Region</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NORAD</ENAMEX>; and other records. Yet this response to a phantom <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> was not recounted in a single public timeline or statement issued by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Defense</ENAMEX>. The inaccurate accounts created the impression that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Langley</ENAMEX> scramble was a logical response to an actual hijacked <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>.

    In fact, not only was the scramble prompted by the mistaken information about <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>, but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEADS</ENAMEX> never received notice that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">77</TIMEX> was hijacked. It was notified at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:34</TIMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">77</TIMEX> was lost. Then, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> later, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEADS</ENAMEX> was told that an unknown <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6 miles</NUMEX> southwest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>. Only then did the already scrambled <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">airplanes</ENAMEX> start moving directly toward <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">D.C.</ENAMEX>

    Thus the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">military</ENAMEX> did not have <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">14 minutes</TIMEX> to respond to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">77</TIMEX>, as testimony to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 2003</TIMEX> suggested. It had at most one or <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two minutes</TIMEX> to react to the unidentified <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> approaching <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fighters</ENAMEX> were in the wrong place to be able to help. They had been responding to a report about an aircraft that did not exist.

    Nor did the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">military</ENAMEX> have <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">47 minutes</TIMEX> to respond to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United 93</ENAMEX>, as would be implied by the account that it received notice of the flight's hijacking at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:16</TIMEX>. By the time the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">military</ENAMEX> learned about the flight, it had crashed. We now turn to the role of national <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> in the events that <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX>.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATIONAL CRISIS MANAGEMENT</ENAMEX>
	
    When <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> struck the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Trade Center</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:46</TIMEX>, no one in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> or traveling with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> knew that it had been hijacked. While that information circulated within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>, we found no evidence that the hijacking was reported to any other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> before <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:46</TIMEX>.

    Most federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> learned about the crash in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNN</ENAMEX>.

    Within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">administrator</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jane Garvey</ENAMEX>, and her acting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">deputy</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Monte Belger</ENAMEX>, had not been told of a confirmed hijacking before they learned from television that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> had crashed.

    Others in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> were aware of it, as we explained earlier in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX>.

    Inside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Military Command Center</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">deputy director</ENAMEX> of operations and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assistant</ENAMEX> began notifying senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> of the incident. At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 9:00</TIMEX>, the senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NMCC</ENAMEX> operations <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> reached out to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> operations <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> for information. Although the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NMCC</ENAMEX> was advised of the hijacking of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>, the scrambling of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">jets</ENAMEX> was not discussed.

    In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sarasota</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX>, the presidential motorcade was arriving at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Emma E. Booker</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Elementary School</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> was to read to a class and talk about education. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chief of Staff</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrew Card</ENAMEX> told us he was standing with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">classroom</ENAMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senior Advisor</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karl Rove</ENAMEX> first informed them that a small, twin-engine <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> had crashed into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Trade Center</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX>'s reaction was that the incident must have been caused by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot</ENAMEX> error.

    At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:55</TIMEX>, before entering the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">classroom</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> spoke to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice</ENAMEX>, who was at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>. She recalled first telling the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> it was a twin-engine <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>-and then a commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>-that had struck the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Trade Center</ENAMEX>, adding "that's all we know right now, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX>."

    At the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dick Cheney</ENAMEX> had just sat down for a meeting when his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assistant</ENAMEX> told him to turn on his television because a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> had struck the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NorthTower</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Trade Center</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> was wondering "how the hell could a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> hit the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Trade Center</ENAMEX>" when he saw the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> strike the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">South Tower</ENAMEX>.

    Elsewhere in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>, a series of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:00</TIMEX> meetings was about to begin. In the absence of information that the crash was anything other than an accident, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> monitored the news as they went ahead with their regular schedules.

    When they learned a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> had struck the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Trade Center</ENAMEX>, nearly everyone in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> told us, they immediately knew it was not an accident. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Secret Service</ENAMEX> initiated a number of security enhancements around the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> complex. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> who issued these orders did not know that there were additional hijacked <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>, or that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> such <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> was en route to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>. These measures were precautionary steps taken because of the strikes in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>.

    The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House Teleconferences</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense Department</ENAMEX> each initiated a multiagency teleconference before <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:30</TIMEX>. Because none of these teleconferences-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least</NUMEX> before <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10:00-</TIMEX> included the right <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> from both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense Department</ENAMEX>, none succeeded in meaningfully coordinating the military and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> response to the hijackings.

    At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 9:20</TIMEX>, security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX> set up a hijacking teleconference with several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>, including the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense Department</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NMCC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> who participated told us that the call was monitored only periodically because the information was sporadic, it was of little value, and there were other important tasks. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> of the teleconference also remembered that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">military</ENAMEX> participated only briefly before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> was hit. Both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> agreed that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">teleconference</ENAMEX> played no role in coordinating a response to the attacks of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX>. Acting Deputy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Administrator</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Belger</ENAMEX> was frustrated to learn later in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">military</ENAMEX> had not been on the call.

    At the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>, the video teleconference was conducted from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Situation Room</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Clarke</ENAMEX>, a special <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assistant</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> long involved in counterterrorism. Logs indicate that it began at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:25</TIMEX> and included the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">departments</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense</ENAMEX>; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>; and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> shelter. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> joined at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:40</TIMEX>. The first topic addressed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> video teleconference-at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 9:40-</TIMEX>was the physical security of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>, and federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>. Immediately thereafter it was reported that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> had hit the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX>. We found no evidence that video teleconference <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> had any prior information that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American 77</ENAMEX> had been hijacked and was heading directly toward <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>. Indeed, it is not clear to us that the video teleconference was fully under way before <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:37</TIMEX>, when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> was struck.

    <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Garvey</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Belger</ENAMEX>, and other senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX> participated in this video teleconference at various times. We do not know who from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense</ENAMEX> participated, but we know that in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the first hour</TIMEX> none of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> involved in managing the crisis did. And none of the information conveyed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> video teleconference, at least in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the first hour</TIMEX>, was being passed to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NMCC</ENAMEX>. As <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witness</ENAMEX> recalled, "[It] was almost like there were parallel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">decisionmaking</ENAMEX> processes going on; one was a voice conference orchestrated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NMCC</ENAMEX> . . . and then there was the [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> video <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">teleconference</ENAMEX>]. . . . [I]n my mind they were competing venues for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">command</ENAMEX> and control and decisionmaking."

    At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10:03</TIMEX>, the conference received reports of more missing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>, "<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2 possibly 3</NUMEX> aloft," and learned of a combat air <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">patrol</ENAMEX> over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>. There was discussion of the need for rules of engagement. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> reported that they were asking the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> for authority to shoot down <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>. Confirmation of that authority came at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10:25</TIMEX>, but the commands were already being conveyed in more direct contacts with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX>.

The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon Teleconferences</ENAMEX>. Inside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Military Command Center</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">deputy director</ENAMEX> for operations immediately thought the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> strike was a terrorist attack. The job of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NMCC</ENAMEX> in such an emergency is to gather the relevant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parties</ENAMEX> and establish the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> of command between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Command Authority</ENAMEX>-the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> and the secretary of defense- and those who need to carry out their orders.

    On <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 11</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> was having breakfast at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> with a group of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>. He then returned to his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> for his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> intelligence briefing. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> was informed of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> strike in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> during the briefing; he resumed the briefing while awaiting more information. After the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> was struck, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> went to the parking lot to assist with rescue efforts.

    Inside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NMCC</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">deputy director</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> called for an allpurpose "significant event" conference. It began at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:29</TIMEX>, with a brief recap: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> had struck the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Trade Center</ENAMEX>, there was a confirmed hijacking of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Otis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">fighters</ENAMEX> had been scrambled. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> was asked to provide an update, but the line was silent because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> had not been added to the call. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">A minute</TIMEX> later, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">deputy director</ENAMEX> stated that it had just been confirmed that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> was still airborne and heading toward <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">D.C.</ENAMEX> He directed the transition to an air threat conference call. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NORAD</ENAMEX> confirmed that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> was airborne and heading toward <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>, relaying the erroneous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> information already mentioned. The call then ended, at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 9:34</TIMEX>.

    It resumed at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:37</TIMEX> as an air threat conference call,* which lasted <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">more than eight hours</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice Chairman</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joint Chiefs of Staff</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Deputy National Security Advisor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Hadley</ENAMEX> all participated in this teleconference at various times, as did military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> underground shelter and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX>'s military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aide</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force One</ENAMEX>.

    <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Operators</ENAMEX> worked feverishly to include the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>, but they had equipment problems and difficulty finding secure phone numbers. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NORAD</ENAMEX> asked <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times before <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10:03</TIMEX> to confirm the presence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> in the teleconference. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> who finally joined the call at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10:17</TIMEX> had no familiarity with or responsibility for hijackings, no access to decisionmakers, and none of the information available to senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>.

    * All times given for this conference call are estimates, which we and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Defense</ENAMEX> believe to be accurate within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a � 3 minute</TIMEX> margin of error.

    We found no evidence that, at this critical time, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NORAD</ENAMEX>'s top <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commanders</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cheyenne Mountain</ENAMEX>, coordinated with their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterparts</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX> to improve awareness and organize a common response. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lower-level</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> improvised-for example, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boston Center</ENAMEX> bypassed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">command</ENAMEX> and directly contacted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEADS</ENAMEX> after the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> hijacking. But the highest-level <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense Department</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> relied on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NMCC</ENAMEX>'s air threat conference, in which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> did not participate for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the first 48 minutes</TIMEX>.

    At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:39</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NMCC</ENAMEX>'s deputy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX>, a military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX>, opened the call from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX>, which had just been hit. He began:"An air attack against <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North America</ENAMEX> may be in progress. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NORAD</ENAMEX>, what's the situation?" <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NORAD</ENAMEX> said it had conflicting reports. Its latest information was "of a possible hijacked aircraft taking off out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JFK</ENAMEX> en route to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">D.C.</ENAMEX>" The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NMCC</ENAMEX> reported a crash into the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mall</ENAMEX> side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> and requested that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> of Defense be added to the conference.

    At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:44</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NORAD</ENAMEX> briefed the conference on the possible hijacking of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1989</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Two minutes</TIMEX> later, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> reported that they were still trying to locate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Myers</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice Chairman</ENAMEX> joined the conference shortly before <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10:00</TIMEX>; the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX>, shortly before <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10:30</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chairman</ENAMEX> was out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>.

    At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:48</TIMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> shelter asked if there were any indications of another hijacked <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">deputy director</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> mentioned the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta</ENAMEX> flight and concluded that "that would be the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> possible hijack." At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:49</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commander</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NORAD</ENAMEX> directed all air sovereignty <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> to battle <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stations</ENAMEX>, fully armed.

    At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:59</TIMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX> lieutenant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colonel</ENAMEX> working in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House Military Office</ENAMEX> joined the conference and stated he had just talked to Deputy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">National Security Advisor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Hadley</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> requested (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) the implementation of continuity of government measures, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fighter</ENAMEX> escorts for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force One</ENAMEX>, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) a fighter combat air <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">patrol</ENAMEX> over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">D.C.</ENAMEX>

    By <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10:03</TIMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">United 93</ENAMEX> crashed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX>, there had been no mention of its hijacking and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> had not yet been added to the teleconference.

    The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> was seated in a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">classroom</ENAMEX> when, at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:05</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Andrew Card</ENAMEX> whispered to him: "A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> hit the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> is under attack." The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> told us his instinct was to project calm, not to have the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> see an excited reaction at a moment of crisis. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">press</ENAMEX> was standing behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>; he saw their phones and pagers start to ring. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> felt he should project strength and calm until he could better understand what was happening.

    The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> remained in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">classroom</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">another five to seven</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX>,

    while the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> continued reading. He then returned to a holding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">room</ENAMEX> shortly before <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:15</TIMEX>, where he was briefed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> and saw television coverage. He next spoke to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheney</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rice</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Governor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Pataki</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Mueller</ENAMEX>. He decided to make a brief statement from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> before leaving for the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Secret Service</ENAMEX> told us they were anxious to move the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> to a safer location, but did not think it imperative for him to run out the door.

    Between <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:15 and 9:30</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> was busy arranging a return to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>, while the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> consulted his senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisers</ENAMEX> about his remarks. No one in the traveling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> had any information during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this time</TIMEX> that other <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> were hijacked or missing. Staff was in contact with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House Situation Room</ENAMEX>, but as far as we could determine, no one with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> was in contact with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX>. The focus was on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX>'s statement to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>. The only decision made during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this time</TIMEX> was to return to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>.

    The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX>'s motorcade departed at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:35</TIMEX>, and arrived at the airport <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">between 9:42 and 9:45</TIMEX>. During the ride the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> learned about the attack on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX>. He boarded the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>, asked the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Secret Service</ENAMEX> about the safety of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, and called the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX>. According to notes of the call, at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 9:45</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> told the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX>:"Sounds like we have a minor war going on here, I heard about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX>. We're at war . . . somebody's going to pay."

    <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">About this time</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Card</ENAMEX>, the lead <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Secret Service</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX>'s military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aide</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot</ENAMEX> were conferring on a possible destination for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force One</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Secret Service</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> felt strongly that the situation in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> was too unstable for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> to return there, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Card</ENAMEX> agreed. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> strongly wanted to return to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> and only grudgingly agreed to go elsewhere. The issue was still undecided when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> conferred with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> at about the time <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force One</ENAMEX> was taking off. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> recalled urging the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> not to return to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force One</ENAMEX> departed at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 9:54</TIMEX> without any fixed destination. The objective was to get up in the air-as fast and as high as possible-and then decide where to go.

    At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:33</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supervisor</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Reagan National Airport</ENAMEX> picked up a hotline to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Secret Service</ENAMEX> and told the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Service</ENAMEX>'s operations <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> that "an aircraft [is] coming at you and not talking with us." This was the first specific report to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Secret Service</ENAMEX> of a direct threat to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>. No move was made to evacuate the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> at this time. As the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> who took the call explained, "[I was] about to push the alert button when the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> advised that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> was turning south and approaching <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Reagan National Airport</ENAMEX>."

    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American 77</ENAMEX> began turning south, away from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>, at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:34</TIMEX>. It continued heading south for roughly a minute, before turning west and beginning to circle back. This news prompted the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Secret Service</ENAMEX> to order the immediate evacuation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> just before <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:36</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Agents</ENAMEX> propelled him out of his chair and told him he had to get to the bunker. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> entered the underground <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tunnel</ENAMEX> leading to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shelter</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:37</TIMEX>.

    Once inside, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheney</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> paused in an area of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tunnel</ENAMEX> that had a secure phone, a bench, and television. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> asked to speak to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX>, but it took time for the call to be connected. He learned in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tunnel</ENAMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> had been hit, and he saw television coverage of smoke coming from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>.

    The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Secret Service</ENAMEX> logged Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheney</ENAMEX>'s arrival at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:52</TIMEX>, and she joined her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">husband</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tunnel</ENAMEX>. According to contemporaneous notes, at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:55</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> was still on the phone with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> advising that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX> were missing and one had hit the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX>. We believe this is the same call in which the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> urged the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> not to return to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>. After the call ended, Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheney</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> moved from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tunnel</ENAMEX> to the shelter conference <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>.

    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United 93</ENAMEX> and the Shootdown Order On <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> stayed in contact not by an open line of communication but through a series of calls. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> told us he was frustrated with the poor communications that <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX>. He could not reach key <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX>, for a period of time. The line to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> shelter conference <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>-and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX>- kept cutting off.

    The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> remembered placing a call to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> just after entering the shelter conference <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>. There is conflicting evidence about when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> arrived in the shelter conference <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>. We have concluded, from the available evidence, that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> arrived in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> shortly before <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10:00</TIMEX>, perhaps at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:58</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> recalled being told, just after his arrival, that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX> was trying to establish a combat air <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">patrol</ENAMEX> over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>.

    The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> stated that he called the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> to discuss the rules of engagement for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">CAP</ENAMEX>. He recalled feeling that it did no good to establish the CAP unless the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> had instructions on whether they were authorized to shoot if the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> would not divert. He said the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> signed off on that concept. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> said he remembered such a conversation, and that it reminded him of when he had been an interceptor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> emphasized to us that he had authorized the shootdown of hijacked <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>.

    The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX>'s military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aide</ENAMEX> told us he believed the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> spoke to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> just after entering the conference <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>, but he did not hear what they said. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rice</ENAMEX>, who entered the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> shortly after the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> and sat next to him, remembered hearing him inform the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX>, "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sir</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAPs</ENAMEX> are up. Sir, they're going to want to know what to do." Then she recalled hearing him say, "Yes sir." She believed this conversation occurred <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a few minutes</TIMEX>, perhaps <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>, after they entered the conference <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>.

    We believe this call would have taken place sometime before <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10:10 to 10:15</TIMEX>.

    Among the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> that reflect other important events of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">that morning</TIMEX>, there is no documentary evidence for this call, but the relevant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> are incomplete. Others nearby who were taking notes, such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief of staff</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scooter Libby</ENAMEX>, who sat next to him, and Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheney</ENAMEX>, did not note a call between the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> immediately after the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> entered the conference <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>.

    At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10:02</TIMEX>, the communicators in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shelter</ENAMEX> began receiving reports from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Secret Service</ENAMEX> of an inbound <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>-presumably hijacked-heading toward <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>. That <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> was <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">United 93</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Secret Service</ENAMEX> was getting this information directly from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> may have been tracking the progress of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">93</NUMEX> on a display that showed its projected path to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>, not its actual radar return. Thus, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Secret Service</ENAMEX> was relying on projections and was not aware the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> was already down in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX>.

    At some time <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">between 10:10 and 10:15</TIMEX>, a military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aide</ENAMEX> told the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> and others that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">80 miles</NUMEX> out. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheney</ENAMEX> was asked for authority to engage the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>.

    His reaction was described by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scooter Libby</ENAMEX> as quick and decisive, "in about the time it takes a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">batter</ENAMEX> to decide to swing." The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> authorized fighter <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> to engage the inbound <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX>. He told us he based this authorization on his earlier conversation with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX>. The military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aide</ENAMEX> returned <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a few minutes</TIMEX> later, probably <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">between 10:12 and 10:18</TIMEX>, and said the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">60 miles</NUMEX> out. He again asked for authorization to engage. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> again said yes.

    At the conference <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> table was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> Deputy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chief of Staff</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joshua Bolten</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bolten</ENAMEX> watched the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchanges</ENAMEX> and, after what he called "a quiet moment,"suggested that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> get in touch with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> and confirm the engage order. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bolten</ENAMEX> told us he wanted to make sure the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> was told that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> had executed the order. He said he had not heard any prior discussion on the subject with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX>.

    The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> was logged calling the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10:18</TIMEX> for a twominute conversation that obtained the confirmation. On <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force One</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">press secretary</ENAMEX> was taking notes; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ari Fleischer</ENAMEX> recorded that at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10:20</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> told him that he had authorized a shootdown of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> if necessary.

    <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Minutes</TIMEX> went by and word arrived of an aircraft down in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX>. Those in the shelter wondered if the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> had been shot down pursuant to this authorization.

    At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">approximately 10:30</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shelter</ENAMEX> started receiving reports of another hijacked <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX>, this time <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only 5 to 10 miles</NUMEX> out. Believing they had only a minute or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> again communicated the authorization to "engage or "take out" the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>. At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10:33</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hadley</ENAMEX> told the air threat conference call: "I need to get word to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dick Myers</ENAMEX> that our reports are there's an inbound <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> flying low <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 miles</NUMEX> out. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX>'s guidance was we need to take them out."

    Once again, there was no immediate information about the fate of the inbound <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>. In the apt description of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witness</ENAMEX>, "It drops below the radar screen and it's just continually hovering in your imagination; you don't know where it is or what happens to it." Eventually, the shelter received word that the alleged hijacker <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 miles</NUMEX> away had been a medevac <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">helicopter</ENAMEX>.

    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transmission of the Authorization</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pilots The NMCC</ENAMEX> learned of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United 93</ENAMEX>'s hijacking at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 10:03</TIMEX>. At this time the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> had no contact with the military at the level of national <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">command</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NMCC</ENAMEX> learned about <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">United 93</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>. It, in turn, was informed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Secret Service</ENAMEX>'s contacts with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>.

    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NORAD</ENAMEX> had no information either. At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10:07</TIMEX>, its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> on the air threat conference call stated that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NORAD</ENAMEX> had "no indication of a hijack heading to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DC</ENAMEX> at this time."

    <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Repeatedly</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">between 10:14 and 10:19</TIMEX>, a lieutenant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colonel</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> relayed to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NMCC</ENAMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> had confirmed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fighters</ENAMEX> were cleared to engage inbound <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> if they could verify that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> was hijacked.

    The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commander</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NORAD</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">General</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ralph Eberhart</ENAMEX>, was en route to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NORAD</ENAMEX> operations <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cheyenne Mountain</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colorado</ENAMEX>, when the shootdown order was communicated on the air threat conference call. He told us that by the time he arrived, the order had already been passed down <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NORAD</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">command</ENAMEX>.

    It is not clear how the shootdown order was communicated within <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NORAD</ENAMEX>. But we know that at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10:31</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">General</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry Arnold</ENAMEX> instructed his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> to broadcast the following over a NORAD instant messaging system: "<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10:31</TIMEX> Vice <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> has cleared to us to intercept tracks of interest and shoot them down if they do not respond per [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Arnold</ENAMEX>]."

    In upstate <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEADS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> first learned of the shootdown order from this message: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Floor Leadership</ENAMEX>: You need to read this. . . . The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Region</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Commander</ENAMEX> has declared that we can shoot down <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> that do not respond to our direction. Copy that?

    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Controllers</ENAMEX>: Copy that, sir.

    Floor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Leadership</ENAMEX>: So if you're trying to divert somebody and he won't divert- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Controllers</ENAMEX>: DO [<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Operations</ENAMEX>] is saying no.

    Floor <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Leadership: No</ENAMEX>? It came over the chat. . . . You got a conflict on that direction?

    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Controllers</ENAMEX>: Right now no, but- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Floor Leadership</ENAMEX>: Okay? <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Okay</ENAMEX>, you read that from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX>, right? <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> has cleared. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> has cleared us to intercept traffic and shoot them down if they do not respond per [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Arnold</ENAMEX>]. In interviews with us, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEADS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> expressed considerable confusion over the nature and effect of the order.

    The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEADS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commander</ENAMEX> told us he did not pass along the order because he was unaware of its ramifications. Both the mission <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commander</ENAMEX> and the senior weapons <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> indicated they did not pass the order to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fighters</ENAMEX> circling <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> because they were unsure how the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> would, or should, proceed with this guidance. In short, while <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> believed that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">fighters</ENAMEX> above them had been instructed to "take out" hostile <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>, the only orders actually conveyed to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> were to "<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ID type</ENAMEX> and tail."

    In most cases, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">command</ENAMEX> authorizing the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> runs from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> to the secretary of defense and from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX> to the combatant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commander</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> apparently spoke to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">that morning</TIMEX> shortly after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10:00</TIMEX>. No one can recall the content of this conversation, but it was a brief call in which the subject of shootdown authority was not discussed.

    At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10:39</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> updated the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> on the air threat conference: <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX>: There's been <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least three</NUMEX> instances here where we've had reports of aircraft approaching <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>-a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> were confirmed hijack. And, pursuant to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX>'s instructions I gave authorization for them to be taken out. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Hello</ENAMEX>?

    SecDef: Yes, I understand. Who did you give that direction to?

    <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX>: It was passed from here through the [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX>] <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>, from the [shelter].

    SecDef: OK, let me ask the question here. Has that directive been transmitted to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>?

    <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX>: Yes, it has.

    SecDef: So we've got a couple of aircraft up there that have those instructions at this present time?

    <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX>: That is correct. And it's my understanding they've already taken a couple of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> out.

    SecDef: We can't confirm that. We're told that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> is down but we do not have a pilot report that did it.

    As this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> shows, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> was not in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NMCC</ENAMEX> when the shootdown order was first conveyed. He went from the parking lot to his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> (where he spoke to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX>), then to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Executive Support Center</ENAMEX>, where he participated in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> video teleconference. He moved to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NMCC</ENAMEX> shortly before <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10:30</TIMEX>, in order to join <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Myers</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> told us he was just gaining situational awareness when he spoke with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10:39</TIMEX>. His primary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> was ensuring that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> had a clear understanding of their rules of engagement.

    The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> was mistaken in his belief that shootdown authorization had been passed to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> flying at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NORAD</ENAMEX>'s direction. By <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10:45</TIMEX> there was, however, another set of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fighters</ENAMEX> circling <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> that had entirely different rules of engagement. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fighters</ENAMEX>, part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">113th Wing</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">District of Columbia</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air National Guard</ENAMEX>, launched out of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Andrews Air Force Base</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maryland</ENAMEX> in response to information passed to them by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Secret Service</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Andrews</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fighters</ENAMEX> was airborne at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10:38</TIMEX>.

    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Wherley</ENAMEX>-the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commander</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">113th Wing</ENAMEX>-reached out to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Secret Service</ENAMEX> after hearing secondhand reports that it wanted <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fighters</ENAMEX> airborne. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Secret Service</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> had a phone in each ear, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> connected to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wherley</ENAMEX> and the other to a fellow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>, relaying instructions that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> said he was getting from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX>. The guidance for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wherley</ENAMEX> was to send up the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>, with orders to protect the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> and take out any <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> that threatened the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Capitol</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Wherley</ENAMEX> translated this in military terms to flying "weapons free"-that is, the decision to shoot rests in the cockpit, or in this case in the cockpit of the lead <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot</ENAMEX>. He passed these instructions to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> that launched at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10:42</TIMEX> and afterward.

    Thus, while the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fighter pilots</ENAMEX> under <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">NORAD</ENAMEX> direction who had scrambled out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Langley</ENAMEX> never received any type of engagement order, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Andrews</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> were operating <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX> free-a permissive rule of engagement. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> indicated to us they had not been aware that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fighters</ENAMEX> had been scrambled out of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrews</ENAMEX>, at the request of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Secret Service</ENAMEX> and outside the military <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">command</ENAMEX>.

    There is no evidence that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NORAD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX> or military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NMCC</ENAMEX> knew-during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 11</TIMEX>-that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Andrews</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX> were airborne and operating under different rules of engagement.

What If?

    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NORAD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> have maintained consistently that had the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> not caused <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">93</NUMEX> to crash, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">military</ENAMEX> would have prevented it from reaching <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">D.C.</ENAMEX> That conclusion is based on a version of events that we now know is incorrect. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Langley</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">fighters</ENAMEX> were not scrambled in response to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">93</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NORAD</ENAMEX> did not have <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">47 minutes</TIMEX> to intercept the flight; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NORAD</ENAMEX> did not even know the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> was hijacked until after it had crashed. It is appropriate, therefore, to reconsider whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United 93</ENAMEX> would have been intercepted.

    Had it not crashed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10:03</TIMEX>, we estimate that <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">United 93</ENAMEX> could not have reached <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">any earlier</TIMEX> than <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10:13</TIMEX>, and probably would have arrived before <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10:23</TIMEX>. There was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> set of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fighters</ENAMEX> circling <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> during that time frame-the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Langley F-16s</ENAMEX>. They were armed and under <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NORAD</ENAMEX>'s control. After <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEADS</ENAMEX> learned of the hijacking at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10:07</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NORAD</ENAMEX> would have had <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">from 6 to 16 minutes</TIMEX> to locate the flight, receive authorization to shoot it down, and communicate the order to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX>, who (in the same <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">span</ENAMEX>) would have had to authenticate the order, intercept the flight, and execute the order.

    At that point in time, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Langley</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> did not know the threat they were facing, did not know where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United 93</ENAMEX> was located, and did not have shootdown authorization.

    First, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Langley</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> were never briefed about the reason they were scrambled. As the lead <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot</ENAMEX> explained, "I reverted to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> threat. . . . I'm thinking cruise <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missile</ENAMEX> threat from the sea. You know you look down and see the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> burning and I thought the bastards snuck <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> by us. . . . [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX>]<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ou</ENAMEX> couldn't see any <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">airplanes</ENAMEX>, and no one told us anything." The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> knew their mission was to divert <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>, but did not know that the threat came from hijacked <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">airliners</ENAMEX>.

    <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEADS</ENAMEX> did not have accurate information on the location of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">United 93</ENAMEX>. Presumably <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> would have provided such information, but we do not know how long that would have taken, nor how long it would have taken <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEADS</ENAMEX> to locate the target.

    <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEADS</ENAMEX> needed orders to pass to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX>. At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10:10</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> were emphatically told, "negative clearance to shoot." <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shootdown</ENAMEX> authority was first communicated to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEADS</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10:31</TIMEX>. It is possible that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NORAD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commanders</ENAMEX> would have ordered a shootdown in the absence of the authorization communicated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX>, but given the gravity of the decision to shoot down a commercial airliner, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NORAD</ENAMEX>'s caution that a mistake not be made, we view this possibility as unlikely.

    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NORAD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> have maintained that they would have intercepted and shot down <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">United 93</ENAMEX>. We are not so sure. We are sure that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> owes a debt to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">United 93</ENAMEX>. Their actions saved the lives of countless others, and may have saved either the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Capitol</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> from destruction.

    The details of what happened on <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 11</TIMEX> are complex, but they play out a simple theme. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NORAD</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> were unprepared for the type of attacks launched against the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 11, 2001</TIMEX>. They struggled, under difficult circumstances, to improvise a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">homeland</ENAMEX> defense against an unprecedented challenge they had never before encountered and had never trained to meet.

    At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10:02 that morning</TIMEX>, an assistant to the mission crew <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commander</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NORAD</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northeast Air Defense Sector</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>, was working with his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> on the floor of the command <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>. In a brief moment of reflection, he was recorded remarking that "This is a new type of war."

    He was, and is, right. But the conflict did not begin on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX>. It had been publicly declared <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years earlier</TIMEX>, most notably in a declaration faxed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early in 1998</TIMEX> to an <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Arabic</ENAMEX>-language <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspaper</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX>. Few <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> had noticed it. The fax had been sent from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">thousands of miles</NUMEX> away by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">followers</ENAMEX> of a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Saudi</ENAMEX> exile gathered in one of the most remote and impoverished <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> on earth.
