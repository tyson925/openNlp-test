            In chapters <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 and 4</TIMEX> we described how the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> adjusted its existing
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agencies</ENAMEX> and capacities to address the emerging threat from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Usama Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> and his
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">associates</ENAMEX>. After the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 1998</TIMEX> bombings of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">embassies</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kenya</ENAMEX> and
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tanzania</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Clinton</ENAMEX> and his chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aides</ENAMEX> explored ways of getting Bin
                Ladin expelled from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> or possibly capturing or even killing him. Although
                disruption efforts around the world had achieved some successes, the core of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bin</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ladin</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> remained intact. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> was deeply concerned about
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>. He and his national security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samuel "Sandy" Berger</ENAMEX>, ensured they
                had a special <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> pipeline of reports feeding them the latest updates on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bin</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ladin's</ENAMEX> reported location.
            
            In <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> spoke repeatedly about the threat of terrorism,
                referring to terrorist training <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camps</ENAMEX> but saying little about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> and nothing
                about <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>. He explained to us that this was deliberate-intended to avoid
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">enhancing Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>'s stature by giving him unnecessary publicity. His speeches
                focused especially on the danger of nonstate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actors</ENAMEX> and of chemical and biological
                    weapons.
            
            As <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the millennium</TIMEX> approached, the most publicized worries were not about terrorism
                but about computer breakdowns-the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Y2K</ENAMEX> scare. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> were
                concerned that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX> would take advantage of such breakdowns.
            
            THE <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MILLENNIUM CRISIS</ENAMEX>
            "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bodies Will Pile Up in Sacks</ENAMEX>"
            On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November 30, 1999</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jordanian</ENAMEX> intelligence intercepted a telephone call between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abu</ENAMEX>
                Zubaydah, a longtime <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ally</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Khadr Abu Hoshar</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palestinian</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">extremist</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abu Zubaydah</ENAMEX> said, "The time for training is over." Suspecting that this
                was a signal for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abu Hoshar</ENAMEX> to commence a terrorist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jordanian</ENAMEX> police
                arrested <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abu Hoshar</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> others and informed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>.
            
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Raed Hijazi</ENAMEX>, had been born in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Palestinian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>; after
                spending his childhood in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Middle East</ENAMEX>, he had returned to northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>,
                taken refuge in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">extremist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Islamist</ENAMEX> beliefs, and then made his way to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abu Zubaydah</ENAMEX>'s
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Khaldan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camp</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>, where he learned the fundamentals of guerrilla warfare.
                He and his younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> had been recruited by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abu Hoshar</ENAMEX> into a loosely knit plot
                to attack <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jordan</ENAMEX>.
            
            After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late 1996</TIMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abu Hoshar</ENAMEX> was arrested and jailed, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hijazi</ENAMEX> moved back to the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX>, worked as a cabdriver in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX>, and sent money back to his fellow
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">plotters</ENAMEX>. After <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abu Hoshar</ENAMEX>'s release, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hijazi</ENAMEX> shuttled between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jordan</ENAMEX>
                gathering money and supplies. With <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abu Hoshar</ENAMEX>, he recruited inTurkey and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Syria</ENAMEX> as
                well as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jordan</ENAMEX>; with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abu Zubaydah's</ENAMEX> assistance, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abu Hoshar</ENAMEX> sent these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recruits</ENAMEX> to
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> for training.
            
            In late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hijazi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abu Hoshar</ENAMEX> had settled on a plan. They would <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> attack
                <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">targets</ENAMEX>: the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS Radisson Hotel</ENAMEX> in downtown <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amman</ENAMEX>, the border crossings from
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jordan</ENAMEX> into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> holy sites, at a time when all these locations
                were likely to be thronged with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX>. Next, they would target
                a local <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX> and other religious and cultural <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hijazi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abu Hoshar</ENAMEX> cased
                the intended <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> and sent reports to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abu Zubaydah</ENAMEX>, who approved their plan.
                Finally, back in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amman</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hijazi</ENAMEX> gradually accumulated <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bomb</ENAMEX>-making
                materials, including <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfuric acid</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5,200 pounds</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nitric acid</ENAMEX>, which were then
                stored in an enormous subbasement dug by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">plotters</ENAMEX> over a period of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two months</TIMEX>
                underneath a rented <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>.
            
            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 1999</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hijazi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abu Hoshar</ENAMEX> contacted <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Khalil Deek</ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizen</ENAMEX> and
                an associate of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abu Zubaydah</ENAMEX> who lived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Peshawar</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>, and who, with
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">extremists</ENAMEX>, had created an electronic version of a terrorist
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">manual</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Encyclopedia of Jihad</ENAMEX>. They obtained a CD-ROM of this encyclopedia from
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deek</ENAMEX>.
            
            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June</TIMEX>, with help from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Deek</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abu Hoshar</ENAMEX> arranged with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abu Zubaydah</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hijazi</ENAMEX> and
                <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> others to go to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> for added training in handling explosives. In late
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November 1999</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hijazi</ENAMEX> reportedly swore before <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abu Zubaydah the bayat to Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>,
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">committing</ENAMEX> himself to do anything <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> ordered. He then departed for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jordan</ENAMEX> and
                was at a waypoint in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Syria</ENAMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abu Zubaydah</ENAMEX> sent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abu Hoshar</ENAMEX> the message that
                prompted <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jordanian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> to roll up the whole cell.
            
            After the arrests of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abu Hoshar</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> others, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jordanians</ENAMEX> tracked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deek</ENAMEX> to
                Peshawar, persuaded <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> to extradite him, and added him to their catch.
                Searches in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amman</ENAMEX> found the rented <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> and, among other things, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">71</NUMEX> drums of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>,
                several forged <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Saudi</ENAMEX> passports, detonators, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deek's Encyclopedia</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Six</NUMEX> of the
                accomplices were sentenced to death. In custody, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hijazi</ENAMEX>'s younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> said that
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>'s motto had been "The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX> is coming, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> will pile up in
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sacks</ENAMEX>."
            
            Diplomacy and Disruption
            On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 4</TIMEX>, as news came in about the discoveries in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jordan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Security</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Council</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSC</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Counterterrorism Coordinator Richard Clarke</ENAMEX> wrote <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX>, "If <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George</ENAMEX>'s
                [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tenet</ENAMEX>'s] story about a planned series of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">UBL attacks</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Millennium</ENAMEX> is true, we
                will need to make some decisions NOW." He told us he held several conversations with
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> during the crisis. He suggested threatening reprisals against the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> in the event of any attacks on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> interests, anywhere, by
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>. He further proposed to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX> that a strike be made during the last week
                of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX> against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camps</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>-a proposal not adopted.
            
            Warned by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> that the disrupted <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jordanian</ENAMEX> plot was probably part of a larger
                series of attacks intended for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the millennium</TIMEX>, some possibly involving chemical
                weapons, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Principals Committee</ENAMEX> met on <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the night</TIMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 8</TIMEX> and decided to task
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Counterterrorism Security Group</ENAMEX> (CSG) to develop plans to deter and disrupt
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> plots.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Sheehan</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSG</ENAMEX>, communicated warnings to the
                Taliban that they would be held responsible for future <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> attacks." <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike</ENAMEX> was
                not diplomatic," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> reported to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX>. With virtually no evidence of a Taliban
                response, a new approach was made to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">General</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anthony Zinni</ENAMEX>, the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commander</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central Command</ENAMEX> (CENTCOM), was designated as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX>'s special
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">envoy</ENAMEX> and sent to ask <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Musharraf</ENAMEX> to "take whatever action you deem necessary
                to resolve the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Bin Laden</ENAMEX> problem at the earliest possible time." But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zinni</ENAMEX> came back
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">emptyhanded</ENAMEX>. As <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Ambassador</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Milam</ENAMEX> reported from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Islamabad</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Musharraf</ENAMEX> was
                "unwilling to take the political heat at home."
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> worked hard with foreign security services to detain or at least keep an eye
                on suspected <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">associates</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tenet</ENAMEX> spoke to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> of his foreign counterparts.
                Disruption and arrest operations were mounted against <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">eight</TIMEX>
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>.
            
            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-December</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> signed a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Memorandum of Notification</ENAMEX> (MON) giving
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> broader authority to use foreign proxies to detain <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lieutenants</ENAMEX>,
                without having to transfer them to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> custody. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">authority</ENAMEX> was to capture, not
                kill, though lethal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> might be used if necessary<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.16</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tenet</ENAMEX> would later send a
                message to all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> overseas, saying, "The threat could not be more real. .
                . . Do whatever is necessary to disrupt <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UBL</ENAMEX>'s plans. . . . The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are
                counting on you and me to take every appropriate step to protect them during this
                period." The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX> issued a worldwide threat advisory to its posts
                    overseas.
            
            Then, on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 14</TIMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Algerian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jihadist</ENAMEX> was caught bringing a load of explosives
                into the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ressam</ENAMEX>'s Arrest
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ahmed Ressam</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>, had illegally immigrated to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX>. Using a falsified
                passport and a bogus story about persecution in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Algeria</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ressam</ENAMEX> entered <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Montreal</ENAMEX> and
                claimed political asylum. For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next few years</TIMEX> he supported himself with petty
                crime. Recruited by an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alumnus</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abu Zubaydah's Khaldan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camp</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ressam</ENAMEX> trained in
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>, learning, among other things, how to place cyanide near the air
                intake of a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> to achieve maximum lethality at minimum personal risk. Having
                joined other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Algerians</ENAMEX> in planning a possible attack on a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX> or consulate,
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ressam</ENAMEX> left <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 1999</TIMEX> carrying precursor <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemicals</ENAMEX> for explosives
                disguised in toiletry bottles, a notebook containing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bomb</ENAMEX> assembly instructions, and
                <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$12,000</NUMEX>. Back in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>, he went about procuring <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemicals</ENAMEX>, and false
                    papers.
            
            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early summer 1999</TIMEX>, having learned that not all of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> could get the
                travel documents to enter <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ressam</ENAMEX> decided to carry out the plan alone. By the
                end of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX> he had chosen <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles-area</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airports</ENAMEX> as potential
                targets, ultimately fixing on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los Angeles International</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAX</ENAMEX>) as the largest and
                easiest to operate in surreptitiously. He bought or stole chemicals and equipment
                for his <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bomb</ENAMEX>, obtaining advice from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Algerian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>, all of whom were wanted
                by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> for their roles in past terrorist attacks there. Ressam
                also acquired new confederates. He promised to help a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partner</ENAMEX>,
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abdelghani Meskini</ENAMEX>, get training in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meskini</ENAMEX> would help him maneuver
                in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>.
            
            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 1999</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ressam</ENAMEX> began his final preparations. He called an <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>-based
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">facilitator</ENAMEX> to inquire into whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> wanted to take credit for the attack,
                but he did not get a reply. He spent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a week</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vancouver</ENAMEX> preparing the explosive
                components with a close <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemicals</ENAMEX> were so caustic that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> kept
                their windows open, despite the freezing temperatures outside, and sucked on cough
                drops to soothe their irritated throats.
            
            While in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vancouver</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ressam</ENAMEX> also rented a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chrysler</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">sedan</ENAMEX> for his travel into the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX>, and packed the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">explosives</ENAMEX> in the trunk's spare tire <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">well</ENAMEX>.
            
            On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 14, 1999</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ressam</ENAMEX> drove his rental car onto the ferry from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Victoria</ENAMEX>,
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>, to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Port Angeles</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ressam</ENAMEX> planned to drive to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Seattle</ENAMEX> and meet
                Meskini, with whom he would travel to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> and case
            A <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Case Study in Terrorist Travel</ENAMEX>
            Following a familiar terrorist pattern, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ressam</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">associates</ENAMEX> used fraudulent
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">passports</ENAMEX> and immigration fraud to travel. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ressam</ENAMEX>'s case, this involved flying
                from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Montreal</ENAMEX> using a photo-substituted <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> passport under a false
                name. Under questioning, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ressam</ENAMEX> admitted the passport was fraudulent and claimed
                political asylum. He was released pending a hearing, which he failed to attend. His
                political asylum claim was denied. He was arrested again, released again, and given
                another hearing date. Again, he did not show. He was arrested <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> times for
                thievery, usually from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX>, but was neither jailed nor deported. He also
                supported himself by selling stolen documents to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> who was a document broker
                for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Islamist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX>.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ressam</ENAMEX> eventually obtained a genuine <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> passport through a document <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vendor</ENAMEX> who
                stole a blank baptismal certificate from a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Catholic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>. With this document he
                was able to obtain a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> passport under the name of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Benni Antoine Noris</ENAMEX>. This
                enabled him to travel to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>, and from there to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> for his training,
                and then return to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>. Impressed, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abu Zubaydah</ENAMEX> asked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ressam</ENAMEX> to get more genuine
                <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> passports and to send them to him for other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX> to use.
            
            Another conspirator, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abdelghani Meskini</ENAMEX>, used a stolen identity to travel to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Seattle</ENAMEX>
                on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 11, 1999</TIMEX>, at the request of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mokhtar Haouari</ENAMEX>, another conspirator.
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Haouari</ENAMEX> provided fraudulent passports and visas to assist <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ressam</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meskini</ENAMEX>'s
                planned getaway from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Algeria</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>.
            
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Meskini</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">associates</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abdel HakimTizegha</ENAMEX>, also filed a claim for political
                asylum. He was released pending a hearing, which was adjourned and rescheduled <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>
                times. His claim was finally denied <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</TIMEX> after his initial filing. His <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX>
                appealed the decision, andTizegha was allowed to remain in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> pending the
                appeal. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Nine months later</TIMEX>, his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> notified the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> that he could not locate
                his client. A warrant of deportation was issued.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LAX</ENAMEX>. They planned to detonate the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bomb</ENAMEX> on or around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 1, 2000</TIMEX>. At the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Immigration and Naturalization Service</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INS</ENAMEX>) preinspection <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Victoria</ENAMEX>,
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ressam</ENAMEX> presented <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> with his genuine but fraudulently obtained <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canadian</ENAMEX>
                passport, from which he had torn the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> entry and exit stamps. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INS</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> on duty ran the passport through a variety of databases but, since it was not
                in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ressam</ENAMEX>'s name, he did not pick up the pending <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> arrest warrants. After a
                cursory examination of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ressam</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> allowed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ressam</ENAMEX> to board the
                    ferry.
            
            Late in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the afternoon</TIMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 14</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ressam</ENAMEX> arrived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Port Angeles</ENAMEX>. He waited for
                all the other <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> to depart the ferry, assuming (incorrectly) that the last <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> off
                would draw less scrutiny. Customs <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> assigned to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">port</ENAMEX>, noticing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ressam</ENAMEX>'s
                nervousness, referred him to secondary inspection. When asked for additional
                identification, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ressam</ENAMEX> handed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Customs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Price Costco</ENAMEX> membership card in
                the same false name as his passport. As that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> began an initial pat-down, Ressam
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">panicked</ENAMEX> and tried to run away.
            
            Inspectors examining <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ressam</ENAMEX>'s rental car found the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">explosives concealed</ENAMEX> in the spare
                tire well, but at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> they assumed the white <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">powder</ENAMEX> and viscous liquid were
                drug-related-until an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inspector</ENAMEX> pried apart and identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> timing
                devices concealed within black boxes. Ressam was placed under arrest. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Investigators</ENAMEX>
                guessed his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX> was in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Seattle</ENAMEX>. They did not learn about the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> airport
                planning until they reexamined evidence seized in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Montreal</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>; they obtained
                further details when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ressam</ENAMEX> began cooperating in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 2001</TIMEX>.
            
            Emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cooperation</ENAMEX>
            After the disruption of the plot in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amman</ENAMEX>, it had not escaped notice in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>
                that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hijazi</ENAMEX> had lived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> and driven a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cab</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX> and that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Deek</ENAMEX> was a
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">naturalized U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizen</ENAMEX> who, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX> reminded <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>, had been in
                touch with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">extremists</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> as well as abroad.
            
            Before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ressam</ENAMEX>'s arrest, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX> saw no need to raise a public alarm at home- although
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> put all field <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> on alert.
            
            Now, following <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ressam</ENAMEX>'s arrest, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> asked for an unprecedented number of special
                wiretaps. Both <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX> andTenet told us that their impression was that more Foreign
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelligence Surveillance Act</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FISA</ENAMEX>) wiretap requests were processed during the
                millennium alert than ever before.
            
            The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next day</TIMEX>, writing about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ressam</ENAMEX>'s arrest and links to a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Montreal</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Berger</ENAMEX>
                informed the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> would advise <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> to step
                up activities but would still try to avoid undue public alarm by stressing that the
                government had no specific information about planned attacks.
            
            At a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 22</TIMEX> meeting of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Small Group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principals</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis Freeh</ENAMEX>
                briefed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice</ENAMEX> on wiretaps and
                investigations inside the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, including a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brooklyn</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> tied to the
                Ressam arrest, a seemingly unreliable foreign report of possible attacks on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Algerians</ENAMEX> detained on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> border, and searches in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Montreal</ENAMEX>
                related to a jihadist <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX> released a statement on the alert
                the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">same day</TIMEX>.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> warned, "Foreign terrorist sleeper cells are present in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> and
                attacks in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> are likely." <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> asked <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX> to try
                to make sure that the domestic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> remained alert." Is there a threat to
                civilian <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>?"he wrote. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> also asked the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principals</ENAMEX> in late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December</TIMEX> to
                discuss a foreign security <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">service</ENAMEX> report about a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> plan to put bombs on
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transatlantic</ENAMEX> flights.
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSG</ENAMEX> met <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX> said that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principals</ENAMEX> met constantly.
            
            Later, when asked what made her decide to ask <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ressam</ENAMEX> to step out of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicle</ENAMEX>,
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diana Dean</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Customs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inspector</ENAMEX> who referred <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ressam</ENAMEX> to secondary inspection,
                testified that it was her "training and experience." It
                appears that the heightened sense of alert at the national level played no role in
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ressam</ENAMEX>'s detention.
            There was a mounting sense of public alarm. The earlier <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jordanian</ENAMEX> arrests had been
                covered in the press, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ressam</ENAMEX>'s arrest was featured on network <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</TIMEX> news
                broadcasts throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Christmas season</TIMEX>.
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> was more communicative during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the millennium</TIMEX> crisis than it had ever been.
                The senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> for counterterrorism, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dale Watson</ENAMEX>, was a regular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSG</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> had good relations both with him and with some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">handling al Qaeda</ENAMEX>-related investigations, including <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John O'Neill</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>. As a
                rule, however, neither <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Watson</ENAMEX> nor these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> brought much information to the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> simply did not produce the kind of intelligence reports that other
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> routinely wrote and disseminated. As law enforcement <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bureau</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> tended to write up only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witness</ENAMEX> interviews. Written case analysis usually
                occurred only in memoranda to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supervisors</ENAMEX> requesting authority to initiate or expand
                an investigation.
            
            But during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the millennium</TIMEX> alert, with its direct links into the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> from
                Hijazi, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Deek</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ressam</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> were briefing in person about ongoing
                investigations, not relying on the dissemination of written reports. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX> told us
                that it was hard for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> to hold back information in front of a
                cabinet-rank <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. After the alert, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSC</ENAMEX>
                staff, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> returned to its normal practice of withholding written reports and
                saying little about investigations or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witness</ENAMEX> interviews, taking the position that
                any information related to pending investigations might be presented to a grand jury
                and hence could not be disclosed under thenprevailing federal law.
            
            The terrorist plots that were broken up at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of 1999</TIMEX> display the variety of
                operations that might be attributed, however indirectly, to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jordanian</ENAMEX>
                cell was a loose <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">affiliate</ENAMEX>; we now know that it sought approval and training from
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> key <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> swore loyalty to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>. But the cell's
                plans and preparations were autonomous. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ressam</ENAMEX>'s ties to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> were even looser.
                Though he had been recruited, trained, and prepared in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> affiliated with the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX> and its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">allies</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ressam</ENAMEX>'s own plans were, nonetheless, essentially
                independent.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Qaeda</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> himself, did have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX> of their very own in
                mind for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the millennium</TIMEX> period. In <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">chapter 5</ENAMEX> we introduced an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> operative
                named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nashiri</ENAMEX>. Working with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>, he was developing a plan to attack a ship
                near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX>. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 3</TIMEX>, an attempt was made to attack a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>warship in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Aden</ENAMEX>, the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">USS The Sullivans</ENAMEX>. The attempt failed when the small <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX>, overloaded with
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">explosives</ENAMEX>, sank. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX> salvaged their equipment without the attempt
                becoming known, and they put off their plans for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">another day</TIMEX>.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Qaeda</ENAMEX>'s "<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX>" was also coming along. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 2000</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX> caught a glimpse of its preparations.
            A <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lost Trail</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southeast Asia</ENAMEX>
            In late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Security Agency</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSA</ENAMEX>) analyzed communications associated
                with a suspected terrorist <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Middle East</ENAMEX>, indicating that several
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of "an operational cadre" were planning to travel to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuala Lumpur</ENAMEX> in early
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 2000</TIMEX>. Initially, only the first names of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> were
                known-"<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nawaf</ENAMEX>,""<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salem</ENAMEX>,"and"<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Khalid</ENAMEX>." <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> surmised correctly that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Salem</ENAMEX> was
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nawaf</ENAMEX> 's younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX>. Seeing links not only with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> but specifically with
                the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX> embassy bombings, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> desk <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> guessed that "something more nefarious
                [was] afoot."
            
            In <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">chapter 5</ENAMEX>, we discussed the dispatch of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> for
                their part in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX> operation-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nawaf al Hazmi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Khalid al Mihdhar</ENAMEX>. Two more,
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Khallad</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abu Bara</ENAMEX>, went to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southeast Asia</ENAMEX> to case flights for the part of the
                operation that was supposed to unfold there.
            
            All made their way to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southeast Asia</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>, except for
                Mihdhar, who traveled from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX>.
            
            Though <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nawaf</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">trail</ENAMEX> was temporarily lost, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> soon identified"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Khalid</ENAMEX>" as Khalid
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Mihdhar</ENAMEX>.
            
            He was located leaving <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX> and tracked until he arrived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuala Lumpur</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January</TIMEX>
                <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2000.45</NUMEX> Other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arabs</ENAMEX>, unidentified at the time, were watched as they gathered with
                him in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Malaysian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX>.
            
            On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 8</TIMEX>, the surveillance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> reported that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arabs</ENAMEX> had suddenly
                left <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuala Lumpur</ENAMEX> on a short flight to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bangkok</ENAMEX>.
            
            They identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mihdhar</ENAMEX>. They later learned that one of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">companions</ENAMEX> was
                named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alhazmi</ENAMEX>, although it was not yet known that he was "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nawaf</ENAMEX>." The only
                identifier available for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> was part of a name-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Salahsae</ENAMEX>.
            
            In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bangkok</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> received the information too late to track the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> as
                they came in, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">travelers</ENAMEX> disappeared into the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bangkok</ENAMEX>.
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Counterterrorist Center</ENAMEX> (CTC) had briefed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> on the gathering in
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuala Lumpur</ENAMEX>, and the information had been passed on to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> and
                to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Freeh</ENAMEX> and others at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> (though the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> noted that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> had the
                lead and would let the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> know if a domestic angle arose). The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bin</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ladin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> kept providing updates, unaware at first even that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arabs</ENAMEX> had left
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuala Lumpur</ENAMEX>, let alone that their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">trail</ENAMEX> had been lost in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bangkok</ENAMEX>.
            
            When this bad news arrived, the names were put on a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Thai</ENAMEX> watchlist so that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Thai</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> could inform the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> if any of them departed from
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Thailand</ENAMEX>.
            
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Several weeks later</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuala Lumpur</ENAMEX> prodded <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bangkok</ENAMEX> for
                additional information regarding the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">travelers</ENAMEX>.
            
            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early March 2000</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bangkok</ENAMEX> reported that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nawaf al Hazmi</ENAMEX>, now identified for the
                <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time with his full name, had departed on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 15</TIMEX> on a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Airlines</ENAMEX>
                flight to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>. As for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Khalid al Mihdhar</ENAMEX>, there was no report of his
                departure even though he had accompanied <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hazmi</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX> flight to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los</ENAMEX>
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Angeles</ENAMEX>.
            
            No one outside of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Counterterrorist Center</ENAMEX> was told any of this. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> did not
                try to register <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mihdhar</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TIPOFF</ENAMEX> watchlist-either
                in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January</TIMEX>, when word arrived of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mihdhar</ENAMEX>'s visa, or in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX>, when word came that
                Hazmi, too, had had a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> visa and a ticket to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>.
            
            None of this information-about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mihdhar</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> visa or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX>'s travel to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX>-went to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>, and nothing more was done to track any of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> until
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 2001</TIMEX>, when the investigation of another bombing, that of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">USS Cole</ENAMEX>,
                reignited interest in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Khallad</ENAMEX>. We will return to that story in chapter 8.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">POST-CRISIS REFLECTION</ENAMEX>: AGENDA FOR <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>
            After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the millennium</TIMEX> alert, elements of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> reviewed their
                performance. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> was told that while a number of plots had been
                disrupted, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the millennium</TIMEX> might be only the "kick-off " for a period of extended
                    attacks.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> wrote <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 11, 2000</TIMEX>, that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSC</ENAMEX>
                staff had come to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> main conclusions. First, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> disruption efforts thus far had
                "not put too much of a dent" in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>'s network. If the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> wanted to
                "roll back" the threat, disruption would have to proceed at "a markedly different
                tempo." <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>,"sleeper cells" and "a variety of terrorist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>" had turned up at
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX>.
            
            As one of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> noted, only a "chance discovery" by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Customs</ENAMEX> had
                prevented a possible attack.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX> gave his approval for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> to commence an "afteraction review,"
                anticipating new budget requests. He also asked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DCI Tenet</ENAMEX> to review the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>'s
                counterterrorism strategy and come up with a plan for"where we go from here."
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> advised <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> had only been "nibbling at the
                edges" of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> and that more terror attacks were a question not of
                "if "but rather of "when"and "where."59The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Principals Committee</ENAMEX> met on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 10</TIMEX>,
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>, to review possible new moves. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principals</ENAMEX> ended up agreeing that the
                government should take <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> major steps. First, more money should go to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> to
                accelerate its efforts to "seriously attrit" <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, there should be a
                crackdown on foreign terrorist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>,
                immigration law enforcement should be strengthened, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INS</ENAMEX> should tighten
                controls on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> border (including stepping up <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> cooperation). The
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">principals</ENAMEX> endorsed the proposed programs; some, like expanding the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joint</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Terrorism Task Forces</ENAMEX>, moved forward, and others, like creating a centralized
                translation <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> for domestic intelligence intercepts in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Arabic</ENAMEX> and other languages,
                did not.
            
            Pressing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pakistan</ENAMEX>
            While this process moved along, diplomacy continued its rounds. Direct pressure on
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX> had proved unsuccessful. As <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> note put it,
            "Under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> is not so much a state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sponsor</ENAMEX> of terrorism as it is
                a state sponsored by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX>." In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 2000</TIMEX>, the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX> began a high-level effort to persuade <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> to use its influence
                over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 2000</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Assistant Secretary of State</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karl Inderfurth</ENAMEX> and
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX>'s counterterrorism <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coordinator</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Sheehan</ENAMEX>, met with
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Musharraf</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Islamabad</ENAMEX>, dangling before him the possibility of a
                presidential visit in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX> as a reward for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pakistani</ENAMEX> cooperation. Such a visit was
                coveted by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Musharraf</ENAMEX>, partly as a sign of his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>'s legitimacy. He told the
                <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">envoys</ENAMEX> that he would meet with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mullah Omar</ENAMEX> and press him on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>. They
                left, however, reporting to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> was unlikely in fact to do
                anything," given what it sees as the benefits of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX> control of
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>."
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> was scheduled to travel to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX> felt that he
                should not visit <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> without also visiting <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Secret Service</ENAMEX> and the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>, however, warned in the strongest terms that visiting <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> would risk the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX>'s life. Counterterrorism <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> also argued that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> had not done
                enough to merit a presidential visit. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> insisted on including
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> in the itinerary for his trip to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Asia</ENAMEX>.
            
            His <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one-day</TIMEX> stopover on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 25, 2000</TIMEX>, was the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> had been
                there since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1969</TIMEX>. At his meeting with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Musharraf</ENAMEX> and others, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>
                concentrated on tensions between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> and the dangers of nuclear
                proliferation, but also discussed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> told us that when he
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pulled Musharraf</ENAMEX> aside for a brief, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one-on-one</NUMEX> meeting, he pleaded with the general
                for help regarding <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>." I offered him the moon when I went to see him, in
                terms of better relations with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, if he'd help us get <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> and
                deal with another issue or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>."
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> effort continued. Early in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> urged <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Musharraf</ENAMEX> to carry
                through on his promise to visit <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> and press <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mullah</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Omar</ENAMEX> to expel <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bin</ENAMEX>
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ladin</ENAMEX>.
            
            At <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the month</TIMEX>, Under <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary of State</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Pickering</ENAMEX> followed up with a
                trip to the region.
            
            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DCI Tenet</ENAMEX> traveled to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> with the same general message.
            
            By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> was becoming openly critical of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> for
                supporting a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Taliban</ENAMEX> military offensive aimed at completing the conquest of
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>.
            
            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December</TIMEX>, taking a step proposed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">some months earlier</TIMEX>, the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX> led a campaign for new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UN</ENAMEX> sanctions, which resulted in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UN Security</ENAMEX>
                Council Resolution <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1333</TIMEX>, again calling for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>'s expulsion and forbidding any
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> to provide the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX> or military assistance.
            
            This, too, had little if any effect. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX> did not expel <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Pakistani</ENAMEX>
                arms continued to flow across the border.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madeleine Albright</ENAMEX> told us, "We did not have a strong hand to play
                with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pakistanis</ENAMEX>. Because of the sanctions required by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> law, we had few
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">carrots</ENAMEX> to offer." <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> had blocked most economic and
                military aid to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> because of that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>'s nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX> program and
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Musharraf</ENAMEX> 's coup. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sheehan</ENAMEX> was critical of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Musharraf</ENAMEX>, telling us that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pakistani</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> "blew a chance to remake <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>."
            
            Building <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Capabilities</ENAMEX>: The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>
            The after-action review had treated the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> as the lead <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> for any offensive
                against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principals</ENAMEX>, at their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 10</TIMEX> meeting, had endorsed
                strengthening the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>'s capability for that role. To the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CTC</ENAMEX>, that meant proceeding
                with "the Plan," which it had put forward <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year earlier</TIMEX>-hiring and training
                more case <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> and building up the capabilities of foreign security services
                that provided intelligence via liaison. On occasion, as in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jordan</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 1999</TIMEX>,
                these liaison services took direct action against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> cells.
            
            In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CTC</ENAMEX> and higher up, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> believed that they desperately needed
                funds just to continue their current counterterrorism effort, for they reckoned that
                the millennium alert had already used up all of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center</ENAMEX>'s funds for the current
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year</TIMEX>; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> had spent <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">140 percent</NUMEX> of its allocation. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tenet</ENAMEX> told
                us he met with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX> to discuss funding for counterterrorism <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">just two days</TIMEX> after
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principals</ENAMEX>' meeting.
            
            While <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> strongly favored giving the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> more money for counterterrorism, he
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differed</ENAMEX> sharply with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> about where it should come from. They
                insisted that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> had been shortchanged ever since the end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Cold War</ENAMEX>.
                Their ability to perform any mission, counterterrorism included, they argued,
                depended on preserving what they had, restoring what they had lost since the
                beginning of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1990s</TIMEX>, and building from there-with across-the-board recruitment
                and training of new case <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX>, and the reopening of closed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stations</ENAMEX>. To finance
                the counterterrorism effort, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tenet</ENAMEX> had gone to congressional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> after the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">embassy</ENAMEX> bombings and persuaded them to give the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> a special supplemental
                appropriation. Now, in the aftermath of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the millennium</TIMEX> alert, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tenet</ENAMEX> wanted a boost
                in overall funds for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> and another supplemental appropriation specifically for
                    counterterrorism.
            
            To <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX>, this seemed evidence that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> did not give sufficient
                priority to the battle against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>. He told us that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Pavitt</ENAMEX>,
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Directorate of Operations</ENAMEX>, "said if there's going to be money
                spent on going after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>, it should be given to him. . . . My view was that he
                had had a lot of money to do it and a long time to do it, and I didn't want to put
                more good money after bad."
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> had a very different attitude: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pavitt</ENAMEX> told us that while the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>
                unit did"extraordinary and commendable work," his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> of station in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> "was
                just as much part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> struggle as an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> sitting in [the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>
                    unit]."
            
            The dispute had large managerial implications, for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> had found <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">allies</ENAMEX> in the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office of Management and Budget</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX>). They had supplied him with the figures he
                used to argue that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> spending on counterterrorism from its baseline budget had
                shown almost no increase.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX> met twice with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tenet</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX> to try to resolve the dispute. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deputies</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Committee</ENAMEX> met <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later in the month</TIMEX> to review <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 2000 and 2001</TIMEX> budget
                priorities and offsets for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end</TIMEX>,
            Tenet obtained a modest supplemental appropriation, which funded counterterrorism
                without requiring much reprogramming of baseline funds. But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> still believed
                that it remained underfunded for counterterrorism.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Terrorist Financing</ENAMEX>
            The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> major point on which the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principals</ENAMEX> had agreed on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 10</TIMEX> was the need to
                crack down on terrorist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> and curtail their fund-raising. The embassy
                bombings of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX> had focused attention on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>'s finances. One result had been
                the creation of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSC</ENAMEX>-led interagency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committee</ENAMEX> on terrorist financing. On its
                recommendation, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> had designated <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> as subject to
                sanctions under the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">International Emergency Economic Powers Act</ENAMEX>. This gave
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">theTreasury Department</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office of Foreign Assets Control</ENAMEX> (OFAC) the ability to
                search for and freeze any <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> assets that reached the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
                financial system. But since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OFAC</ENAMEX> had little information to go on, few funds were
                    frozen.
            
            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 1999</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> applied the same designation to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX> for harboring
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>. Here, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OFAC</ENAMEX> had more success. It blocked <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $34 million</NUMEX> in Taliban
                assets held in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX>. Another <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$215 million</NUMEX> in gold and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2 million</NUMEX> in demand
                deposits, all belonging to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Afghan</ENAMEX> central bank and held by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Reserve</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bank of New York</ENAMEX>, were also frozen.
            
            After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 1999</TIMEX>, when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX> formally designated <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> a "foreign
                terrorist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>," it became the duty of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX> to block its transactions
                and seize its funds.
            
            Neither this designation nor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UN</ENAMEX> sanctions had much additional practical effect; the
                sanctions were easily circumvented, and there were no multilateral mechanisms to
                ensure that other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>' financial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">systems</ENAMEX> were not used as conduits for
                terrorist funding.
            
            Attacking the funds of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX>, even the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX>, was easier than finding and
                seizing the funds of a clandestine worldwide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>. Although
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> had originally been inspired by the idea of studying
                terrorist financial links, few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> assigned to it had any experience in
                financial investigations. Any terrorist-financing intelligence appeared to have been
                collected collaterally, as a consequence of gathering other intelligence. This
                attitude may have stemmed in large part from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> of this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX>, who did not
                believe that simply following the money from point A to point B revealed much about
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX>' plans and intentions. As a result, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> placed little emphasis on
                terrorist financing.
            
            Nevertheless, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> obtained a general understanding of how <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> raised money.
                It knew relatively early, for example, about the loose affiliation of financial
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX>, and wealthy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> who supported <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">extremist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Islamic</ENAMEX>
                    activities.
            
            Much of the early reporting on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>'s financial situation and its structure came
                from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jamal Ahmed al Fadl</ENAMEX>, whom we have mentioned earlier in the report.
            
            After the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX> embassy bombings, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> tried to develop a clearer
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">picture of Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>'s finances. A <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> interagency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> traveled to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX>
                twice, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999 and 2000</TIMEX>, to get information from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saudis</ENAMEX> about their
                understanding of those finances. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> eventually concluded that the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">oft-</ENAMEX>repeated assertion that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> was funding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> from his personal fortune
                was in fact not true. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> developed a new theory: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> was getting its
                money elsewhere, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> needed to focus on other sources of funding,
                such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">charities</ENAMEX>, wealthy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX>, and financial facilitators. Ultimately, although
                the intelligence <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">community</ENAMEX> devoted more resources to the issue and produced somewhat
                more intelligence, it remained difficult to distinguish
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>'s financial transactions among the vast sums moving in the international
                financial system. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> was not able to find or disrupt <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>'s money
                    flows.
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> thought that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> possible solution to these weaknesses in the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intelligence</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> was to create an all-source terrorist-financing intelligence
                analysis <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> pushed for the funding of such a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX>, but
                neither <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> nor the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> was willing to commit the resources.
            
            Within the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, various <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> field <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> gathered intelligence on
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">organizations</ENAMEX> suspected of raising funds for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> or other terrorist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. By
                <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> understood that there were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">extremist organizations</ENAMEX> operating within
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> supporting a global jihadist movement and with substantial
                connections to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> operated a web of informants, conducted electronic
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">surveillance</ENAMEX>, and had opened significant investigations in a number of field
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Detroit</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minneapolis</ENAMEX>. On a
                national level, however, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> never used the information to gain a systematic or
                strategic understanding of the nature and extent of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> fundraising.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX>, as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">financial institutions</ENAMEX>, were generally focused
                on finding and deterring or disrupting the vast flows of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> currency generated by
                drug trafficking and high-level international fraud. Large-scale scandals, such as
                the use of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bank of New York</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">money launderers</ENAMEX> to move <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of
                dollars out of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX>, captured the attention of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of the Treasury</ENAMEX> and
                of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>.
            
            Before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9/11</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> did not consider terrorist financing important enough to
                mention in its national strategy for money laundering.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Border Security</ENAMEX>
            The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> point on which the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principals</ENAMEX> had agreed on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 10</TIMEX> was the need for
                attention to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>'s porous borders and the weak enforcement of immigration laws.
                Drawing on ideas from government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX>'s working <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> developed a menu
                of proposals to bolster border security. Some reworked or reiterated previous
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">presidential</ENAMEX> directives.
            
            They included 
            
                creating an interagency <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> to target illegal entry and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">human traffickers</ENAMEX>;
                imposing tighter controls on student visas;
                
                taking legal action to prevent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX> from coming into the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>
                    and to remove those already here, detaining them while awaiting removal
                        proceedings;
                
                further increasing the number of immigration <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI JointTerrorism Task</ENAMEX>
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Forces</ENAMEX> to help investigate immigration charges against <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> suspected of
                        terrorism;
                
                activating a special <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> to enable the use of classified evidence in
                    immigration-related national security cases; and
                both implementing new security measures for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> passports and working with
                    the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Nations</ENAMEX> and foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> to raise global security standards
                    for travel documents.
                
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX>'s working <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> compiled new proposals as well, such as 
            
                undertaking a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joint Perimeter Defense</ENAMEX> program with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> to establish
                    cooperative intelligence and law enforcement programs, leading to joint
                    operations based on shared visa and immigration data and joint border <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patrols</ENAMEX>;
                staffing land border <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">crossings 24/7</NUMEX> and equipping them with video cameras,
                    physical barriers, and means to detect <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX> of mass destruction (WMD); and
                addressing the problem of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">migrants</ENAMEX>-possibly including <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX>- who destroy
                    their travel documents so they cannot be returned to their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> of
                        origin.
                
            
            These proposals were praiseworthy in principle. In practice, however, they required
                action by weak, chronically underfunded executive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> and powerful
                congressional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committees</ENAMEX>, which were more responsive to well-organized interest
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> than to executive branch interagency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committees</ENAMEX>. The changes sought by the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principals</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 2000</TIMEX> were only beginning to occur before 9/11.
            "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Afghan Eyes</ENAMEX>"
            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early March 2000</TIMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> received an update on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>covert action
                efforts against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>, he wrote in the memo's margin that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>
                could surely do better. Military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joint Staff</ENAMEX> told us that they
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">shared</ENAMEX> this sense of frustration. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> used the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX>'s comment to push the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSG</ENAMEX> to brainstorm new ideas, including aid to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern Alliance</ENAMEX>.
            
            Back in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 1999</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern Alliance</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ahmed Shah Massoud</ENAMEX> had offered to
                stage a rocket attack against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Derunta</ENAMEX> training <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Officers</ENAMEX> at the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> had worried that giving him a green light might cross the line into violation of
                the assassination ban. Hence, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Massoud</ENAMEX> was told not to take any such action without
                explicit <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> authorization.
            
            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the spring of 2000</TIMEX>, after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> had sent out <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> to explore possible closer
                relationships with both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Uzbeks</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern Alliance</ENAMEX>, discussions took place
                in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">delegates</ENAMEX> sent by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Massoud</ENAMEX>.
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> agreed that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Massoud</ENAMEX> should get some modest technical help so he could
                work on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> priorities-collecting intelligence on and possibly acting against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qaeda</ENAMEX>. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Massoud</ENAMEX> wanted the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> both to become his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ally</ENAMEX> in trying to
                overthrow theTaliban and to recognize that they were fighting common <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enemies</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Clarke</ENAMEX>
                and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cofer Black</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Counterterrorist Center</ENAMEX>, wanted to take this next
                step. Proposals to help the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern Alliance</ENAMEX> had been debated in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
                government since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX> and, as we mentioned in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">chapter 4</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> as a
                whole had been wary of endorsing them, largely because of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern Alliance</ENAMEX>'s
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">checkered</ENAMEX> history, its limited base of popular support in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>, and
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>'s objections.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> also began pressing proposals to use their ties with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alliance</ENAMEX> to get <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> on the ground in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> for an extended period,
                setting up their own base for covert intelligence collection and activity in the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Panjshir Valley</ENAMEX> and lessening reliance on foreign proxies." There's no substitute
                for face-to-face," <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> told us.
            
            But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>'s institutional capacity for such direct action was weak, especially if
                it was not working jointly with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">military</ENAMEX>. The idea was turned down as too
                    risky.
            
            In the meantime, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> continued to work with its tribal assets in southern
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early August</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tribals</ENAMEX> reported an attempt to ambush <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>'s
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">convoy</ENAMEX> as he traveled on the road between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kabul</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kandahar city</ENAMEX>- their <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> such
                reported interdiction attempt in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than a year and a half</TIMEX>. But it was not a
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">success</ENAMEX>. According to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tribals</ENAMEX>' own account, when they approached one of the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vehicles</ENAMEX>, they quickly determined that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> were inside and called off
                the ambush. Conveying this information to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> noted that they had
                no independent corroboration for this incident, but that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tribals</ENAMEX> had acted
                within the terms of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>.
            
            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>, plans continued to be developed for potential military operations in
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX> that could launch <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missiles</ENAMEX> into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> were still on
                call in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">north Arabian Sea</ENAMEX>.
            
            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX>, the military refined its list of strikes and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Special Operations</ENAMEX>
                possibilities to a set of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> options within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Operation Infinite Resolve</ENAMEX>
                    plan.
            
            Yet planning efforts continued to be limited by the same operational and policy
                concerns encountered in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998 and 1999</TIMEX>. Although the intelligence <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> sometimes
                knew where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> was, it had been unable to provide intelligence considered
                sufficiently reliable to launch a strike. Above all, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> did not have
                <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> eyes on the target. As <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> put it, we had our hand on the
                door, but we couldn't open the door and walk in.
            
            At some point during this period, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> expressed his frustration with
                the lack of military options to take out <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX>,
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">remarking</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">General</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hugh Shelton</ENAMEX>, "You know, it would scare the shit out of
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al-Qaeda</ENAMEX> if suddenly a bunch of black ninjas rappelled out of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">helicopters</ENAMEX> into the
                middle of their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camp</ENAMEX>."<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">109</NUMEX> Although <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shelton</ENAMEX> told the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> he did not remember
                the statement, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> recalled this remark as "one of the many things I
                said." The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> added, however, that he realized nothing would be accomplished
                if he lashed out in anger. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Cohen</ENAMEX> thought that the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> might have been making a hypothetical statement. Regardless, he said, the
                question remained how to get the "ninjas" into and out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">theater</ENAMEX> of
                    operations.
            
            As discussed in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">chapter 4</ENAMEX>, plans of this kind were never carried out before 9/11.
            In late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 2000</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joint Staff</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of operations, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Vice Admiral</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scott Fry</ENAMEX>, directed his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief information operations officer</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brigadier General</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scott Gration</ENAMEX>, to develop innovative ways to get better intelligence on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>'s
                whereabouts. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gration</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> worked on a number of different ideas aimed at
                getting reliable <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> eyes on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> in a way that would reduce the lag time
                between sighting and striking.
            
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> option was to use a small, unmanned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Air Force</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">drone</ENAMEX> called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Predator</ENAMEX>,
                which could survey the territory below and send back video footage. Another
                option-eventually dismissed as impractical-was to place a powerful long-range
                telescope on a mountain within range of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>'s training <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camps</ENAMEX>. Both
                proposals were discussed with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Shelton</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joint Chiefs of</ENAMEX>
                Staff, and then briefed to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSG</ENAMEX> was
                searching for new ideas. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the spring of 2000</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> brought in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>'s
                assistant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> for collection, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Allen</ENAMEX>, to work together with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fry</ENAMEX> on a
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">joint CIA</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> effort that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> dubbed "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Afghan Eyes</ENAMEX>." After much argument between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense Department</ENAMEX> about
                who should pay for the program, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> eventually imposed a cost-sharing
                agreement. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> agreed to pay for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Predator</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> as a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60-day</TIMEX> "proof of
                concept" trial run.
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Small Group</ENAMEX> backed <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Afghan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Eyes</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of June 2000</TIMEX>. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-July</TIMEX>, testing was
                completed and the equipment was ready, but legal issues were still being ironed
                    out.
            
            By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 11</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principals</ENAMEX> had agreed to deploy the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Predator</ENAMEX>.
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> considered how to use the information the drones would be relaying from
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX>'s deputy, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger Cressey</ENAMEX>, wrote to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX> that emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSG</ENAMEX> and
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Principals Committee</ENAMEX> meetings might be needed to act on video coming in from the
                Predator if it proved able to lock in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>'s location. In the memo's margin,
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX> wrote that before considering action, "I will want more than verified
                location: we will need, at least, data on pattern of movements to provide some
                assurance he will remain in place." <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> was kept up to date.
            
            On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 7</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Predator</ENAMEX> flew for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX>
                saw video taken during the trial flight, he described the imagery to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX> as
                "truly astonishing," and he argued immediately for more flights seeking to find Bin
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ladin</ENAMEX> and target him for cruise <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missile</ENAMEX> or air attack. Even if <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> were not
                found, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> said, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Predator</ENAMEX> missions might identify additional worthwhile targets,
                such as other <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> or stocks of chemical or biological weapons.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> was not alone in his enthusiasm. He had backing from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cofer Black</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Charles</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allen</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Ten</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> trial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">missions</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Predator</ENAMEX> over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> were
                rated successful. On the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> flight, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Predator</ENAMEX> saw a security <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">detail</ENAMEX> around a
                tall <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> in a white robe at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Bin Ladin'sTarnak Farms</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">compound</ENAMEX> outside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kandahar</ENAMEX>. After
                a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> sighting of the "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> in white" at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">compound</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 28</TIMEX>,
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intelligence</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community analysts</ENAMEX> determined that he was probably <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>.
            
            During <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> trial mission, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX> spotted the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Predator</ENAMEX> and scrambled <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MiG</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fighters</ENAMEX> to try, without success, to intercept it. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX> worried that a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Predator</ENAMEX>
                might be shot down, and warned <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> that a shootdown would be a "bonanza" for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bin</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ladin</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX>.
            
            Still, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> was optimistic about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Predator</ENAMEX>-as well as progress with disruptions of
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> elsewhere. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX> was more cautious, praising the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> 's
                performance but observing that this was no time for complacency. "Unfortunately," he
                wrote, "the light at the end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tunnel</ENAMEX> is another <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tunnel</ENAMEX>."
            
            THE <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ATTACK ON THE USS COLE</ENAMEX>
            Early in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">chapter 5</ENAMEX> we introduced, along with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Khalid Sheikh Mohammed</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> other men
                who became operational coordinators for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Khallad</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nashiri</ENAMEX>. As we
                explained, both were involved during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998 and 1999</TIMEX> in preparing to attack a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ship</ENAMEX> off
                the coast of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX> with a boatload of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">explosives</ENAMEX>. They had originally targeted a
                commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessel</ENAMEX>, specifically an oil <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">tanker</ENAMEX>, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> urged them to look for
                a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">warship</ENAMEX> instead. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 2000</TIMEX>, their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> had attempted to attack a warship
                in the port of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Aden</ENAMEX>, but the attempt failed when the suicide boat sank. More than
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nine months later</TIMEX>, on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 12,2000</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX> in a small <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">boat</ENAMEX> laden
                with explosives attacked a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Navy</ENAMEX> destroyer, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">USS Cole</ENAMEX>. The blast ripped a
                hole in the side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cole</ENAMEX>, killing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ship</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crew</ENAMEX> and wounding at
                least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX>.
            
            The plot, we now know, was a full-fledged <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX>, supervised directly by
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>. He chose the target and location of the attack, selected the suicide
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">operatives</ENAMEX>, and provided the money needed to purchase <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">explosives</ENAMEX> and equipment.
                Nashiri was the field <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commander</ENAMEX> and managed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Khallad</ENAMEX> helped
                in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX> until he was arrested in a case of mistaken identity and freed with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bin</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ladin</ENAMEX>'s help, as we also mentioned <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX>. Local <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> coordinators included
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jamal al Badawi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fahd al Quso</ENAMEX>, who was supposed to film the attack from a nearby
                apartment. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> suicide <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX> chosen were <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hassan al Khamri</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ibrahim al</ENAMEX>
                Thawar, also known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nibras</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nibras</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quso</ENAMEX> delivered money to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Khallad</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bangkok</ENAMEX>
                during <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Khallad</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 2000</TIMEX> trip to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuala Lumpur</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bangkok</ENAMEX>.
            
            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 2000</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> reportedly told <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nashiri</ENAMEX> that he wanted to replace <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Khamri</ENAMEX>
                and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nibras</ENAMEX>. Nashiri was angry and disagreed, telling others he would go to
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> and explain to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> that the new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX> were already trained
                and ready to conduct the attack. Prior to departing, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nashiri</ENAMEX> gave <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nibras</ENAMEX> and Khamri
                instructions to execute the attack on the next <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>warship that entered the port of
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aden</ENAMEX>.
            
            While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nashiri</ENAMEX> was in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nibras</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Khamri</ENAMEX> saw their chance. They piloted
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">explosives</ENAMEX>-laden boat alongside the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">USS Cole</ENAMEX>, made friendly gestures to crew
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>, and detonated the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bomb</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quso</ENAMEX> did not arrive at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> in time to
                film the attack.
            
            Back in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> anticipated <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> military retaliation. He ordered the
                evacuation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kandahar</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport compound</ENAMEX> and fled- <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> to the desert
                area near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kabul</ENAMEX>, then to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Khowst</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jalalabad</ENAMEX>, and eventually back to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kandahar</ENAMEX>. In
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kandahar</ENAMEX>, he rotated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between five to six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residences</ENAMEX>, spending <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one night</TIMEX> at each
                residence. In addition, he sent his senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mohammed Atef</ENAMEX>, to a different
                part of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kandahar</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">deputy</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ayman al Zawahiri</ENAMEX>, to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kabul</ENAMEX> so that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> could
                not be killed in one attack.
            
            There was no <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> strike. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February 2001</TIMEX>, a source reported that an individual
                whom he identified as the big <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">instructor</ENAMEX> (probably a reference to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>)
                complained frequently that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> had not yet attacked. According to the
                source, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> wanted the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> to attack, and if it did not he would
                launch something bigger.
            
            The attack on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">USS Cole</ENAMEX> galvanized <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>'s recruitment efforts. Following the
                attack, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> instructed the media <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committee</ENAMEX>, then headed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Khalid Sheikh</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mohammed</ENAMEX>, to produce a propaganda video that included a reenactment of the attack
                along with images of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> training <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camps</ENAMEX> and training methods; it also
                highlighted <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX> suffering in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Palestine</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kashmir</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indonesia</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chechnya</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Al</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qaeda</ENAMEX>'s image was very important to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>, and the video was widely
                disseminated. Portions were aired on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Jazeera</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNN</ENAMEX>, and other television <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outlets</ENAMEX>.
                It was also disseminated among many young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX>, and caused
                many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">extremists</ENAMEX> to travel to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> for training and jihad. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Qaeda</ENAMEX> members
                considered the video an effective tool in their struggle for preeminence among other
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Islamist</ENAMEX> and jihadist movements.
            
            Investigating the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Attack</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Teams</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Naval Criminal Investigative Service</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> were
                immediately sent to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX> to investigate the attack. With difficulty, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barbara</ENAMEX>
                Bodine, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ambassador</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX>, tried to persuade the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Yemeni</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> to
                accept these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> and allow them to carry <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX>, though the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yemenis</ENAMEX> balked at
                letting <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> openly carry long <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">rifles</ENAMEX>, shotguns, automatic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX>).
                Meanwhile, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bodine</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John O'Neill</ENAMEX>, clashed
                repeatedly-to the point that after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O'Neill</ENAMEX> had been rotated out of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX> but wanted
                to return, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bodine</ENAMEX> refused the request. Despite the initial tension, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Yemeni</ENAMEX> and
                <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> investigations proceeded. Within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few weeks</TIMEX>, the outline of the story
                began to emerge.
            
            On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cole</ENAMEX> attack, a list of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">suspects</ENAMEX> was assembled that included <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qaeda's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">affiliate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Egyptian Islamic Jihad</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> counterterrorism <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> told us
                they immediately assumed that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> was responsible. But as Deputy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DCI John</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McLaughlin</ENAMEX> explained to us, it was not enough for the attack to smell, look, and
                taste like an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> operation. To make a case, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> needed not just a guess
                but a link to someone known to be an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> operative.
            
            Within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first weeks</TIMEX> after the attack, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yemenis</ENAMEX> found and arrested both Badawi
                and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quso</ENAMEX>, but did not let the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> participate in the interrogations. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>
                described initial <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Yemeni</ENAMEX> support after the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cole</ENAMEX> as "slow and inadequate." <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albright</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DCI Tenet</ENAMEX> all intervened to help. Because the
                information was secondhand, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> could not make its own assessment of its
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reliability</ENAMEX>.
            
            On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November 11</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yemenis</ENAMEX> provided the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> with new information from the
                interrogations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Badawi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quso</ENAMEX>, including descriptions of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> from whom
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">detainees</ENAMEX> had received operational direction. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of them was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Khallad</ENAMEX>, who was
                described as having lost his leg. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">detainees</ENAMEX> said that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Khallad</ENAMEX> helped direct the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cole</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yemenis</ENAMEX> (correctly) judged that the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> described as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Khallad</ENAMEX> was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tawfiq bin Attash</ENAMEX>.
            
            An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> special <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> recognized the name <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Khallad</ENAMEX> and connected this news with
                information from an important <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> who had been meeting regularly with
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">source</ENAMEX> had called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Khallad Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>'s "run boy," and
                described him as having lost <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> leg in an explosives accident at a training <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camp</ENAMEX> a
                few <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years earlier</TIMEX>. To confirm the identification, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> asked the Yemenis
                for their photo of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Khallad</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yemenis</ENAMEX> provided the photo on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November 22</TIMEX>,
                reaffirming their view that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Khallad</ENAMEX> had been an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intermediary</ENAMEX> between the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">plotters</ENAMEX>
                and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>. (In a meeting with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few weeks later</TIMEX>, on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 16</TIMEX>,
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> identified <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Khallad</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Yemeni</ENAMEX> photograph.)
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> intelligence <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> had already connected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Khallad</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> terrorist
                operations, including the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX> embassy bombings. By this time the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yemenis</ENAMEX> also had
                identified <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nashiri</ENAMEX>, whose links to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> and the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX> embassy bombings were even
                more well-known.
            
            In other words, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yemenis</ENAMEX> provided strong evidence connecting the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cole</ENAMEX> attack to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qaeda</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the second half of November</TIMEX>, identifying individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX> whom the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX> knew were part of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>. During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> was able
                to corroborate this evidence. But the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> did not have evidence about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bin</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ladin</ENAMEX>'s personal involvement in the attacks until <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nashiri</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Khallad</ENAMEX> were captured
                in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002 and 2003</TIMEX>.
            Considering a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Response</ENAMEX>
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cole</ENAMEX> attack prompted renewed consideration of what could be done about <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>.
                According to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX> upbraided <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DCITenet</ENAMEX> so sharply after the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cole</ENAMEX>
                attack-repeatedly demanding to know why the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> had to put up with such
                attacks-that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tenet</ENAMEX> walked out of a meeting of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principals</ENAMEX>.
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> got some additional covert action <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX>, adding several other
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> to the coverage of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 1999</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Memorandum of Notification</ENAMEX> that allowed
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> to develop capture <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> in a
                variety of places and circumstances. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tenet</ENAMEX> developed additional options, such as
                strengthening relationships with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern Alliance</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Uzbeks</ENAMEX> and slowing
                recent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>-related activities in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lebanon</ENAMEX>.
            
            On the diplomatic track, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX> agreed on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 30, 2000</TIMEX>, to let the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State</ENAMEX>
                Department make another approach toTaliban <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Deputy Foreign Minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abdul Jalil</ENAMEX> about
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">expelling Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>. The national security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisor</ENAMEX> ordered that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>message"be
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stern</ENAMEX> and foreboding." This warning was similar to those issued in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998 and 1999</TIMEX>.
                Meanwhile, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> was working with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> on new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UN</ENAMEX> sanctions against
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mullah</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Omar</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> told us that before he could launch further attacks on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> in
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>, or deliver an ultimatum to theTaliban threatening strikes if they did
                not immediately expel <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> had to be sure enough that they
                would "be willing to stand up in public and say, we believe that he [<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>] did
                this." He said he was very frustrated that he could not get a definitive enough
                answer to do something about the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cole</ENAMEX> attack.
            
            Similarly, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX> recalled that to go to war, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> needs to be able to say
                that his senior intelligence and law enforcement <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> have concluded who is
                responsible. He recalled that the intelligence <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> had strong suspicions, but
                had reached "no conclusion by the time we left <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> that it was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>."
            
            Our only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> for what intelligence <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> thought at the time are what they
                said in informal briefings. Soon after the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cole</ENAMEX> attack and for the remainder of the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> stopped distributing written reports about who was
                responsible. The topic was obviously sensitive, and both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Ambassador</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bodine</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX>
                and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> presumed that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> did not want reports
                circulating around the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> that might become public, impeding law enforcement
                actions or backing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> into a corner.
            
            Instead the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principals</ENAMEX> relied on informal updates as more
                evidence came in. Though <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> worried that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> might be equivocating in
                assigning responsibility to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>, he wrote <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November 7</TIMEX> that the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> had described their case by saying that "it has web feet, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">flies</ENAMEX>, and
                quacks." On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November 10</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> briefed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Small Group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principals</ENAMEX> on their
                preliminary findings that the attack was carried out by a cell of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Yemeni</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX>
                with some ties to the transnational <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mujahideen network</ENAMEX>. According to the briefing,
                these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX> likely had some support from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>. But the information on
                outside sponsorship, support, and direction of the operation was inconclusive. The
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next day</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> told <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> that while the investigation was
                continuing, it was becoming increasingly clear that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> had planned and
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">directed</ENAMEX> the bombing.
            
            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-November</TIMEX>, as the evidence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> involvement mounted, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX> asked
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Shelton</ENAMEX> to reevaluate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">military</ENAMEX> plans to act quickly against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>.
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Shelton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tasked General</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tommy Franks</ENAMEX>, the new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commander</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CENTCOM</ENAMEX>, to look
                again at the options. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shelton</ENAMEX> wanted to demonstrate that the military was
                imaginative and knowledgeable enough to move on an array of options, and to show the
                complexity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX>. He briefed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX> on the "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Infinite Resolve</ENAMEX>" strike
                options developed since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>, which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joint Staff</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CENTCOM</ENAMEX> had refined during
                the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> into a list of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> possibilities or combinations. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CENTCOM</ENAMEX> added a new
                "phased campaign"concept for wider-ranging strikes, including attacks against the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX>. For the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time, these strikes envisioned an air campaign against
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> of indefinite duration. Military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planners</ENAMEX> did not include contingency
                planning for an invasion of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>. The concept was briefed to Deputy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National</ENAMEX>
                Security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Advisor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Kerrick</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 20</TIMEX>, and to other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>.
            
            On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November 25</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> wrote <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> that although the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> and
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> investigations had not reached a formal conclusion, they believed the
                investigations would soon conclude that the attack had been carried out by a large
                cell whose senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> belonged to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>. Most of those involved had trained
                in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>-operated <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camps</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX> continued. So far, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> had
                not been tied personally to the attack and nobody had heard him directly order it,
                but <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> intelligence reports suggested that he was involved. When discussing
                possible responses, though, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX> referred to the premise-al Qaeda responsibility-
                as an "unproven assumption."
            
            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the same November 25</TIMEX> memo, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX> informed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> about a closely held
                idea: a last-chance ultimatum for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> was developing the idea with
                specific demands: immediate extradition of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lieutenants</ENAMEX> to a
                legitimate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> for trial, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">observable</TIMEX> closure of all terrorist <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> in
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>, and expulsion of all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">90 days</TIMEX>.
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Noncompliance</ENAMEX> would mean <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> "force directed at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX> itself " and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
                efforts to ensure that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX> would never defeat the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern Alliance</ENAMEX>. No such
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ultimatum</ENAMEX> was issued.
            
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Nearly a month later</TIMEX>, on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 21</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> made another presentation to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Small</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principals</ENAMEX> on the investigative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX>'s findings. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>'s briefing slides
                said that their "preliminary judgment" was that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> group
                "supported the attack" on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cole</ENAMEX>, based on strong circumstantial evidence tying
                key <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">perpetrators</ENAMEX> of the attack to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> listed the key <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">suspects</ENAMEX>,
                including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nashiri</ENAMEX>. In addition, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> detailed the timeline of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX>, from
                the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-1999</TIMEX> preparations, to the failed attack on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">USS The Sullivans</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January</TIMEX>
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3, 2000</TIMEX>, through a meeting held by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> before the attack.
            
            The slides said that so far the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> had "no definitive answer on [the] crucial
                question of outside direction of the attack-how and by whom." The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> noted that the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yemenis</ENAMEX> claimed that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Khallad</ENAMEX> helped direct the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> or
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>, possibly as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intermediary</ENAMEX>, but that it had not seen the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Yemeni</ENAMEX>
                evidence. However, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> knew from both human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> and signals intelligence
                that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Khallad</ENAMEX> was tied to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>. The prepared briefing concluded that while some
                reporting about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>'s role might have merit, those reports offered few
                specifics. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelligence</ENAMEX> gave some ambiguous indicators of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> direction of the
                    attack.
            
            This, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX> told us, was not the conclusion they needed in
                order to go to war or deliver an ultimatum to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Taliban</ENAMEX> threatening war. The
                election and change of power was not the issue, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> added. There was
                enough time. If the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> had given him a definitive answer, he said, he would
                have sought a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UN Security Council</ENAMEX> ultimatum and given the Taliban <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>, or three
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> before taking further action against both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX>. But he did
                not think it would be responsible for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> to launch an invasion of another
                country just based on a "preliminary judgment."
            
            Other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisers</ENAMEX> have echoed this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX>. Some of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albright</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisers</ENAMEX> warned
                her at the time to be sure the evidence conclusively linked <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cole</ENAMEX>
                before considering any response, especially a military one, because such action
                might inflame the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Islamic</ENAMEX> world and increase support for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX>. Defense
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cohen</ENAMEX> told us it would not have been prudent to risk killing civilians
                based only on an assumption that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> was responsible. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Shelton</ENAMEX> added
                that there was an outstanding question as to who was responsible and what the
                targets were.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> recalled that while the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX> had reservations
                about retaliation, the issue never came to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> never
                reached a firm conclusion. He thought they were "holding back." He said he did not
                know why, but his impression was that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tenet</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reno</ENAMEX> possibly thought the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> "didn't really want to know," since the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principals</ENAMEX>' discussions by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November</TIMEX>
                suggested that there was not much <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> interest in conducting further
                military <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last weeks</TIMEX>. He
                thought that, instead, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albright</ENAMEX> were
                concentrating on a lastminute push for a peace agreement between the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Palestinians</ENAMEX>
                and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israelis</ENAMEX>.
            
            Some of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX>'s fellow counterterrorism <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>, such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX>'s
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sheehan</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Watson</ENAMEX>, shared his disappointment that no military response
                occurred at the time. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> recently recalled that an angry <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sheehan</ENAMEX> asked
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rhetorically of Defense</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>:"Does <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> have to attack the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> to get
                their attention?"
            
            On the question of evidence, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tenet</ENAMEX> told us he was surprised to hear that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> was awaiting a conclusion from him on responsibility for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cole</ENAMEX> attack
                before taking action against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>. He did not recall <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX> or anyone else
                telling him that they were waiting for the magic words from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>. Nor
                did he remember having any discussions with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> about
                retaliation. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tenet</ENAMEX> told us he believed that it was up to him to present the case.
                Then it was up to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principals</ENAMEX> to decide if the case was good enough to justify
                using <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX>. He believed he laid out what was knowable relatively early in the
                investigation, and that this evidence never really changed until after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX>.
            
            A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> told us that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> chose the term "preliminary judgment"
                because of their notion of how an intelligence standard of proof differed from a
                legal standard. Because the attack was the subject of a criminal investigation, they
                told us, the term preliminary was used to avoid locking the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> in with
                statements that might later be obtained by defense <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> in a future court case.
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">At the time, Clarke</ENAMEX> was aware of the problem of distinguishing between an
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intelligence</ENAMEX> case and a law enforcement case. Asking <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> law enforcement officials
                to concur with an intelligence-based case before their investigation had been
                concluded "could give rise to charges that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> had acted before final
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">culpability</ENAMEX> had been determined."
            
            There was no interagency consideration of just what military action might have looked
                like in practice-either the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX>'s new "phased campaign" concept or a prolonged
                air campaign in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>, such as Under <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Slocombe</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Vice Admiral Fry</ENAMEX>, told us the military response options were still
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">limited</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> continued to be elusive. They felt, just as they had for the past
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</TIMEX>, that hitting inexpensive and rudimentary training <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camps</ENAMEX> with costly
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missiles</ENAMEX> would not do much good and might even help <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> if the strikes failed
                to kill <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>.
            
            In late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> began thinking about the counterterrorism
                policy agenda they would present to the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>. The Counterterrorist
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center</ENAMEX> put down its best ideas for the future, assuming it was free of any prior
                policy or financial constraints. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> was therefore infor mally referred to as
                the "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Blue Sky</ENAMEX>" memo; it was sent to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 29</TIMEX>. The memo proposed 
            
                A major effort to support the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern Alliance</ENAMEX> through intelligence sharing
                    and increased funding so that it could stave off the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Taliban</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX> and tie down
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fighters</ENAMEX>. This effort was not intended to remove theTaliban from power,
                    a goal that was judged impractical and too expensive for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> alone to
                    attain.
                Increased support to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Uzbeks</ENAMEX> to strengthen their ability to fight terrorism
                    and assist the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> in doing so.
                Assistance to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-Taliban</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> and proxies who might be encouraged to
                    passively resist the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX>.
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> memo noted that there was "no single <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">'silver bullet</ENAMEX>' available to deal with
                the growing problems in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>." A multifaceted strategy would be needed to
                produce change.
            
            No action was taken on these ideas in the few remaining <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinton</ENAMEX>
                administration. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX> did not recall seeing or being briefed on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blue Sky</ENAMEX> memo.
                Nor was the memo discussed during the transition with incoming top <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>
                administration <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tenet</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">deputy</ENAMEX> told us they pressed these ideas as
                options after the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> took office.
            
            As the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> drew to a close, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> developed a
                policy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> of their own, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> such comprehensive effort since the Delenda
                plan of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>. The resulting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>, entitled "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Strategy for Eliminating the Threat</ENAMEX>
                from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jihadist Networks</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qida</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Status and Prospects</ENAMEX>," reviewed the threat
                and the record to date, incorporated the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>'s new ideas from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blue Sky</ENAMEX> memo, and
                posed several near-term policy options. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> proposed a goal to
                "roll back" <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a period of three to five years</TIMEX>. Over time, the policy
                should try to weaken and eliminate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX>'s infrastructure in order to reduce
                it to a "rump <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>" like other formerly feared but now largely defunct terrorist
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1980s</TIMEX>. "Continued <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-al Qida</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> at the current level
                will prevent some attacks," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> wrote,"but will not seriously attrit
                their ability to plan and conduct attacks." The paper backed covert aid to the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern Alliance</ENAMEX>, covert aid to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Uzbekistan</ENAMEX>, and renewed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Predator</ENAMEX> flights in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX>
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>. A sentence called for military action to destroy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> command-andcontrol
                targets and infrastructure andTaliban military and command assets. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> also
                expressed concern about the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX>.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHANGE AND CONTINUITY</ENAMEX>
            On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November 7, 2000</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">voters</ENAMEX> went to the polls in what turned out to be one
                of the closest presidential contests in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> history-an election campaign during
                which there was a notable absence of serious discussion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> threat or
                terrorism. Election <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> became a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36-day</TIMEX> legal fight. Until the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5-4</ENAMEX>
                ruling on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 12</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Gore</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concession</ENAMEX>, no one knew whether
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> or his <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republican</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponent</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Governor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George W. Bush</ENAMEX>, would become
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>.
            The dispute over the election and the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36-day</TIMEX> delay cut in half the normal transition
                period. Given that a presidential election in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> brings wholesale
                change in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX>, this loss of time hampered the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> in
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">identifying</ENAMEX>, recruiting, clearing, and obtaining <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> confirmation of key
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">appointees</ENAMEX>.
            From the Old to the New
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principal</ENAMEX> figures on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> would be <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Security Advisor</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Condoleezza Rice</ENAMEX>, who had been a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> of
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George H.W. Bush</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rice</ENAMEX>'s deputy, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Hadley</ENAMEX>, who had been an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assistant secretary</ENAMEX>
                of defense under the first <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>; and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chief of Staff</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrew Card</ENAMEX>, who had served that
                same <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> as deputy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief of staff</ENAMEX>, then <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX> of transportation. For
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary of state</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> chose <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Colin Powell</ENAMEX>, who had been national security
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">advisor</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald Reagan</ENAMEX> and then <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joint Chiefs of Staff</ENAMEX>.
                For <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX> of defense he selected <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Rumsfeld</ENAMEX>, a former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>,
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief of staff</ENAMEX>, and, under <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gerald Ford</ENAMEX>, already once secretary
                of defense. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> decided fairly soon to keep <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tenet</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelligence</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis Freeh</ENAMEX>, who had statutory <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten-year</TIMEX> tenure, would remain director
                of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> until his voluntary retirement in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer of 2001</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> and his
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principal advisers</ENAMEX> had all received briefings on terrorism, including <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>. In
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early September 2000</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Acting Deputy Director</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central Intelligence John McLaughlin</ENAMEX>
                led a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ranch</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Crawford</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX>, and gave him a wide-ranging,
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four-hour</TIMEX> review of sensitive information. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ben Bonk</ENAMEX>, deputy chief of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>'s
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Counterterrorist Center</ENAMEX>, used one of the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">four hours</TIMEX> to deal with terrorism. To
                highlight the danger of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX> obtaining <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemical</ENAMEX>, biological, radiological, or
                nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bonk</ENAMEX> brought along a mock-up suitcase to evoke the way the Aum
                Shinrikyo doomsday <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cult</ENAMEX> had spread deadly sarin nerve <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">subway</ENAMEX> in
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bonk</ENAMEX> told <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> would die from terrorism during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next four</TIMEX>
                    <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>.
            
            During the long contest after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">election day</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> set up an office in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Crawford</ENAMEX> to
                pass intelligence to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> and some of his key <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisers</ENAMEX>.
            
            Tenet, accompanied by his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">deputy director</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Pavitt</ENAMEX>, briefed
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">President-elect Bush</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blair House</ENAMEX> during the transition. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> told us he
                askedTenet whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> could kill <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>, andTenet replied that killing Bin
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ladin</ENAMEX> would have an effect but would not end the threat. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> told us
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tenet</ENAMEX> said to him that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> had all the authority it needed.
            
            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> met with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> for a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two-hour</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one-on-one</NUMEX> discussion of national
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">security</ENAMEX> and foreign policy challenges. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> recalled saying to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>, "I think
                you will find that by far your biggest threat is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>."
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> told us that he also said,"One of the great regrets of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">presidency</ENAMEX> is that
                I didn't get him [<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>] for you, because I tried to."
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> told the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> that he felt sure <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> had mentioned terrorism,
                but did not remember much being said about <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> recalled that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> had
                emphasized other issues such as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Korea</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli</ENAMEX>- <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Palestinian</ENAMEX> peace
                    process.
            
            In early <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke briefed Rice</ENAMEX> on terrorism. He gave similar
                presentations-describing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> as both an adaptable global <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> of jihadist
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX> and a lethal core terrorist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>-to <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Vice President-elect</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cheney, Hadley</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary of State-designate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Powell</ENAMEX>. One line in the briefing
                slides said that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> had sleeper cells in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 40</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>, including the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX>.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX> told us that he made a point of dropping in on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX>'s briefing of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rice</ENAMEX> to
                emphasize the importance of the issue. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Later the same day</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX> met with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rice</ENAMEX>. He
                says that he told her the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> would spend more time on terrorism in
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">general</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> in particular than on anything else. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rice</ENAMEX>'s recollection was
                that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX> told her she would be surprised at how much more time she was going to
                spend on terrorism than she expected, but that the bulk of their conversation dealt
                with the faltering <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Middle East</ENAMEX> peace process and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Korea</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> said that the
                new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX>, having been out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eight years</TIMEX>, had a steep learning curve
                to understand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> and the new transnational terrorist threat.
            
            Organizing a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Administration</ENAMEX>
            During the short transition, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rice and Hadley</ENAMEX> concentrated on staffing and organizing
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSC</ENAMEX>.
            
            Their policy priorities differed from those of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>. Those
                priorities included <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>, missile defense, the collapse of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Middle East</ENAMEX> peace
                process, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Persian Gulf</ENAMEX>.
            
            Generally aware that terrorism had changed since the first <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>, they
                paid particular attention to the question of how counterterrorism policy should be
                coordinated. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rice</ENAMEX> had asked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Virginia</ENAMEX> history <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philip Zelikow</ENAMEX>
                to advise her on the transition.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hadley</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zelikow</ENAMEX> asked <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">deputy</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger Cressey</ENAMEX>, for a special briefing
                on the terrorist threat and how <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clarke'sTransnationalThreats Directorate</ENAMEX> and
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Counterterrorism Security Group</ENAMEX> functioned.
            
            In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSC</ENAMEX> during the first <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>, many tough issues were addressed at
                the level of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deputies Committee</ENAMEX>. Issues did not go to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principals</ENAMEX> unless the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">deputies</ENAMEX> had been unable to resolve them. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Presidential Decision Directive</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">62</NUMEX> of the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> had said specifically that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Counterterrorism Security</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group</ENAMEX> should report through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deputies Committee</ENAMEX> or, at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Berger</ENAMEX>'s discretion,
                directly to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principals</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX> had in practice allowed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> to
                function as a parallel <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">deputies committee</ENAMEX>, reporting directly to those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Principals Committee</ENAMEX> who sat on the special <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Small Group</ENAMEX>. There, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> himself
                sat as a de facto <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principal</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rice</ENAMEX> decided to change the special structure that had
                been built to coordinate counterterrorism policy. It was important to sound
                policymaking, she felt, that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX>'s interagency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committee</ENAMEX>-like all others-report
                to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principals</ENAMEX> through the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">deputies</ENAMEX>.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rice</ENAMEX> made an initial decision to hold over both <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> and his entire
                counterterrorism <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>, a decision that she called rare for a new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>.
                She decided also that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> should retain the title of national counterterrorism
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">coordinator</ENAMEX>, although he would no longer be a de facto <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Principals</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Committee</ENAMEX> on his issues. The decision to keep <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rice</ENAMEX> said, was "not
                uncontroversial," since he was known as someone who "broke china," but she and
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hadley</ENAMEX> wanted an experienced crisis <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX>. No one else from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> had
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX>'s detailed knowledge of the levers of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">168</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> was disappointed
                at what he perceived as a demotion. He also worried that reporting through the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deputies Committee</ENAMEX> would slow decisionmaking on counterterrorism.
            
            The result, amid all the changes accompanying the transition, was significant
                continuity in counterterrorism policy. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Counterterrorism Security</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group</ENAMEX> would continue to manage coordination. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tenet</ENAMEX> remained <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelligence</ENAMEX> and kept the same chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subordinates</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Black</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> at
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Counterterrorist Center</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shelton</ENAMEX> remained <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joint Chiefs</ENAMEX>, with the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joint</ENAMEX> Staff largely the same. At the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Freeh</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Assistant Director</ENAMEX> for
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Counterterrorism Dale Watson</ENAMEX> remained. Working-level counterterrorism <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> at
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> stayed on, as is typically the case. The
                changes were at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cabinet</ENAMEX> and subcabinet level and in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSG</ENAMEX>'s reporting
                arrangements. At the subcabinet level, there were significant delays in the
                confirmation of key <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>, particularly at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense Department</ENAMEX>.
            The procedures of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> were to be at once more formal and less
                formal than its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">predecessor</ENAMEX>'s. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>, a voracious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reader</ENAMEX>, received his
                daily intelligence briefings in writing. He often scrawled questions and comments in
                the margins, eliciting written responses. The new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>, by contrast, reinstated
                the practice of face-to-face briefings from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DCI</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tenet</ENAMEX> met in
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oval Office</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:00 A.M.</TIMEX>, with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheney</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rice</ENAMEX>, and Card usually
                also present. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DCI</ENAMEX> both told us that these <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> sessions
                provided a useful opportunity for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchanges</ENAMEX> on intelligence issues.
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> talked with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rice</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</TIMEX>, and she in turn talked by phone at least
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Powell</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX>. As a result, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> often felt less need for
                formal meetings. If, however, he decided that an event or an issue called for
                action, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rice</ENAMEX> would typically call on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hadley</ENAMEX> to have the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deputies Committee</ENAMEX> develop
                and review options. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> said that this process often tried his patience
                but that he understood the necessity for coordination.
            
            Early Decisions
            Within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first few days</TIMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>'s inauguration, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> approached <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rice</ENAMEX> in an
                effort to get her-and the new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX>-to give terrorism very high priority and to
                act on the agenda that he had pushed during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last few months</TIMEX> of the previous
                administration. After <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rice</ENAMEX> requested that all senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> identify desirable major
                policy reviews or initiatives, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> submitted an elaborate memorandum on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January</TIMEX>
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25, 2001</TIMEX>. He attached to it his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX> Delenda Plan and the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 2000</TIMEX> strategy
                paper." We urgently need . . . a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Principals</ENAMEX> level review on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qida</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX>,"
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> wrote.
            
            He wanted the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Principals Committee</ENAMEX> to decide whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> was "a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> order
                threat" or a more modest worry being overblown by "chicken little" alarmists.
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alluding</ENAMEX> to the transition briefing that he had prepared for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rice</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> wrote that
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> "is not some narrow, little terrorist issue that needs to be included in
                broader regional policy." <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> key decisions that had been deferred, he noted,
                concerned covert aid to keep the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern Alliance</ENAMEX> alive when fighting began again
                in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the spring</TIMEX>, and covert aid to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Uzbeks</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> also suggested
                that decisions should be made soon on messages to theTaliban and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> over the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">sanctuary</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>, on possible new money for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX>, and on
                "when and how . . . to respond to the attack on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">USS Cole</ENAMEX>."
            
            The national security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisor</ENAMEX> did not respond directly to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX>'s memorandum. No
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Principals Committee</ENAMEX> meeting on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> was held until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 4, 2001</TIMEX> (although
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Principals Committee</ENAMEX> met frequently on other subjects, such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Middle East</ENAMEX>
                peace process, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Persian Gulf</ENAMEX> )<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.174</NUMEX> But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rice</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hadley</ENAMEX> began to
                address the issues <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> had listed. What to do or say about the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cole</ENAMEX> had been an
                obvious question since inauguration <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX>. When the attack occurred, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25 days</TIMEX> before
                the election, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> had said to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNN</ENAMEX>, "I hope that we can gather enough
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intelligence</ENAMEX> to figure out who did the act and take the necessary action. There must
                be a consequence." Since the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> had
                not responded militarily, what was the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> to do?
            On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 25</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tenet</ENAMEX> briefed the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cole</ENAMEX> investigation. The written
                briefing repeated for top <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> of the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> what the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> had told
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November</TIMEX>. This included the "preliminary judgment" that
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> was responsible, with the caveat that no evidence had yet been found that
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> himself ordered the attack. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tenet</ENAMEX> told us he had no recollection of a
                conversation with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> about this briefing.
            
            In his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 25</TIMEX> memo, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> had advised <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rice</ENAMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> should respond to
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cole</ENAMEX> attack, but "should take advantage of the policy that 'we will respond at a
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>, place and manner of our own choosing' and not be forced into knee-jerk
                    responses." Before <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheney</ENAMEX> visited the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> in mid-February, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> sent him a memo-outside the usual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>
                document-management system-suggesting that he ask <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> "what additional
                information is needed before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> can definitively conclude that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al-Qida</ENAMEX> was
                responsible" for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cole</ENAMEX>.
            
            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 2001</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>'s briefing slides for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rice</ENAMEX> were still describing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>'s
                "preliminary judgment" that a "strong circumstantial case" could be made against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al</ENAMEX>
                Qaeda but noting that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> continued to lack "conclusive information on external
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">command</ENAMEX> and control" of the attack.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aides</ENAMEX> continued to provide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rice</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hadley</ENAMEX> with evidence reinforcing
                the case against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> and urging action.
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> explained to us that he had been concerned lest an ineffectual air
                strike just serve to give <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> a propaganda advantage. He said he had not been
                told about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> warnings to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> told us
                that he had concluded that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> must use ground <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> for a job like
                    this.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rice</ENAMEX> told us that there was never a formal, recorded decision not to retaliate
                specifically for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cole</ENAMEX> attack. Exchanges with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX>, between the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tenet</ENAMEX>, and between herself and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Powell</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> had produced a
                consensus that "tit-for-tat" responses were likely to be counterproductive. This had
                been the case, she thought, with the cruise <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missile</ENAMEX> strikes of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 1998</TIMEX>. The new
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">team</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> did not push for action. On the contrary, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> thought that
                too much time had passed and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">deputy</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Wolfowitz</ENAMEX>, thought that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cole</ENAMEX>
                attack was "stale." <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hadley</ENAMEX> said that in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>'s real response
                to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cole</ENAMEX> would be a new, more aggressive strategy against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>.
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> decided to propose to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> a substantial increase in
                counterterrorism funding for national security <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>, including the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> and the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>. This included a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">27 percent</NUMEX> increase in counterterrorism funding for the
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>.
            
            Starting a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Review</ENAMEX>
            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early March</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> postponed action on proposals for increasing aid
                to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern Alliance</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Uzbeks</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rice</ENAMEX> noted at the time that a more
                wide-ranging examination of policy toward <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> was needed <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>. She wanted
                the review very soon.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rice</ENAMEX> and others recalled the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> saying, "I'm tired of swatting at flies." The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> reportedly also said,"I'm tired of playing
                defense. I want to play offense. I want to take the fight to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX>." <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> explained to us that he had become
                impatient. He apparently had heard proposals for rolling back <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> but felt that
                catching <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX> one by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or even cell by cell was not an approach likely to
                succeed in the long run. At the same time, he said, he understood that policy had to
                be developed slowly so that diplomacy and financial and military measures could mesh
                with one another.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hadley</ENAMEX> convened an informal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deputies Committee</ENAMEX> meeting on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 7</TIMEX>, when some of the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">deputies</ENAMEX> had not yet been confirmed. For the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX>'s various
                proposals-for aid to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern Alliance</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Uzbeks</ENAMEX> and for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Predator</ENAMEX>
                missions-went before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> that, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSC</ENAMEX>, would do most of the policy
                work. Though they made no decisions on these specific proposals, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hadley</ENAMEX> apparently
                concluded that there should be a presidential national security policy directive
                (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSPD</ENAMEX>) on terrorism.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> would later express irritation about the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">deputies</ENAMEX>' insistence that a strategy
                for coping with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> be framed within the context of a regional policy. He
                doubted that the benefits would compensate for the time lost. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> had
                in fact proceeded with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Principals Committee</ENAMEX> meetings on topics including <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> and
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sudan</ENAMEX> without prior contextual review, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> favored moving ahead similarly
                with a narrow counterterrorism agenda.
            
            But the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX>'s senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisers</ENAMEX> saw the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> problem as part of a puzzle that
                could not be assembled without filling in the pieces for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>.
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rice</ENAMEX> deferred a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Principals Committee</ENAMEX> meeting on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> until the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">deputies</ENAMEX> had
                developed a new policy for their consideration.
            The full <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deputies Committee</ENAMEX> discussed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 30</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> briefing slides
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">described al Qaeda</ENAMEX> as the "most dangerous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> we face," citing its "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX>,
                experience, resources, safe haven in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>, [and] focus on attacking <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>" The
                slides warned,"There will be more attacks."
            
            At the meeting, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">deputies</ENAMEX> endorsed covert aid to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Uzbekistan</ENAMEX>. Regarding the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern Alliance</ENAMEX>, they "agreed to make no major commitment at this time."
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> would first consider options for aiding other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti- Taliban</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>.
            
            Meanwhile, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> would "initiate a comprehensive review of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> policy
                on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>" and explore policy options on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>, "including the option of
                supporting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX> change."
            
            Working-level <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> were also to consider new steps on terrorist financing and
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>'s perennially troubled public diplomacy efforts in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX> world, where
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> warned that "we have by and large ceded the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> of public opinion" to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qaeda</ENAMEX>.
            While <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> remained concerned about the pace of the policy review, he now saw a
                greater possibility of persuading the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">deputies</ENAMEX> to recognize the changed nature of
                    terrorism.
            
            The process of fleshing out that strategy was under way.
            THE <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEW ADMINISTRATION</ENAMEX>'S APPROACH
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">its first months</TIMEX> faced many problems other than terrorism.
                They included the collapse of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Middle East</ENAMEX> peace process and, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX>, a crisis
                over a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>" <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">spy</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX>" brought down in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> territory. The new administration
                also focused heavily on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX>, a new nuclear strategy that allowed missile
                defenses, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Persian Gulf</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the spring</TIMEX>, reporting on
                terrorism surged dramatically. In <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">chapter 8</ENAMEX>, we will explore this reporting and the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ways</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> responded. These increasingly alarming reports, briefed to the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> and top <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>, became part of the context in which the new
                administration weighed its options for policy on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>.
            Except for a few reports that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSG</ENAMEX> considered and apparently judged to be
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">unreliable</ENAMEX>, none of these pointed specifically to possible <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> action inside
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>-although the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSG</ENAMEX> continued to be concerned about the domestic
                threat. The mosaic of threat intelligence came from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Counterterrorist Center</ENAMEX>,
                which collected only abroad. Its reports were not supplemented by reports from the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> had expressed concern about an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> presence in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>,
                and he worried about an attack on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> by "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hizbollah</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hamas</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qida</ENAMEX> and
                other terrorist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>."
            
            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> announced that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheney</ENAMEX> would himself lead an
                effort looking at preparations for managing a possible attack by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX> of mass
                destruction and at more general problems of national preparedness. The next few
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> were mainly spent organizing the effort and bringing an admiral from the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Sixth Fleet</ENAMEX> back to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> to manage it. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">task force</ENAMEX> was
                just getting under way when the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX> attack occurred.
            
            On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 29</TIMEX>, at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tenet</ENAMEX>'s request, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rice</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tenet</ENAMEX> converted their usual <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekly</TIMEX> meeting
                into a broader discussion on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> included <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CTC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cofer</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Black</ENAMEX>, and "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard</ENAMEX>," a group chief with authority over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rice</ENAMEX>
                asked about "taking the offensive" and whether any approach could be made to
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">influence Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Black</ENAMEX> replied that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>'s ongoing
                disruption activities were "taking the offensive" and that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> could not be
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">deterred</ENAMEX>. A wide-ranging discussion then ensued about "breaking the back" of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bin</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ladin</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tenet</ENAMEX> emphasized the ambitious plans for covert action that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> had developed in
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 2000</TIMEX>. In discussing the draft <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> for this program in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> had pointed out that the spending level envisioned for these plans was
                larger than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>'s entire current budget for counterterrorism covert action. It
                would be a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">multiyear</TIMEX> program, requiring such levels of spending for <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about five</NUMEX>
                    <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>.
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX>, "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard</ENAMEX>," told us that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rice</ENAMEX> "got it." He said she agreed with his
                conclusions about what needed to be done, although he complained to us that the
                policy process did not follow through quickly enough.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Black</ENAMEX> were asked to develop a range of options for attacking <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>'s
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX>, from the least to most ambitious.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rice</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hadley</ENAMEX> asked <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> to draw up the new presidential directive.
                On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 7</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hadley</ENAMEX> circulated the first draft, describing it as "an admittedly
                ambitious" program for confronting <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>.
            
            The draft <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSPD</ENAMEX>'s goal was to "eliminate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qida</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> of terrorist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> as a
                threat to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> and to friendly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX>." It called for a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">multiyear</TIMEX>
                effort involving diplomacy, covert action, economic measures, law enforcement,
                public diplomacy, and if necessary military efforts. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX> was to
                work with other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> to end all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> sanctuaries, and also to work with
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury Department</ENAMEX> to disrupt terrorist financing. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> was to develop an
                expanded covert action program including significant additional funding and aid to
                anti-Taliban <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. The draft also tasked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX> with ensuring that sufficient funds
                to support this program were found in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> budgets from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal years 2002</TIMEX> to
                    <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2006</TIMEX>.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rice</ENAMEX> viewed this draft directive as the embodiment of a comprehensive new strategy
                employing all instruments of national power to eliminate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> threat.
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX>, however, regarded the new draft as essentially similar to the proposal he
                had developed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 2000</TIMEX> and put forward to the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January</TIMEX>
                2001.202 In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> asked to be moved from his counterterrorism
                portfolio to a new set of responsibilities for cybersecurity. He told us that he was
                frustrated with his role and with an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> that he considered not "serious
                about <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>." If <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> was frustrated, he never
                expressed it to her, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rice</ENAMEX> told us.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Diplomacy in Blind Alleys</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>.
            
            The new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> had already begun exploring possible diplomatic options,
                retracing many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">paths</ENAMEX> traveled by its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">predecessors</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">envoys</ENAMEX> again pressed
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX> to turn <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> "over to a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> where he could face justice" and
                repeated, yet again, the warning that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX> would be held responsible for any
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> attacks on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> interests.
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> repeated their old arguments. Deputy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary of State</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Armitage</ENAMEX> told us that while <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diplomats</ENAMEX> were becoming more active on
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the spring</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer of 2001</TIMEX>, "it would be wrong for anyone to
                characterize this as a dramatic shift from the previous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>."
            
            In <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">deputies</ENAMEX> meetings at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of June</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tenet</ENAMEX> was tasked to assess the prospects
                forTaliban cooperation with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> was tasked
                to flesh out options for dealing with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX>. Revisiting these issues tried the
                patience of some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> who felt they had already been down these roads
                and who found the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSC</ENAMEX>'s procedures slow." We weren't going fast enough,"Armitage
                told us. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> kept arguing that moves against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> should not
                have to wait <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> for a larger review of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> policy in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Asia</ENAMEX>." For the
                government," <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hadley</ENAMEX> said to us,"we moved it along as fast as we could move it
                    along."
            
            As all hope in moving the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX> faded, debate revived about giving covert
                assistance to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponents</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cofer Black</ENAMEX> renewed the
                push to aid the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern Alliance</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> suggested starting with modest aid, just
                enough to keep the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern Alliance</ENAMEX> in the fight and tie down <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX>,
                without aiming to overthrow the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX>.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rice</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hadley</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSC</ENAMEX> staff <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zalmay Khalilzad</ENAMEX>, told us
                they opposed giving aid to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern Alliance</ENAMEX> alone. They argued that the program
                needed to have a big part for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pashtun</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponents</ENAMEX> of theTaliban. They also thought the
                program should be conducted on a larger scale than had been suggested. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Clarke</ENAMEX>
                concurred with the idea of a larger program, but he warned that delay risked the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern Alliance</ENAMEX>'s final defeat at the hands of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX>.
            
            During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the spring</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>, at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSC</ENAMEX>'s request, had developed draft legal
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX>-a presidential finding-to undertake a large-scale program of covert
                assistance to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foes</ENAMEX>. The draft <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> expressly stated that the
                goal of the assistance was not to overthrow the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX>. But even this program would
                be very costly. This was the context for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> conversations, when in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX> Tenet
                stressed the need to consider the impact of such a large program on the political
                situation in the region and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tenet</ENAMEX> talked to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rice</ENAMEX> about the need for a
                multiyear financial commitment.
            
            By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">deputies</ENAMEX> were moving toward agreement that some last effort should be
                made to convince theTaliban to shift position and then, if that failed, the
                administration would move on the significantly enlarged covert action program. As
                the draft presidential directive was circulated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX> sent
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">deputies</ENAMEX> a lengthy historical review of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> efforts to engage the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX> about
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> on." These talks have been fruitless," the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX>
                    concluded.
            
            Arguments in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX> brought to the surface the more fundamental issue of whether
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> covert action program should seek to overthrow the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>, intervening
                decisively in the civil war in order to change <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>. By the end
                of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">deputies</ENAMEX> meeting on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 10</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> formally agreed on a three-phase
                strategy. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">envoy</ENAMEX> would give the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX> a last chance. If this failed,
                continuing diplomatic pressure would be combined with the planned covert action
                program encouraging anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Taliban Afghans</ENAMEX> of all major ethnic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> to stalemate the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX> in the civil war and attack <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> bases, while the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>
                developed an international <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">coalition</ENAMEX> to undermine the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>. In phase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>, if
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">theTaliban</ENAMEX>'s policy still did not change, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">deputies</ENAMEX> agreed that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>
                would try covert action to topple the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> from within.
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">deputies</ENAMEX> agreed to revise the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> presidential directive, then being
                finalized for presidential approval, in order to add this strategy to it. Armitage
                explained to us that after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> of continuing the previous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>'s
                policy, he and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Powell</ENAMEX> were bringing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX> to a policy of overthrowing
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX>. From his point of view, once the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> made the commitment to
                arm the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern Alliance</ENAMEX>, even covertly, it was taking action to initiate regime
                change, and it should give those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponents</ENAMEX> the strength to achieve complete
                    victory.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>.
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> immediately encountered the dilemmas that arose from the
                varied objectives the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> was trying to accom plish in its relationship
                with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February 2001</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> wrote <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Musharraf</ENAMEX> on a number
                of matters. He emphasized that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> were "a direct threat to the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX> and its interests that must be addressed." He urged <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Musharraf</ENAMEX> to use
                his influence with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Powell</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Armitage</ENAMEX> reviewed the possibility of acquiring more carrots to dangle in
                front of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>. Given the generally negative view of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Capitol Hill</ENAMEX>,
                the idea of lifting sanctions may have seemed far-fetched, but perhaps no more so
                than the idea of persuading <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Musharraf</ENAMEX> to antagonize the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Islamists</ENAMEX> in his own
                government and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>.
            
            On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 18</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rice</ENAMEX> met with the visiting <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pakistani</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreign minister</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abdul Sattar</ENAMEX>. She
                "really let him have it" about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>, she told us.
            
            Other evidence corroborates her account. But, as she was upbraiding <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sattar</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rice</ENAMEX>
                recalled thinking that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pakistani</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diplomat</ENAMEX> seemed to have heard it all before.
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sattar</ENAMEX> urged senior <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> policymakers to engage the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX>, arguing that such a
                course would take time but would produce results. In late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">deputies</ENAMEX> agreed
                to review <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> objectives. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> urged <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hadley</ENAMEX> to split off all other issues in
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pakistani</ENAMEX> relations and just focus on demanding that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> move vigorously
                against terrorism-to push the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pakistanis</ENAMEX> to do before an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> attack what
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> would demand that they do after. He had made similar requests in the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>; he had no more success with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rice</ENAMEX> than he had with
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX>.
            
            On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 4</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> wrote <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Musharraf</ENAMEX> to request his support in
                dealing with terrorism and to urge <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> to engage actively against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>. The
                new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> was again registering its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concerns</ENAMEX>, just as its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">predecessor</ENAMEX> had,
                but it was still searching for new incentives to open up diplomatic possibilities.
                For its part, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> had done little. Assistant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary of State</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christina Rocca</ENAMEX>
                described the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>'s plan to break this logjam as a move from "half
                engagement" to "enhanced engagement." The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> was not ready to confront
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Islamabad</ENAMEX> and threaten to rupture relations. Deputy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Armitage</ENAMEX> told us that
                before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9/11</TIMEX>, the envisioned new approach to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> had not yet been
                    attempted.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX>.
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> did not develop new diplomatic initiatives on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> with
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Saudi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9/11</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheney</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Crown</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prince</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abdullah</ENAMEX>
                on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 5, 2001</TIMEX>, to seek <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Saudi</ENAMEX> help in preventing threatened attacks on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">facilities</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kingdom</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary of State</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Powell</ENAMEX> met with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crown prince</ENAMEX> twice
                before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9/11</TIMEX>. They discussed topics like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX>, not <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Saudi</ENAMEX> relations in
                the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer of 2001</TIMEX> were marked by sometimes heated disagreements about ongoing
                <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli</ENAMEX>- <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Palestinian</ENAMEX> violence, not about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>.
            
            Military Plans
            The confirmation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX>'s new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> was a lengthy process. Deputy
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolfowitz</ENAMEX> was confirmed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 2001</TIMEX> and Under <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense</ENAMEX> for
                Policy <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Douglas Feith</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July</TIMEX>. Though the new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> were briefed about terrorism
                and some of the earlier planning, including that for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Operation Infinite Resolve</ENAMEX>,
                they were focused, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> told us, on creating a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twenty-first-century</TIMEX>
                    military.
            
            At the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joint Chiefs of Staff</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Shelton</ENAMEX> did not recall much interest by the new
                administration in military options against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>. He could not
                recall any specific guidance on the topic from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brian Sheridan</ENAMEX>-the
                outgoing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assistant secretary</ENAMEX> of defense for special <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> and low-intensity
                conflict (SOLIC), the key counterterrorism policy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX>-never
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">briefed Rumsfeld</ENAMEX>. He departed on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 20</TIMEX>; he had not been replaced by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX>.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> noted to us his own interest in terrorism, which came up often in his
                regular meetings with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tenet</ENAMEX>. He thought that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense Department</ENAMEX>, before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9/11</TIMEX>,
                was not organized adequately or prepared to deal with new threats like terrorism.
                But his time was consumed with getting new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> in place and working on the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">foundation</ENAMEX> documents of a new defense policy, the quadrennial defense review, the
                defense planning guidance, and the existing contingency plans. He did not recall any
                particular counterterrorism issue that engaged his attention before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9/11</TIMEX>, other than
                the development of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Predator</ENAMEX> unmanned <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft system</ENAMEX>.
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commander</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central Command</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Franks</ENAMEX>, told us that he did not regard the
                existing plans as serious. To him a real military plan to address <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> would
                need to go all the way, following through the details of a full campaign (including
                the political-military issues of where operations would be based) and securing the
                rights to fly over neighboring <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>.
            
            The draft presidential directive circulated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 2001</TIMEX> began its discussion of the
                military by reiterating the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense Department</ENAMEX>'s lead role in protecting its forces
                abroad. The draft included a section directing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> to "develop
                contingency plans" to attack both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX> targets in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>. The
                new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">section</ENAMEX> did not specifically order planning for the use of ground <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX>, or
                clarify how this guidance differed from the existing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Infinite Resolve</ENAMEX> plans.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hadley</ENAMEX> told us that by circulating this section, a draft <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Annex B</ENAMEX> to the directive,
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> was putting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> on notice that it would need to produce new
                military plans to address this problem<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.225</NUMEX> "The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">military</ENAMEX> didn't particularly want
                this mission," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rice</ENAMEX> told us.
            
            With this directive still awaiting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>'s signature, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> did
                not order his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subordinates</ENAMEX> to begin preparing any new military plans against either
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX> before 9/11.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> told us that before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9/11</TIMEX>, he had not seen good options for special
                military <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>. Suitable bases in neighboring <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> were
                not available and, even if the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> were sent in, it was not clear where they
                would go to find <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> told us that before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9/11</TIMEX> there was an appetite in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> for
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">killing Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>, not for war. Looking back in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX>, he equated the presidential
                directive with a readiness to invade <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>. The problem, he said, would have
                been how to do that if there had not been another attack on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>. To many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>,
                he said, it would have seemed like an ultimate act of unilateralism. But he said
                that he was prepared to take that on.
            
            Domestic Change and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Continuity</ENAMEX>
            During the transition, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> had chosen <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Ashcroft</ENAMEX>, a former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senator</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Missouri</ENAMEX>,
                as his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney general</ENAMEX>. On his arrival at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ashcroft</ENAMEX> told us,
                he faced a number of problems spotlighting the need for reform at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>.
            
            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> briefed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Attorney General</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ashcroft</ENAMEX> on his directorate's issues. He
                reported that at the time, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney general</ENAMEX> acknowledged a "steep learning
                curve," and asked about the progress of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cole</ENAMEX> investigation.
            
            Neither <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ashcroft</ENAMEX> nor his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">predecessors</ENAMEX> received the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">President's Daily</ENAMEX> Brief. His
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> did receive the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> intelligence report for senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> that, during
                the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">spring</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer of 2001</TIMEX>, was carrying much of the same threat information.
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> was struggling to build up its institutional capabilities to do more against
                terrorism, relying on a strategy called <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">MAXCAP 05</ENAMEX> that had been unveiled in the
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer of 2000</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assistant director</ENAMEX> for counterterrorism, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dale Watson</ENAMEX>, told
                us that he felt the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> was not supportive of the
                strategy. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Watson</ENAMEX> had the sense that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX> wanted the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> to get
                back to the investigative basics: <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>, and civil rights. The new
                administration did seek an <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8 percent</NUMEX> increase in overall <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> funding in its initial
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">budget</ENAMEX> proposal for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 2002</TIMEX>, including the largest proposed percentage
                increase in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>'s counterterrorism program since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 1997</TIMEX>. The
                additional funds included the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>'s support of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Winter Olympics</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Salt Lake</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">City</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Utah</ENAMEX> (a onetime increase), enhanced security at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX>, and
                improvements to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WMD</ENAMEX> incident response capability.
            
            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX> began shaping plans for building a budget for fiscal
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year 2003</TIMEX>, the process that would usually culminate in an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> proposal at
                the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">beginning of 2002</TIMEX>. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 9</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney general</ENAMEX> testified at a congressional
                hearing concerning federal efforts to combat terrorism. He said that "one of the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nation</ENAMEX>'s most fundamental responsibilities is to protect its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> . . . from
                terrorist attacks." The budget guidance issued <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next day</TIMEX>, however, highlighted
                gun crimes, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">narcotics</ENAMEX> trafficking, and civil rights as priorities. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Watson</ENAMEX> told us
                that he almost fell out of his chair when he saw this memo, because it did not
                mention counterterrorism. Longtime <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis Freeh</ENAMEX> left in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 2001</TIMEX>, after
                announcing the indictment in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Khobar Towers</ENAMEX> case that he had worked so long to
                obtain. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Pickard</ENAMEX> was the acting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Freeh</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">successor</ENAMEX>,
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Mueller</ENAMEX>, took office just before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9/11</TIMEX>. The
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX> prepared a draft <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 2003</TIMEX> budget that maintained but did
                not increase the funding level for counterterrorism in its pending <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 2002</TIMEX>
                proposal. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pickard</ENAMEX> appealed for more counterterrorism enhancements, an appeal the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney general</ENAMEX> denied on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 10</TIMEX>.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ashcroft</ENAMEX> had also inherited an ongoing debate on whether and how to modify the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>
                procedures governing intelligence sharing between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Department</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Criminal Division</ENAMEX>. But in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 2001</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ashcroft</ENAMEX>'s deputy, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thompson</ENAMEX>, issued a memorandum reaffirming the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX> procedures with the clarification
                that evidence of "any federal felony" was to be immediately reported by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> to
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Criminal Division</ENAMEX>. The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX> procedures remained in effect until after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX>.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Covert Action</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Predator</ENAMEX>
            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 2001</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rice</ENAMEX> asked the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> to prepare a new series of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> for covert
                action in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rice</ENAMEX>'s recollection was that the idea had come from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX>
                and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSC</ENAMEX> senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> for intelligence, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary McCarthy</ENAMEX>, and had been linked to
                the proposal for aid to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern Alliance</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Uzbeks</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rice</ENAMEX> described the
                draft document as providing for "consolidation plus," superseding the various
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> documents. In fact, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> drafted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> documents. One was a
                finding that did <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> aid to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponents</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taliban</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>; the other was a
                <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">draft Memorandum of Notification</ENAMEX>, which included more open-ended language
                authorizing possible lethal action in a variety of situations. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tenet</ENAMEX> delivered both
                to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hadley</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 28</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>'s notes for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tenet</ENAMEX> advised him that "in response to
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSC</ENAMEX> request for drafts that will help the policymakers review their options,
                each of the documents has been crafted to provide the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Agency</ENAMEX> with the broadest
                possible discretion permissible under the law." At the meeting, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tenet</ENAMEX> argued for
                deciding on a policy before deciding on the legal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> to implement it.
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hadley</ENAMEX> accepted this argument, and the draft <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MON</ENAMEX> was put on hold.
            
            As the policy review moved forward, the planned covert action program for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>
                was included in the draft presidential directive, as part of an "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Annex A</ENAMEX>" on
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intelligence</ENAMEX> activities to "eliminate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> threat."
            
            The main debate during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer of 2001</TIMEX> concentrated on the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> new mechanism for a
                lethal attack on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Bin Ladin-an</ENAMEX> armed version of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Predator</ENAMEX> drone.
            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first months</TIMEX> of the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>, questions concerning the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Predator</ENAMEX>
                became more and more a central focus of dispute. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> favored resuming Predator
                flights over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> as soon as weather permitted, hoping that they still might
                provide the elusive "actionable intelligence" to target <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> with cruise
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missiles</ENAMEX>. Learning that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX> was thinking of equipping <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Predators</ENAMEX> with
                warheads, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> became even more enthusiastic about redeployment.
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CTC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cofer Black</ENAMEX>, argued against deploying the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Predator</ENAMEX> for reconnaissance
                purposes. He recalled that theTaliban had spotted a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Predator</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fall of 2000</TIMEX> and
                scrambled their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MiG</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">fighters</ENAMEX>. Black wanted to wait until the armed version was
                ready. "I do not believe the possible recon value outweighs the risk of possible
                program termination when the stakes are raised by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX> parading a charred
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Predator</ENAMEX> in front of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNN</ENAMEX>," he wrote. Military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joint Staff</ENAMEX> shared
                this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX>.
            
            There is some dispute as to whether or not the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deputies Committee</ENAMEX> endorsed resuming
                reconnaissance flights at its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 30, 2001</TIMEX>, meeting. In any event, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rice</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hadley</ENAMEX>
                ultimately went along with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX>, holding off on reconnaissance
                flights until the armed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Predator</ENAMEX> was ready.
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>'s senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> saw problems with the armed <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Predator</ENAMEX> as well, problems
                that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> and even Black and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allen</ENAMEX> were inclined to minimize. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> (which also
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">applied</ENAMEX> to reconnaissance flights) was money. A Predator cost <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $3 million</NUMEX>. If
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> flew Predators for its own reconnaissance or covert action purposes, it
                might be able to borrow them from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX>, but it was not clear that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Force</ENAMEX> would bear the cost if a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicle</ENAMEX> went down. Deputy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wolfowitz</ENAMEX> took the position that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> should have to pay for it; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>
                    disagreed.
            
            <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tenet</ENAMEX> in particular questioned whether he, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelligence</ENAMEX>, should operate an armed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Predator</ENAMEX>." This was new ground,"he told us.
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Tenet</ENAMEX> ticked off key questions: What is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">command</ENAMEX>? Who takes the shot?
                Are <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> comfortable with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> doing this, going outside of normal
                military <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">command</ENAMEX> and control? <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charlie Allen</ENAMEX> told us that when these questions were
                discussed at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>, he and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agency</ENAMEX>'s executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">A. B." Buzzy</ENAMEX>"
                Krongard, had said that either one of them would be happy to pull the trigger, but
                Tenet was appalled, telling them that they had no authority to do it, nor did
                    he.
            
            <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hellfire</ENAMEX> warhead carried by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Predator</ENAMEX> needed work. It had been built to
                hit tanks, not <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. It needed to be designed to explode in a different way, and
                even then had to be targeted with extreme precision. In the configuration planned by
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX> through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-2001</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Predator</ENAMEX>'s missile would not be able to hit a
                moving <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicle</ENAMEX>.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> had seen the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Predator</ENAMEX> video of the "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> in white." On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 11</TIMEX>,
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hadley</ENAMEX> tried to hurry along preparation of the armed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX>. He directed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McLaughlin</ENAMEX>,
                Wolfowitz, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joint Chiefs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice Chairman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Myers</ENAMEX> to deploy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Predators</ENAMEX> capable
                of being armed no later than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 1</TIMEX>. He also directed that they have
                cost-sharing arrangements in place by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 1</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rice</ENAMEX> told us that this attempt by
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hadley</ENAMEX> to dictate a solution had failed and that she eventually had to intervene
                    herself.
            
            On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 1</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deputies Committee</ENAMEX> met again to discuss the armed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Predator</ENAMEX>. They
                concluded that it was legal for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> to kill <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> or one of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">deputies</ENAMEX>
                with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Predator</ENAMEX>. Such strikes would be acts of self-defense that would not violate
                the ban on assassinations in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Executive Order 12333</ENAMEX>. The big issues-who would pay for
                what, who would authorize strikes, and who would pull the trigger-were left for the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principals</ENAMEX> to settle. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense Department</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> did not take positions
                on these issues.
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McLaughlin</ENAMEX> had also been reticent. When <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hadley</ENAMEX> circulated a memorandum
                attempting to prod the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">deputies</ENAMEX> to reach agreement, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McLaughlin</ENAMEX> sent it back with a
                handwritten comment on the cost-sharing:"we question whether it is advisable to make
                such an investment before the decision is taken on flying an armed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Predator</ENAMEX>." For
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX>, this came close to being a final straw. He angrily asked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rice</ENAMEX> to callTenet."
                Either <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qida</ENAMEX> is a threat worth acting against or it is not," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> wrote." <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>
                leadership has to decide which it is and cease these bi-polar mood swings."
            
            These debates, though, had little impact in advancing or delaying efforts to make the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Predator</ENAMEX> ready for combat. Those were in the hands of military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> and
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineers</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Jumper</ENAMEX> had commanded <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> air <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> and seen
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Predators</ENAMEX> used for reconnaissance in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Balkans</ENAMEX>. He started the program to develop
                an armed version and, after returning in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> to head the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Combat Command</ENAMEX>, took
                direct charge of it.
            There were numerous technical problems, especially with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hellfire</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missiles</ENAMEX>. The
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX> tests conducted during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the spring</TIMEX> were inadequate, so missile testing
                needed to continue and modifications needed to be made during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX>. Even then,
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jumper</ENAMEX> told us, problems with the equipment persisted. Nevertheless, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX>
                was moving at an extraordinary pace." In the modern era, since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1980s</TIMEX>," <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Jumper</ENAMEX>
                said to us,"I would be shocked if you found anything that went faster than
                    this."
            
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 2001</TIMEX>
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Principals Committee</ENAMEX> had its <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> meeting on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 4</TIMEX>. On the day
                of the meeting, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> sent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rice</ENAMEX> an impassioned personal note. He criticized <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
                counterterrorism efforts past and present. The "real question" before the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principals</ENAMEX>, he wrote, was "are we serious about dealing with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qida</ENAMEX> threat? . .
                . Is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qida</ENAMEX> a big deal? . . . Decision <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">makers</ENAMEX> should imagine themselves on a future
                day when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSG</ENAMEX> has not succeeded in stopping <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qida</ENAMEX> attacks and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">hundreds of</NUMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> lay dead in several <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>, including the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX>," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> wrote. "What
                would those decision <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">makers</ENAMEX> wish that they had done <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX>? That <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">future day</TIMEX> could
                happen at any time."
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> then turned to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cole</ENAMEX>." The fact that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">USS Cole</ENAMEX> was attacked during the
                last <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Administration</ENAMEX> does not absolve us of responding for the attack," he wrote.
                "Many in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">al Qida</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX> may have drawn the wrong lesson from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cole</ENAMEX>: that
                they can kill <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> without there being a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> response, without there being a
                price. . . . One might have thought that with a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$250m</NUMEX> hole in a destroyer and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX>
                dead <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sailors</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> might have wanted to respond. Instead, they have often
                talked about the fact that there is 'nothing worth hitting in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>' and said
                'the cruise <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missiles</ENAMEX> cost more than the jungle <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">gyms</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mud huts</ENAMEX>' at terrorist
                camps." <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> could not understand "why we continue to allow the existence of large
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">scale al Qida</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX> where we know <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are being trained to kill <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>."
            
            Turning to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> warned that its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bureaucracy</ENAMEX>, which was "masterful at
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">passive</ENAMEX> aggressive behavior," would resist funding the new national security
                presidential directive, leaving it a "hollow shell of words without deeds." The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>
                would insist its other priorities were more important. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Invoking</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>'s own
                language, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> wrote,"You are left with a modest effort to swat flies, to try to
                prevent specific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qida</ENAMEX> attacks by using [intelligence] to detect them and friendly
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> and intelligence <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> to stop them. You are left waiting for
                the big attack, with lots of casualties, after which some major <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> retaliation will
                be in order[.]"
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rice</ENAMEX> told us she took <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX>'s memo as a warning not to get dragged down by
                bureaucratic inertia.
            
            While his arguments have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX>, we also take <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX>'s jeremiad as something more.
                After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nine years</TIMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than three years</TIMEX> as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>'s
                national <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coordinator</ENAMEX>, he had often failed to persuade these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> to adopt his
                views, or to persuade his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">superiors</ENAMEX> to set an agenda of the sort he wanted or that
                the whole <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> could support. Meanwhile, another counterterrorism <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">veteran</ENAMEX>,
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cofer Black</ENAMEX>, was preparing his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boss</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principals</ENAMEX> meeting. He advised <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tenet</ENAMEX>
                that the draft presidential directive envisioned an ambitious covert action program,
                but that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> for it had not yet been approved and the funding still had
                not been found. If the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> was reluctant to use the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Predator</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Black</ENAMEX> did not mention
                it. He wanted "a timely decision from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Principals</ENAMEX>," adding that the window for
                missions within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX> was a short one. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principals</ENAMEX> would have to decide whether
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rice</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tenet, Rumsfeld</ENAMEX>, or someone else would give the order to fire.
            
            At the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 4</TIMEX> meeting, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principals</ENAMEX> approved the draft presidential directive
                with little discussion.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rice</ENAMEX> told us that she had, at some point, told <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> that she and his other
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisers</ENAMEX> thought it would take <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three years or so</TIMEX> for their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> strategy to
                    work.
            
            They then discussed the armed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Predator</ENAMEX>.
            Hadley portrayed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Predator</ENAMEX> as a useful tool, although perhaps not for immediate
                use. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rice</ENAMEX>, who had been advised by her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> that the armed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Predator</ENAMEX> was not ready
                for deployment, commented about the potential for using the armed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Predator</ENAMEX> in the
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">spring of 2002</TIMEX>.
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX> supported the armed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Predator</ENAMEX>, although <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Powell</ENAMEX> was not
                convinced that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> was as easy to target as had been suggested. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul O'Neill</ENAMEX> was skittish, cautioning about the implications of trying to
                kill an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX>.
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense Department</ENAMEX> favored strong action. Deputy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolfowitz</ENAMEX> questioned
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>' ability to deliver <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> and bring him to justice. He favored
                going after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> as part of a larger air strike, similar to what had been done
                in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1986</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> strike against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Libya</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Myers</ENAMEX> emphasized the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Predator</ENAMEX>'s value
                for surveillance, perhaps enabling broader air strikes that would go beyond Bin
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ladin</ENAMEX> to attack <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>'s training infrastructure.
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principals</ENAMEX> also discussed which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense</ENAMEX>-should have the authority
                to fire a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missile</ENAMEX> from the armed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Predator</ENAMEX>.
            
            At the end, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rice</ENAMEX> summarized the meeting's conclusions. The armed Predator capability
                was needed but not ready. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Predator</ENAMEX> would be available for the military to
                consider along with its other options. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> should consider flying
                reconnaissance-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only</NUMEX> missions. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principals</ENAMEX>-including the previously reluctant
                Tenet-thought that such reconnaissance flights were a good idea, combined with other
                efforts to get actionable intelligence. Tenet deferred an answer on the additional
                reconnaissance flights, conferred with his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> after the meeting, and then
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">directed the CIA</ENAMEX> to press ahead with them.
            
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A few days later</TIMEX>, a final version of the draft presidential directive was circulated,
                incorporating <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> minor changes made by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principals</ENAMEX>.
            
            On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 9</TIMEX>, dramatic news arrived from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alliance</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ahmed Shah Massoud</ENAMEX>, had granted an interview in his bungalow near the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tajikistan</ENAMEX> border with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> whom the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern Alliance</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> had been told were
                <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalists</ENAMEX>. The supposed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> and cameraman-actually <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">assassins</ENAMEX>-then set off a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bomb</ENAMEX>, riddling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Massoud</ENAMEX>'s chest with shrapnel. He died
                <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> later.
            On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 10</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hadley</ENAMEX> gathered the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">deputies</ENAMEX> to finalize their threephase, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">multiyear</TIMEX>
                plan to pressure and perhaps ultimately topple <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">theTaliban leadership</ENAMEX>.
            
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">That same day</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hadley</ENAMEX> instructed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DCI Tenet</ENAMEX> to have the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> prepare new draft legal
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> for the "broad covert action program" envisioned by the draft
                presidential directive. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hadley</ENAMEX> also directedTenet to prepare a separate section
                "authorizing a broad range of other covert activities, including authority to
                capture or to use lethal force" against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> command-and-control elements. This
                <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section</ENAMEX> would supersede the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>-era documents. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hadley</ENAMEX> wanted the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> to
                be flexible and broad enough "to cover any additional UBL-related covert actions
                    contemplated."
            
            Funding still needed to be located. The military component remained unclear. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>
                remained uncooperative. The domestic policy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX> were largely uninvolved.
                But the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pieces</ENAMEX> were coming together for an integrated policy dealing with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>,
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>.
