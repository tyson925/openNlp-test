            FIRST ARRIVALS IN <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">CALIFORNIA</ENAMEX>
            In <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">chapter 5</ENAMEX> we described the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southeast Asia</ENAMEX> travels of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nawaf al Hazmi</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Khalid al</ENAMEX>
                Mihdhar, and others in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 2000</TIMEX> on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> part of the "<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX> operation." In
                that chapter we also described how <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mihdhar</ENAMEX> was spotted in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuala Lumpur</ENAMEX> early in
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 2000</TIMEX>, along with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">associates</ENAMEX> who were not identified, and then was lost to
                sight when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> passed through <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bangkok</ENAMEX>. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 15</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX> and Mihdhar
                arrived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>. They spent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about two weeks</TIMEX> there before moving on to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">San</ENAMEX>
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diego</ENAMEX>.
            
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Two Weeks</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>
            Why <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hazmi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mihdhar</ENAMEX> came to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, we do not know for certain. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Khalid</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sheikh</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mohammed</ENAMEX> (KSM), the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">organizer</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX> operation, explains that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> was
                a convenient point of entry from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX> and had the added benefit of being far away
                from the intended target area.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mihdhar</ENAMEX> were ill-prepared for a mission in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. Their only
                qualifications for this plot were their devotion to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Usama Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>, their veteran
                service, and their ability to get valid <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> visas. Neither had spent any
                substantial time in the West, and neither spoke much, if any, <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>.
            
            It would therefore be plausible that they or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> would have tried to identify, in
                advance, a friendly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contact</ENAMEX> for them in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. In detention, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> denies
                that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> had any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southern California</ENAMEX>. We do not credit this
                denial<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.4</NUMEX>We believe it is unlikely that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mihdhar</ENAMEX>-neither of whom, in
                contrast to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hamburg</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, had any prior exposure to life in the West-would have
                come to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> without arranging to receive assistance from one or more
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> informed in advance of their arrival.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> says that though he told <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">others</ENAMEX> involved in the conspiracy to stay away from
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mosques</ENAMEX> and to avoid establishing personal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contacts</ENAMEX>, he made an exception in this
                case and instructed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mihdhar</ENAMEX> to pose as newly arrived <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Saudi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> and
                seek assistance at local mosques. He counted on their breaking off any such
                relationships once they moved to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Coast</ENAMEX>.
            
            Our inability to ascertain the activities of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mihdhar</ENAMEX> during their <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> may reflect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> tradecraft designed to protect the
                identity of anyone who may have assisted them during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that period</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX> and Mihdhar
                were directed to enroll in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English-language</ENAMEX> classes upon arriving in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, so that they could begin pilot training as soon as possible. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> claims
                to have steered the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego</ENAMEX> on the basis of his own research, which
                supposedly included thumbing through a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego</ENAMEX> phone book acquired at a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Karachi</ENAMEX>
                flea market. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Contradicting</ENAMEX> himself, he also says that, as instructed, they attempted
                to enroll in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> language <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>.
            
            After the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> cleared <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Immigration and Customs</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Los Angeles International Airport</ENAMEX>,
                we do not know where they went<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.8</NUMEX>They appear to have obtained assistance from the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX>, specifically the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> surrounding the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fahd</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX> in
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Culver City</ENAMEX>, one of the most prominent mosques in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southern California</ENAMEX>.
            It is fairly certain that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mihdhar</ENAMEX> spent time at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fahd</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX> and
                made some acquaintances there. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witness</ENAMEX> interviewed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> after the
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 11</TIMEX> attacks has said he <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> met the hijackers at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX> in early
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>. Furthermore, one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who would befriend them-a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mohdar</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abdullah-</ENAMEX>recalled a trip with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mihdhar</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June</TIMEX> when, on
                their arrival, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> went to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fahd</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX>. There Hazmi and Mihdhar
                greeted various <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> whom they appeared to have met previously, including a
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> named "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Khallam</ENAMEX>." In <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abdullah</ENAMEX>'s telling, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Khallam</ENAMEX> visited the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">al</ENAMEX> Qaeda
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX> at their motel <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">that evening</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abdullah</ENAMEX> was asked to leave the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> so that
                Hazmi, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mihdhar</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Khallam</ENAMEX> could meet in private. The identity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Khallam</ENAMEX> and his
                purpose in meeting with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mihdhar</ENAMEX> remain unknown.
            
            To understand what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hazmi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mihdhar</ENAMEX> did in their <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>,
                evidently staying in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>, we have investigated whether anyone associated
                with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fahd</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX> assisted them. This subject has received substantial
                attention in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX>. Some have speculated that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fahad al Thumairy</ENAMEX>-an imam at the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mosque</ENAMEX> and an accredited <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diplomat</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Saudi Arabian</ENAMEX> consulate from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> until
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003-</TIMEX>may have played a role in helping the hijackers establish themselves on their
                arrival in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>. This speculation is based, at least in part, on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thumairy</ENAMEX>'s
                reported <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> of an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">extremist faction</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX>.
            
            A well-known <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">figure</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fahd</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX> and within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Los Angeles Muslim</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">community, Thumairy</ENAMEX> was reputed to be an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Islamic</ENAMEX> fundamentalist and a strict
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adherent</ENAMEX> to orthodox <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Wahhabi</ENAMEX> doctrine. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslims</ENAMEX> concerned about his preaching
                have said he "injected non-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Islamic</ENAMEX> themes into his guidance/prayers at the [King
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fahd</ENAMEX>] <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mosque</ENAMEX>" and had <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">followers</ENAMEX> "supportive of the events of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 11</TIMEX>,
                    <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>." <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thumairy</ENAMEX> appears to have associated with a
                particularly radical faction within the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX> of local worshippers, and had a
                network of contacts in other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9/11</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thumairy</ENAMEX>'s
                conduct was a subject of internal debate among some <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Saudi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>. He apparently
                lost his position at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fahd</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX>, possibly because of his immoderate
                reputation. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 6, 2003</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thumairy</ENAMEX> attempted to reenter the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> from
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX> but was refused entry, based on a determination by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX>
                that he might be connected with terrorist activity.
            
            When interviewed by both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thumairy</ENAMEX> has denied
                preaching anti-Western sermons, much less promoting violent jihad. More to the
                point, he claimed not to recognize either <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hazmi</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mihdhar</ENAMEX>. Both denials are
                somewhat suspect. (He likewise denied knowing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Omar al Bayoumi</ENAMEX>-a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego</ENAMEX>
                we will discuss shortly-even though <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witnesses</ENAMEX> and telephone records establish that
                the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> had contact with each other. Similarly, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thumairy</ENAMEX>'s claim not to know
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mohdar</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abdullah</ENAMEX> is belied by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abdullah</ENAMEX>'s contrary assertion.) On the other hand,
                Thumairy undoubtedly met with and provided religious counseling to countless
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> during his tenure at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fahd</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX>, so he might not remember two
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">transients</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hazmi</ENAMEX> and Mihdhar <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several years later</TIMEX>.
            
            The circumstantial evidence makes <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Thumairy</ENAMEX> a logical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> to consider as a possible
                contact for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mihdhar</ENAMEX>. Yet, after exploring the available <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">leads</ENAMEX>, we have not
                found evidence that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thumairy</ENAMEX> provided assistance to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX>.
            
            We do not pick up their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">trail</ENAMEX> until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February 1, 2000</TIMEX>, when they encountered <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Omar al</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bayoumi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Caysan Bin Don</ENAMEX> at a halal food <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Venice Boulevard</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Culver</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">City</ENAMEX>, a few blocks away from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fahd</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bayoumi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Don</ENAMEX> have both
                told us that they had driven up from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego</ENAMEX> earlier <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that day</TIMEX> so that Bayoumi
                could address a visa issue and collect some papers from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Saudi</ENAMEX> consulate. Bayoumi
                heard <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hazmi</ENAMEX> and Mihdhar speaking in what he recognized to be <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gulf</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Arabic</ENAMEX> and struck
                up a conversation. Since <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Don</ENAMEX> knew only a little <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Arabic</ENAMEX>, he had to rely heavily
                on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bayoumi</ENAMEX> to translate for him.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mihdhar</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hazmi</ENAMEX> said they were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX> who had just arrived in
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> to study <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>. They said they were living in an <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> near
                the restaurant but did not specify the address. They did not like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> and
                were having a hard time, especially because they did not know anyone. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bayoumi</ENAMEX> told
                them how pleasant <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego</ENAMEX> was and offered to help them settle there. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> pairs
                then left the restaurant and went their separate ways.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bayoumi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Don</ENAMEX> have been interviewed many times about the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February 1, 2000</TIMEX>,
                lunch. For the most part, their respective accounts corroborate each other. However,
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bayoumi</ENAMEX> has said that he and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Don</ENAMEX> attempted to visit the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fahd</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX> after
                lunch but could not find it. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Don</ENAMEX>, on the other hand, recalls visiting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX>
                twice <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that day</TIMEX> for prayers, both before and after the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">meal</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Don</ENAMEX>'s recollection
                is spotty and inconsistent. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bayoumi's</ENAMEX> version can be challenged as well, since the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mosque</ENAMEX> is close to the restaurant and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bayoumi</ENAMEX> had visited it, and the surrounding
                area, on multiple occasions, including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twice</NUMEX> within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six weeks of February 1</TIMEX>. We do
                not know whether the lunch encounter occurred by chance or design. We know about it
                because <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bayoumi</ENAMEX> told law enforcement that it happened.
            
            Bayoumi, then <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42 years old</TIMEX>, was in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> as a business <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX>, supported
                by a private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">contractor</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saudi Civil Aviation Authority</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bayoumi</ENAMEX> had
                worked for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">over 20 years</TIMEX>.
            
            The object of considerable media speculation following <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9/11</TIMEX>, he lives now in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arabia</ENAMEX>, well aware of his notoriety. Both we and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> have interviewed him and
                investigated evidence about him.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bayoumi</ENAMEX> is a devout <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX>, obliging and gregarious. He spent much of his spare time
                involved in religious study and helping run a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">El Cajon</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 15 miles</NUMEX>
                from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego</ENAMEX>. It is certainly possible that he has dissembled about some aspects
                of his story, perhaps to counter suspicion. On the other hand, we have seen no
                credible evidence that he believed in violent extremism or knowingly aided extremist
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>.
            
            Our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> who have dealt directly with him and studied his background find
                him to be an unlikely candidate for clandestine involvement with Islamist
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">extremists</ENAMEX>. The Move to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego</ENAMEX> By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February 4</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mihdhar</ENAMEX> had come to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">San</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diego</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>, possibly driven by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mohdar Abdullah</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abdullah</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Yemeni</ENAMEX>
                university <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> in his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 20s</TIMEX>, is fluent in both <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Arabic</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, and was
                perfectly suited to assist the hijackers in pursuing their mission.
            
            After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9/11</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abdullah</ENAMEX> was interviewed many times by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>. He admitted knowing of
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mihdhar</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">extremist leanings</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mihdhar</ENAMEX>'s involvement with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Islamic</ENAMEX>
                Army <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">of Aden</ENAMEX> (a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> with ties to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>) back in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abdullah</ENAMEX> clearly was
                sympathetic to those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">extremist</ENAMEX> views. During a post-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX> search of his <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">possessions</ENAMEX>,
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> found a notebook (belonging to someone else) with references to planes
                falling from the sky, mass killing, and hijacking. Further, when detained as a
                material <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witness</ENAMEX> following <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 9/11</TIMEX> attacks, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abdullah</ENAMEX> expressed hatred for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
                government and "stated that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> brought 'this' on themselves."
            
            When interviewed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9/11</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abdullah</ENAMEX> denied having advance knowledge of
                attacks. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 2004</TIMEX>, however, we learned of reports about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abdullah</ENAMEX> bragging to
                fellow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inmates</ENAMEX> at a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prison</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September- October 2003</TIMEX> that he had known
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mihdhar</ENAMEX> were planning a terrorist attack. The stories attributed to
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abdullah</ENAMEX> are not entirely consistent with each other. Specifically, according to one
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inmate</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abdullah</ENAMEX> claimed an unnamed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> had notified him that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX> and
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mihdhar</ENAMEX> would be arriving in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> with plans to carry out an attack. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abdullah</ENAMEX>
                allegedly told the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inmate</ENAMEX> that he had driven the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX> from
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego</ENAMEX>, but did not say when this occurred. We have been unable to
                corroborate this account.
            
            Another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inmate</ENAMEX> has recalled <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abdullah</ENAMEX> claiming he first heard about the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hijackers</ENAMEX>'
                terrorist plans after they arrived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego</ENAMEX>, when they told him they planned to
                fly an airplane into a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> and invited him to join them on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX>. According
                to this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inmate</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abdullah</ENAMEX> also claimed to have found out about the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX> attacks three
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX> in advance, a claim that appears to dovetail with evidence that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abdullah</ENAMEX> may
                have received a phone call from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX> around that time, that he stopped making calls
                from his telephone after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 25, 2001</TIMEX>, and that, according to his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>, he
                started acting strangely.
            
            Although boasts among prison <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inmates</ENAMEX> often tend to be unreliable, this evidence is
                obviously important. To date, neither we nor the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> have been able to verify
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abdullah</ENAMEX>'s alleged jailhouse statements, despite investigative efforts. We thus do
                not know when or how <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mihdhar</ENAMEX> first came to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego</ENAMEX>. We do know that on
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February 4</TIMEX>, they went to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Islamic Center of San Diego</ENAMEX> to find <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Omar al Bayoumi</ENAMEX> and
                take him up on his offer of help. Bayoumi obliged by not only locating an apartment
                but also helping them fill out the lease application, co-signing the lease and, when
                the real estate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> refused to take cash for a deposit, helping them open a bank
                account (which they did with a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$9,900</NUMEX> deposit); he then provided a certified check
                from his own account for which the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX> reimbursed him on the spot
                for the deposit. Neither then nor later did <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bayoumi</ENAMEX> give money to either <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hazmi</ENAMEX> or
                Mihdhar, who had received money from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX>.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mihdhar</ENAMEX> moved in with no furniture and practically no possessions. Soon
                after the move, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bayoumi</ENAMEX> used their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> for a party attended by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 20</NUMEX> male
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX> community. At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bayoumi</ENAMEX>'s request, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Don</ENAMEX> videotaped the
                gathering with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bayoumi's</ENAMEX> video camera. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mihdhar</ENAMEX> did not mingle with the
                other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guests</ENAMEX> and reportedly spent most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> by themselves off camera, in a
                back <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mihdhar</ENAMEX> immediately started looking for a different place to stay. Based on
                their comment to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bayoumi</ENAMEX> about the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> being expensive, one might infer
                that they wanted to save money. They may also have been reconsidering the wisdom of
                living so close to the video camera-wielding <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bayoumi</ENAMEX>, who <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hazmi</ENAMEX> seemed to think was
                some sort of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Saudi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spy</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Just over a week</TIMEX> after moving in, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mihdhar</ENAMEX> filed a
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30-day</TIMEX> notice of intention to vacate. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bayoumi</ENAMEX> apparently loaned them his cell phone
                to help them check out possibilities for new accommodations.
            
            Their initial effort to move turned out poorly. An acquaintance arranged with his
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">landlord</ENAMEX> to have <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mihdhar</ENAMEX> take over his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mihdhar</ENAMEX> put down a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$650</NUMEX> deposit
                and signed a lease for the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> effective <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 1</TIMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Several weeks later</TIMEX>, Mihdhar
                sought a refund of his deposit, claiming he no longer intended to move in because
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> was too messy. When the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">landlord</ENAMEX> refused to refund the deposit,
                Mihdhar became belligerent. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">landlord</ENAMEX> remembers him "ranting and raving" as if he
                were "psychotic."
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mihdhar</ENAMEX> finally found a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> to rent in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">home</ENAMEX> of an individual they had
                met at a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego</ENAMEX>. According to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homeowner</ENAMEX>, the future hijackers moved
                in on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 10, 2000</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mihdhar</ENAMEX> moved out after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">only about a month</TIMEX>. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 9</TIMEX>, he left
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego</ENAMEX> to return to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX>. Hazmi, on the other hand, stayed at this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> for the
                rest of his time in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-December</TIMEX>; he would then leave for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arizona</ENAMEX>
                with a newly arrived <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hijacker-pilot</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hani Hanjour</ENAMEX>.
            
            While in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mihdhar</ENAMEX> played the part of recently arrived foreign
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>. They continued to reach out to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX> community for help.
                At least initially, they found well-meaning new acquaintances at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Islamic Center</ENAMEX>
                of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego</ENAMEX>, which was only a stone's throw from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> where they first
                lived. For example, when they purchased a used <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> (with cash), they bought it from
                a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> who lived across the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Islamic Center</ENAMEX> and who let them use his
                address in registering the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicle</ENAMEX>, an accommodation "to help a fellow <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX>." Similarly, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX>, when their cash supply may have been dwindling, Hazmi
                persuaded the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">administrator</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Islamic Center</ENAMEX> to let him use the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">administrator</ENAMEX>'s
                bank account to receive a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$5,000</NUMEX> wire transfer from someone in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dubai</ENAMEX>, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Emirates</ENAMEX> (this was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nephew</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ali Abdul Aziz Ali</ENAMEX>)<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.29</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX> and Mihdhar
                visited other mosques as well, mixing comfortably as devout worshippers. During the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX>' critical <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">first weeks</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mohdar Abdullah</ENAMEX> helped them.
                Translating between <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Arabic</ENAMEX>, he assisted them in obtaining <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">driver</ENAMEX>'s licenses and with applying to language and flight <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abdullah</ENAMEX> also
                introduced them to his circle of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>; he shared an <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> with some of those
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> near the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rabat</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">La Mesa</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a few miles</NUMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hijackers</ENAMEX>'
                    residence.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abdullah</ENAMEX> has emerged as a key <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">associate</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mihdhar</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego</ENAMEX>. Detained
                after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9/11</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> as a material <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witness</ENAMEX>, then on immigration charges), he was
                deported to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 21, 2004</TIMEX>, after the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Attorney</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southern District</ENAMEX>
                of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> declined to prosecute him on charges arising out of his alleged
                jailhouse admissions concerning the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Justice</ENAMEX>
                declined to delay his removal pending further investigation of this new
                    information.
            
            Other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abdullah</ENAMEX> also translated for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mihdhar</ENAMEX> and helped them
                adjust to life in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego</ENAMEX>. Some held <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">extremist</ENAMEX> beliefs or were well acquainted
                with known <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">extremists</ENAMEX>. For example, immediately after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9/11</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Osama Awadallah</ENAMEX>, a
                Yemeni whose telephone number was found in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hazmi</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toyota</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> Dulles
                <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">International Airport</ENAMEX>, was found to possess photos, videos, and articles relating to
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Awadallah</ENAMEX> also had lived in a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> where copies of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>'s fatwas
                and other similar materials were distributed to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">residents</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Omar Bakarbashat</ENAMEX>, a
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi</ENAMEX>, also met <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hazmi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mihdhar</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rabat</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX>. He admitted helping <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hazmi</ENAMEX> to
                learn <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> and taking over the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX>' <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego</ENAMEX> after
                they moved out. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bakarbashat</ENAMEX> apparently had downloaded stridently <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-American</ENAMEX> Web
                pages to his computer's hard drive.
            
            Another potentially significant <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego</ENAMEX> contact for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mihdhar</ENAMEX> was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anwar</ENAMEX>
                Aulaqi, an imam at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rabat</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX>. Born in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX> and thus a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizen</ENAMEX>,
                Aulaqi grew up in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX> and studied in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> on a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Yemeni</ENAMEX> government
                scholarship. We do not know how or when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hazmi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mihdhar</ENAMEX> first met <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aulaqi</ENAMEX>. The
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX> may even have met or at least talked to him <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the same day</TIMEX> they first moved
                to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mihdhar</ENAMEX> reportedly respected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aulaqi</ENAMEX> as a religious figure
                and developed a close relationship with him.
            
            When interviewed after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9/11</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aulaqi</ENAMEX> said he did not recognize <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX>'s name but did
                identify his picture. Although <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aulaqi</ENAMEX> admitted meeting with Hazmi several times, he
                claimed not to remember any specifics of what they discussed. He described <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hazmi</ENAMEX> as
                a soft-spoken <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Saudi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> who used to appear at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX> with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">companion</ENAMEX> but
                who did not have a large circle of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aulaqi</ENAMEX> left <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-2000</TIMEX>, and by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 2001</TIMEX> had relocated to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX>. As we
                will discuss later, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX> eventually showed up at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aulaqi's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX>, an
                appearance that may not have been coincidental. We have been unable to learn enough
                about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aulaqi</ENAMEX>'s relationship with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mihdhar</ENAMEX> to reach a conclusion.
            
            In sum, although the evidence is thin as to specific motivations, our overall
                impression is that soon after arriving in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mihdhar</ENAMEX> sought out
                and found a group of young and ideologically like-minded <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslims</ENAMEX> with roots in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX>
                and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> mainly associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mohdar Abdullah</ENAMEX> and the Rabat
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mosque</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX> lived openly in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego</ENAMEX> under their true names,
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">listing Hazmi</ENAMEX> in the telephone directory. They managed to avoid attracting much
                attention.
            Flight <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Training Fails</ENAMEX>; Mihdhar Bails Out
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mihdhar</ENAMEX> came to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> to learn <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, take flying lessons,
                and become <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> as quickly as possible. They turned out, however, to have no
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">aptitude</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX>. Even with help and tutoring from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mohdar Abdullah</ENAMEX> and other
                bilingual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mihdhar</ENAMEX>'s efforts to learn proved futile. This lack of
                language skills in turn became an insurmountable barrier to learning how to
                    fly.
            
            A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot</ENAMEX> they consulted at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> school, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sorbi Flying Club</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego</ENAMEX>, spoke
                <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Arabic</ENAMEX>. He explained to them that their flight instruction would begin with small
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mihdhar</ENAMEX> emphasized their interest in learning to fly <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">jets</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aircraft</ENAMEX> in particular, and asked where they might enroll to train on jets right
                away. Convinced that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> were either joking or dreaming, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot</ENAMEX> responded
                that no such school existed. Other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">instructors</ENAMEX> who worked with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX> and Mihdhar
                remember them as poor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> who focused on learning to control the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> in
                flight but took no interest in takeoffs or landings. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of May 2000</TIMEX>, Hazmi
                and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mihdhar</ENAMEX> had given up on learning how to fly.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mihdhar</ENAMEX>'s mind seems to have been with his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> back in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX>, as evidenced by
                calls he made from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> telephone. When news of the birth of his first
                child arrived, he could stand life in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> no longer. In late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX> and early
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June of 2000</TIMEX>, he closed his bank account, transferred the car registration to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hazmi</ENAMEX>,
                and arranged his return to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX>. According to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mihdhar</ENAMEX> was bored in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego</ENAMEX>
                and foresaw no problem in coming back to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> since he had not
                overstayed his visa. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mohdar Abdullah</ENAMEX> accompanied him to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> on
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 9</TIMEX>. After visiting the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fahd</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> last time with his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>, Mihdhar
                left the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the following day</TIMEX>.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> kept in fairly close touch with his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX>, using a variety of methods. When
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> back from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the spring of 2000</TIMEX>, KSM
                asked <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Khallad</ENAMEX> (whom we introduced in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">chapter 5</ENAMEX>) to maintain email contact with Hazmi
                in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mihdhar</ENAMEX>'s decision to strand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego</ENAMEX> enraged <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX>,
                who had not authorized the departure and feared it would compromise the plan. KSM
                attempted to drop <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mihdhar</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX> operation and would have done so, he says,
                had he not been overruled by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>.
            
            Following <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mihdhar</ENAMEX>'s departure, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hazmi</ENAMEX> grew lonely and worried that he would have
                trouble managing by himself. He prayed with his <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">housemate</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">each morning</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5:00 A.M.</TIMEX>
                and attended services at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Islamic Center</ENAMEX>. He borrowed his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">housemate</ENAMEX>'s computer
                for Internet access, following news coverage of fighting in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chechnya</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bosnia</ENAMEX>.
                With his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">housemate</ENAMEX>'s help, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX> also used the Internet to search for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> (after
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">obtaining KSM</ENAMEX>'s approval to marry). This search did not succeed. Although he
                developed a close relationship with his housemate, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX> preferred not to use the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">house</ENAMEX> telephone, continuing the practice he and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mihdhar</ENAMEX> had adopted of going outside
                to make phone calls.
            
            After <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mihdhar</ENAMEX> left, other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> moved into the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of these, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yazeed al</ENAMEX>
                Salmi, stands out. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 2000</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salmi</ENAMEX> purchased <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$4,000</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traveler</ENAMEX>'s checks at a
                bank in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Riyadh</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX>. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 5</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX> deposited <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1,900</NUMEX> of the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">traveler</ENAMEX>'s checks into his bank account, after withdrawing the same amount in cash.
                It is possible that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hazmi</ENAMEX> was simply cashing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traveler</ENAMEX>'s checks for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX>. We
                do not know; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salmi</ENAMEX> claims not to remember the transaction. After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9/11</TIMEX>, Salmi
                reportedly confided to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mohdar Abdullah</ENAMEX> that he had previously known terrorist pilot
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hani Hanjour</ENAMEX>. After living in the same <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about a month</TIMEX>, Salmi
                moved to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">La Mesa</ENAMEX> apartment shared by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abdullah</ENAMEX> and others.
            
            By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fall of 2000</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX> no longer even pretended to study <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> or take flying
                lessons. Aware that his co-conspirators in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> would be sending
                him a new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleague</ENAMEX> shortly, he bided his time and worked for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few weeks</TIMEX> at a gas
                station in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">La Mesa</ENAMEX> where some of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abdullah</ENAMEX>, were employed. On
                <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> occasion, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hazmi</ENAMEX> told a fellow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX> that he was planning to find a better
                job, and let slip a prediction that he would become famous.
            
            On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 8, 2000</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hani Hanjour</ENAMEX> arrived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego</ENAMEX>, having traveled from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dubai</ENAMEX>
                via <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cincinnati</ENAMEX>. Hazmi likely picked up Hanjour at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX>. We do not
                know where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hanjour</ENAMEX> stayed; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few days later</TIMEX>, both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> left <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego</ENAMEX>. Before
                departing, they visited the gas <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">La Mesa</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hazmi</ENAMEX> reportedly
                introduced <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hanjour</ENAMEX> as a "long time <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX>." <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hazmi</ENAMEX> told his
                housemate that he and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hani</ENAMEX>" were headed for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Jose</ENAMEX> to take flying
                lessons and told his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> that he would stay in touch. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hazmi</ENAMEX> promised to return
                to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego</ENAMEX> soon, and he and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hanjour</ENAMEX> drove off.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX> did not sever all contact with his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego</ENAMEX>. According to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abdullah</ENAMEX>,
                after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hazmi</ENAMEX> left <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 2000</TIMEX>, he telephoned <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abdullah</ENAMEX> twice: in
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 2000</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 2001</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hazmi</ENAMEX> said he was in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> and would be
                attending flight school there; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about two weeks later</TIMEX>, he said he was attending
                flight <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arizona</ENAMEX>. Some evidence, which we will discuss later, indicates that
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Hazmi</ENAMEX> contacted <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abdullah</ENAMEX> again, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 2001</TIMEX>. In addition, during the month
                following <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hazmi</ENAMEX>'s departure from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego</ENAMEX>, he emailed his housemate <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times,
                including a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 2001</TIMEX> email that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hazmi</ENAMEX> signed "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smer</ENAMEX>," an apparent attempt to
                conceal his identity that struck the housemate as strange at the time. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX> also
                telephoned his housemate that he and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> had decided to take flight lessons
                in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arizona</ENAMEX>, and that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mihdhar</ENAMEX> was now back in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX>. That was their last contact.
                When the housemate emailed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March of 2001</TIMEX> to find out how he
                was faring, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hazmi</ENAMEX> did not reply.
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">housemate</ENAMEX> who rented the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mihdhar</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX> is an apparently
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">law-abiding citizen</ENAMEX> with long-standing, friendly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">contacts</ENAMEX> among local police and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX>. He did not see anything unusual enough in the behavior of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX> or
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mihdhar</ENAMEX> to prompt him to report to his law enforcement <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contacts</ENAMEX>. Nor did those
                contacts ask him for information about his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tenants</ENAMEX>/housemates.
            THE <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">PILOTS</ENAMEX> IN THE <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UNITED STATES</ENAMEX>
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hamburg Pilots Arrive</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>
            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early summer of 2000</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hamburg</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> arrived in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> to begin
                flight training. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marwan al Shehhi</ENAMEX> came on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 29</TIMEX>, arriving in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Newark</ENAMEX> on a flight
                from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brussels</ENAMEX>. He went to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York City</ENAMEX> and waited there for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mohamed Atta</ENAMEX> to join
                him. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 2</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> traveled to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Czech Republic</ENAMEX> by bus from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> and then
                flew from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Prague</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Newark</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next day</TIMEX>. According to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ramzi Binalshibh</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> did not
                meet with anyone in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Prague</ENAMEX>; he simply believed it would contribute to operational
                security to fly out of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Prague</ENAMEX> rather than <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hamburg</ENAMEX>, the departure point for much of
                his previous international travel.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shehhi</ENAMEX> had not settled on where they would obtain their flight training. In
                contrast, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ziad Jarrah</ENAMEX> had already arranged to attend the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Florida</ENAMEX> Flight Training
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center</ENAMEX> (FFTC) in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venice</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jarrah</ENAMEX> arrived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Newark</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 27</TIMEX> and then flew
                to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venice</ENAMEX>. He immediately began the private pilot program at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FFTC</ENAMEX>, intending to get
                a multi-engine license. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jarrah</ENAMEX> moved in with some of the flight <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">instructors</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">affiliated</ENAMEX> with his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> and bought a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>.
            
            While <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jarrah</ENAMEX> quickly settled into training in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shehhi</ENAMEX> kept searching
                for a flight <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>. After visiting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Airman Flight School</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norman</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oklahoma</ENAMEX>
                (where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zacarias Moussaoui</ENAMEX> would enroll <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several months later</TIMEX> and where another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Qaeda</ENAMEX> operative, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ihab Ali</ENAMEX>, had taken lessons in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid1990s</TIMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> started flight
                instruction at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Huffman Aviation</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venice</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX>, and both <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> and Shehhi
                subsequently enrolled in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Accelerated Pilot Program</ENAMEX> at that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>. By <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the end of</TIMEX>
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July</TIMEX>, both of them took solo flights, and by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-August</TIMEX> they passed the private
                pilot airman test. They trained through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Huffman</ENAMEX>, while Jarrah
                continued his training at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FFTC</ENAMEX>.
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hamburg</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX> paid for their flight training primarily with funds wired from
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dubai</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nephew</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ali Abdul Aziz Ali</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Between June 29 and September 17, 2000</TIMEX>,
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ali</ENAMEX> sent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shehhi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> a total of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$114,500</NUMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> transfers ranging from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$5,000</NUMEX>
                to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$70,000</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ali</ENAMEX> relied on the unremarkable nature of his transactions, which were
                essentially invisible amid the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">billions of dollars</NUMEX> flowing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> across the
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">globe</ENAMEX>.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ali</ENAMEX> was not required to provide identification in sending this money and the aliases
                he used were not questioned.
            
            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-September</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shehhi</ENAMEX> applied to change their immigration status from
                tourist to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX>, stating their intention to study at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Huffman</ENAMEX> until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 1</TIMEX>,
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>. In late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September</TIMEX>, they decided to enroll at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jones Aviation</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sarasota</ENAMEX>,
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 20 miles</NUMEX> north of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venice</ENAMEX>. According to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">instructor</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jones</ENAMEX>, the
                <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> were aggressive, rude, and sometimes even fought with him to take over the
                controls during their training flights. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early October</TIMEX>, they took the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Stage</ENAMEX> I exam
                for instruments rating at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jones Aviation</ENAMEX> and failed. Very upset, they said they were
                in a hurry because jobs awaited them at home. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shehhi</ENAMEX> then returned to
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Huffman</ENAMEX>.
            
            In the meantime, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jarrah</ENAMEX> obtained a single-engine private <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot</ENAMEX> certificate in early
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August</TIMEX>. Having reached that milestone, he departed on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> foreign
                trips he would take after first entering the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX>, he flew back
                to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> to visit his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girlfriend</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aysel Senguen</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> traveled to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> before
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jarrah</ENAMEX> returned to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 29</TIMEX>. His relationship with her remained close
                throughout his time in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. In addition to his trips, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jarrah</ENAMEX> made
                <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of phone calls to her and communicated frequently by email.
            
            Jarrah was supposed to be joined at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FFTC</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ramzi Binalshibh</ENAMEX>, who even sent the
                school a deposit. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Binalshibh</ENAMEX> could not obtain a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> visa. His first
                applications in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 2000</TIMEX> were denied because he lacked established ties in
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> ensuring his return from a trip to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September</TIMEX>, he went
                <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX> to apply for a visa from there, but was denied on grounds that he also
                lacked sufficient ties to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX>, he tried <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> last time, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX>,
                applying for a student visa to attend "aviation language school," but the prior
                denials were noted and this application was denied as well, as incomplete.
            
            Unable to participate directly in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Binalshibh</ENAMEX> instead took on the role
                of coordinating between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. Apart from
                sending a total of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $10,000</NUMEX> in wire transfers to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shehhi</ENAMEX> during the
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer of 2000</TIMEX>, one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Binalshibh</ENAMEX>'s first tasks in his new role as plot coordinator
                was to assist another possible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zacarias Moussaoui</ENAMEX>.
            
            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fall of 2000</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> had sent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moussaoui</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malaysia</ENAMEX> for flight training, but
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moussaoui</ENAMEX> did not find a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> he liked. He worked instead on other terrorist
                schemes, such as buying <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">four tons</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ammonium nitrate</ENAMEX> for bombs to be planted on
                cargo <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX> flying to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. When <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> found out, he recalled Moussaoui
                back to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> and directed him to go to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> for flight training. In
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early October</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moussaoui</ENAMEX> went to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX>. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Binalshibh</ENAMEX> visited <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December</TIMEX>,
                he stayed at the same <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>-room <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dormitory</ENAMEX> where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moussaoui</ENAMEX> was still residing. From
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moussaoui</ENAMEX> sent inquiries to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Airman Flight School</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norman</ENAMEX>,
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oklahoma</ENAMEX>.
            
            Confronting training or travel problems with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi, Mihdhar, Binalshibh</ENAMEX>, and
                Moussaoui, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> was looking for another possible pilot <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX>. A new recruit
                with just the right background conveniently presented himself in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>.
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fourth Pilot</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hani Hanjour</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hani Hanjour</ENAMEX>, from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ta'if</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX>, first came to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX> to
                study at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center for English</ENAMEX> as a Second <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Language</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Arizona</ENAMEX>.
                He seems to have been a rigorously observant <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX>. According to his older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX>,
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hani Hanjour</ENAMEX> went to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 1980s</TIMEX>, as a
                teenager, to participate in the jihad and, because the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviets</ENAMEX> had already
                withdrawn, worked for a relief <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> there.
            
            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hanjour</ENAMEX> returned to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> to pursue flight training, after being
                rejected by a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Saudi</ENAMEX> flight <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>. He checked out flight <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX>,
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arizona</ENAMEX>; and he briefly started at a couple of them before returning
                to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>, he returned to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> and then, along with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>,
                went back to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arizona</ENAMEX> and began his flight training there in earnest. After about
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three months</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hanjour</ENAMEX> was able to obtain his private <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot</ENAMEX>'s license. Several more
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> of training yielded him a commercial pilot certificate, issued by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aviation Administration</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>) in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 1999</TIMEX>. He then returned to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX>.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hanjour</ENAMEX> reportedly applied to the civil aviation <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jeddah</ENAMEX> after returning
                <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX>, but was rejected. He stayed home for a while and then told his family he was
                going to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United Arab Emirates</ENAMEX> to work for an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">airline</ENAMEX>. Where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hanjour</ENAMEX> actually
                traveled during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this time</TIMEX> period is unknown. It is possible he went to the training
                <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camps</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>.
            
            The fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hanjour</ENAMEX> spent so much time in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arizona</ENAMEX> may be significant. A number of
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">important al Qaeda</ENAMEX> figures attended the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Arizona</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tucson</ENAMEX> or lived in
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tucson</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1980s</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 1990s</TIMEX>.
            
            Some of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hanjour</ENAMEX>'s known <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arizona</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">associates</ENAMEX> from the time of his flight training in
                the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late 1990s</TIMEX> have also raised suspicion.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> have speculated that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> may have directed other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">extremist</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslims</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Phoenix</ENAMEX> area to enroll in aviation training. It is clear that when
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Hanjour</ENAMEX> lived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arizona</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1990s</TIMEX>, he associated with several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>
                holding extremist beliefs who have been the subject of counterterrorism
                investigations. Some of them trained with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hanjour</ENAMEX> to be <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX>. Others had apparent
                connections to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>, including training in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>.
            
            By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the spring of 2000</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hanjour</ENAMEX> was back in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>. According to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hanjour</ENAMEX> was
                sent to him in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Karachi</ENAMEX> for inclusion in the plot after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hanjour</ENAMEX> was identified in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">al</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qaeda</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Faruq</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camp</ENAMEX> as a trained <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot</ENAMEX>, on the basis of background information he
                had provided. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hanjour</ENAMEX> had been at a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camp</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few weeks</TIMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bin</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ladin</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atef</ENAMEX> apparently realized that he was a trained <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot</ENAMEX>; he was told to report
                to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX>, who then trained <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hanjour</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few days</TIMEX> in the use of code words.
            
            On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 20</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hanjour</ENAMEX> returned home to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX>. He obtained a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> visa on
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 25</TIMEX> and told his family he was returning to his job in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAE</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hanjour</ENAMEX> did
                go to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAE</ENAMEX>, but to meet <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">facilitator</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ali Abdul Aziz Ali</ENAMEX>.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ali</ENAMEX> opened a bank account in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dubai</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hanjour</ENAMEX> and providing the initial funds for
                his trip. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 8</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hanjour</ENAMEX> traveled to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego</ENAMEX>. His supposed destination was
                an <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> as a second <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">language</ENAMEX> program in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oakland</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, which he had
                scheduled before leaving <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX> but never attended. Instead, as mentioned
                earlier, he joined <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nawaf al Hazmi</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego</ENAMEX>.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hanjour</ENAMEX> left <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego</ENAMEX> almost immediately and drove to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arizona</ENAMEX>. Settling in
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mesa</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hanjour</ENAMEX> began refresher training at his old school, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arizona Aviation</ENAMEX>. He
                wanted to train on multi-engine <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX>, but had difficulties because his <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">English</ENAMEX> was
                not good enough. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">instructor</ENAMEX> advised him to discontinue but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hanjour</ENAMEX> said he could
                not go home without completing the training. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 2001</TIMEX>, he started training on a
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">737</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">simulator</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan Am International Flight Academy</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mesa</ENAMEX>. An <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">instructor</ENAMEX>
                there found his work well below standard and discouraged him from continuing. Again,
                Hanjour persevered; he completed the initial training by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of March 2001</TIMEX>. At
                that point, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hanjour</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hazmi</ENAMEX> vacated their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> and started driving east,
                anticipating the arrival of the "muscle hijackers"-the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX> who would storm
                the cockpits and control the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX>. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">as early as April 4</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hanjour</ENAMEX> and Hazmi
                had arrived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Falls Church</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX>.
            
            The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> continued with their training. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shehhi</ENAMEX> finished
                up at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Huffman</ENAMEX> and earned their instrument certificates from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November</TIMEX>. In
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-December 2000</TIMEX>, they passed their commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot</ENAMEX> tests and received their
                licenses. They then began training to fly large <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">jets</ENAMEX> on a flight <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">simulator</ENAMEX>. At about
                the same time, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jarrah</ENAMEX> began simulator training, also in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> but at a different
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">center</ENAMEX>. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of 2000</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">less than six months</TIMEX> after their arrival, the three
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Coast</ENAMEX> were simulating flights on large <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">jets</ENAMEX>.
            
            Travels in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Early 2001</TIMEX>
            Jarrah, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shehhi</ENAMEX>, having progressed in their training, all took foreign trips
                during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the holiday</TIMEX> period of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000-2001</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Jarrah</ENAMEX> flew through <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> to get <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> to
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beirut</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A few weeks later</TIMEX>, he returned to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Germany</ENAMEX>, with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aysel Senguen</ENAMEX>.
                She stayed with him in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten days</TIMEX>, even accompanying him to a flight
                training session. We do not know whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> knew about
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jarrah</ENAMEX>'s trips and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senguen</ENAMEX>'s visit. The other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX> had broken off regular
                contact with their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>. At <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of January 2001</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jarrah</ENAMEX> again flew to
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beirut</ENAMEX>, to visit his sick <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>. After staying there for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several weeks</TIMEX>, Jarrah
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">visited Senguen</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few days</TIMEX> before returning to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> at
                the end of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February</TIMEX>.
            
            While <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jarrah</ENAMEX> took his personal trips, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> traveled to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> in early <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 2001</TIMEX>
                for a progress meeting with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ramzi Binalshibh</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Binalshibh</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> told him to
                report to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hamburg</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> had
                completed their flight training and were awaiting orders. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> also disclosed that a
                <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hanjour</ENAMEX>, had joined <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX>. Upon returning to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> wired
                Binalshibh travel money. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Binalshibh</ENAMEX> proceeded to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>, made his report, and
                spent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next several months</TIMEX> there and in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>.
            
            When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> returned to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shehhi</ENAMEX> left for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Morocco</ENAMEX>, traveling to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Casablanca</ENAMEX> in
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mid-January</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shehhi</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, concerned about not having heard from him, reported
                him missing to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAE</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAE</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">embassy</ENAMEX> in turn contacted the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hamburg</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAE</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> tried to find him in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>, visiting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mosques</ENAMEX> and
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shehhi</ENAMEX>'s last address in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hamburg</ENAMEX>. After learning that his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> was looking for
                him, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shehhi</ENAMEX> telephoned them on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 20</TIMEX> and said he was still living and studying
                in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hamburg</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAE</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> then told the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hamburg</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> they could call off the
                    search.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shehhi both</ENAMEX> encountered some difficulty reentering the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, on
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 10 and January 18</TIMEX>, respectively. Because neither presented a student visa,
                both of them had to persuade <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inspectors</ENAMEX> that they should be admitted so that
                they could continue their flight training. Neither operative had any problem
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clearing Customs</ENAMEX>.
            
            After returning to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> from their trips, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shehhi</ENAMEX> visited <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Georgia</ENAMEX>, staying
                briefly in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Norcross</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Decatur</ENAMEX>, and renting a single-engine <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> to fly with an
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">instructor</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lawrenceville</ENAMEX>. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February 19</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shehhi</ENAMEX> were in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX>. They
                rented a mailbox in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia Beach</ENAMEX>, cashed a check, and then promptly returned to
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Georgia</ENAMEX>, staying in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stone Mountain</ENAMEX>. We have found no explanation for these travels.
                In mid-March, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jarrah</ENAMEX> was in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Georgia</ENAMEX> as well, staying in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Decatur</ENAMEX>. There is no
                evidence that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> met, although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jarrah</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> apparently spoke on the
                phone. At <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the month</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jarrah</ENAMEX> left the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> again and visited
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senguen</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks</TIMEX>. In early <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shehhi</ENAMEX> returned to
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia Beach</ENAMEX> and closed the mailbox they had opened in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February</TIMEX>.
            
            By the time <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shehhi</ENAMEX> returned to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia Beach</ENAMEX> from their travels in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Georgia</ENAMEX>,
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hanjour</ENAMEX> had also arrived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Falls Church</ENAMEX>. They made their way
                to a large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX> there, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dar al Hijra</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX>, sometime in early <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX>.
            
            As we mentioned <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX>, one of the imams at this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX> was the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anwar Aulaqi</ENAMEX>
                with whom <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hazmi</ENAMEX> had spent time at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rabat</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aulaqi</ENAMEX> had moved to
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Virginia</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 2001</TIMEX>. He remembers <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego</ENAMEX> but has denied having
                any contact with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hanjour</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX>.
            
            At the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dar al Hijra</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hanjour</ENAMEX> met a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jordanian</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eyad al Rababah</ENAMEX>.
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rababah</ENAMEX> says he had gone to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX> to speak to the imam, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Aulaqi</ENAMEX>, about finding
                work. At the conclusion of services, which normally had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400 to 500</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attendees</ENAMEX>,
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rababah</ENAMEX> says he happened to meet <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Hazmi and Hanjour</ENAMEX>. They were looking for an
                apartment; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rababah</ENAMEX> referred them to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> who had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to rent. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX> and Hanjour
                moved into the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX>, which was in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alexandria</ENAMEX>.
            
            Some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> doubt <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rababah</ENAMEX>'s story. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> suspect that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aulaqi</ENAMEX> may
                have tasked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rababah</ENAMEX> to help <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hanjour</ENAMEX>. We share that suspicion, given the
                remarkable coincidence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aulaqi's</ENAMEX> prior relationship with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX>. As noted above,
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> was unable to locate and interview <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Aulaqi</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rababah</ENAMEX> has been deported
                to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jordan</ENAMEX>, having been convicted after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX> in a fraudulent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">driver</ENAMEX>'s license
                    scheme.
            
            Rababah, who had lived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Connecticut</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Jersey</ENAMEX>, told <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX>
                that he had recommended <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paterson</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Jersey</ENAMEX>, as a place with an <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Arabic</ENAMEX>-speaking
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">community</ENAMEX> where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hanjour</ENAMEX> might want to settle. They asked for his help in
                getting them an <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paterson</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rababah</ENAMEX> tried without success. He says he
                then suggested that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hanjour</ENAMEX> travel with him to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Connecticut</ENAMEX> where they
                could look for a place to live.
            
            On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 8</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rababah</ENAMEX> went to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hanjour</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> to pick them up for the trip
                to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Connecticut</ENAMEX>. There he says he found them with new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">roommates-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ahmed al Ghamdi</ENAMEX> and
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Majed Moqed</ENAMEX>. These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> had been sent to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> to serve as muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">hijackers</ENAMEX> and
                had arrived at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Dulles Airport</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 2</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rababah</ENAMEX> drove <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hanjour</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fairfield</ENAMEX>,
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Connecticut</ENAMEX>, followed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hazmi</ENAMEX>, who had <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moqed</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ghamdi</ENAMEX> in his <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX>. After a short
                stay in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Connecticut</ENAMEX>, where they apparently called area flight <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> and real
                estate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rababah</ENAMEX> drove the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paterson</ENAMEX> to have dinner and show them
                around. He says that they returned with him to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fairfield</ENAMEX> that <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>, and that he
                never saw them again.
            
            Within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few weeks</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hanjour, Hazmi</ENAMEX>, and several other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX> moved to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paterson</ENAMEX>
                and rented a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-room <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX>. When their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">landlord</ENAMEX> later paid a visit, he found
                <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> living there-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nawaf al Hazmi</ENAMEX>, now joined by his younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salem</ENAMEX>,
                Hanjour, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moqed</ENAMEX>, probably <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ahmed al Ghamdi</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abdul Aziz al Omari</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hazmi</ENAMEX>'s old
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">friend Khalid al Mihdhar</ENAMEX> would soon join them.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shehhi</ENAMEX> had already returned to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX>. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 11</TIMEX>, they moved into an
                apartment in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Coral Springs</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> stayed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX>, awaiting the arrival of the
                <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">hijackers</ENAMEX>.
            
            Shehhi, on the other hand, bought a ticket to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cairo</ENAMEX> and flew there from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Miami</ENAMEX> on
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 18</TIMEX>. We do not know much more about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shehhi</ENAMEX>'s reason for traveling to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> in
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX> than we know about his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January</TIMEX> trip to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Morocco</ENAMEX>.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shehhi</ENAMEX> did meet with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>, who stated in a post-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX> interview that Shehhi
                just wanted to pick up <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX>'s international <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">driver</ENAMEX>'s license and some money. This
                story is not credible. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> already had the license with him and presented it during
                a traffic stop on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 26</TIMEX> while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shehhi</ENAMEX> was still abroad. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shehhi</ENAMEX> spent about two
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX>, obviously more time than would have been needed just to meet with
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shehhi</ENAMEX> could have traveled elsewhere during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this time</TIMEX>, but no records
                indicating additional travel have been discovered.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shehhi</ENAMEX> returned to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Miami</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 2</TIMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">That day</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jarrah</ENAMEX> were together, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 30</NUMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">miles</ENAMEX> to the north, visiting a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Motor Vehicles</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lauderdale</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lakes</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX>, to get <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">driver</ENAMEX>'s licenses. Back in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX> and
                Hanjour were about to leave for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Connecticut</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Jersey</ENAMEX>. As the summer
                approached, the lead <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX> were settled in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Jersey</ENAMEX>, waiting for
                the rest of their contingent to join them.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ASSEMBLING THE TEAMS</ENAMEX>
            During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX> and early <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">autumn of 2000</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> and senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> in
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> started selecting the muscle hijackers-the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX> who would storm
                the cockpits and control the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX>. Despite the phrase widely used to describe
                them, the so-called muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">hijackers</ENAMEX> were not at all physically imposing; most were
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 5</TIMEX>' <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>" and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>" in height.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Recruitment</ENAMEX> and Selection for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX>
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twelve</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">13</ENAMEX> muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">hijackers</ENAMEX> (excluding <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nawaf al Hazmi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mihdhar</ENAMEX>) came from
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Satam al Suqami</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wail al Shehri</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Waleed al Shehri</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abdul Aziz al</ENAMEX>

                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fayez Banihammad</ENAMEX>, came from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAE</ENAMEX>. He appears to have played a unique role among
                the muscle hijackers because of his work with one of the plot's financial
                facilitators, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mustafa al Hawsawi</ENAMEX>.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Saudi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> interviewed the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and have briefed us on what
                they found. The muscle hijackers came from a variety of educational and societal
                backgrounds. All were <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 20 and 28 years old</TIMEX>; most were unemployed with no more
                than a high school education and were unmarried.

                Haznawi-came from a cluster of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">towns</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">al Bahah</ENAMEX> region, an isolated and
                underdeveloped <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">area</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX>, and shared the same tribal affiliation. None
                had a university degree. Their travel patterns and information from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> members
                suggest that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> may have been in contact with each other as early as the fall
                of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>.
            
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Five more</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wail al Shehri</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Waleed al Shehri</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abdul Aziz al Omari</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mohand al Shehri</ENAMEX>,
                and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ahmed al Nami</ENAMEX>-came from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Asir Province</ENAMEX>, a poor <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> in southwestern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arabia</ENAMEX> that borders <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX>; this weakly policed area is sometimes called "the wild
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">frontier</ENAMEX>." <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wail</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Waleed al Shehri</ENAMEX> were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brothers</ENAMEX>. All <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> had begun
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">university</ENAMEX> studies. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Omari</ENAMEX> had graduated with honors from high school, had attained a
                degree from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Imam Muhammad Ibn Saud</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Islamic University</ENAMEX>, was married, and had a
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX>.
            
            The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> remaining muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">hijackers</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX> were <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Satam al Suqami</ENAMEX>, Majed
                Moqed, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salem al Hazmi</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Suqami</ENAMEX> came from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Riyadh</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Moqed</ENAMEX> hailed from a small town
                called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Annakhil</ENAMEX>, west of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medina</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Suqami</ENAMEX> had very little education, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moqed</ENAMEX> had
                dropped out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">university</ENAMEX>. Neither <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Suqami</ENAMEX> nor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moqed</ENAMEX> appears to have had ties to the
                other, or to any of the other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX>, before getting involved with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">extremists</ENAMEX>,
                probably by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salem al Hazmi</ENAMEX>, a younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nawaf</ENAMEX>, was born in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mecca</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salem</ENAMEX>'s family
                recalled him as a quarrelsome teenager. His <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nawaf</ENAMEX> probably recommended him
                for recruitment into <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> who knew them says that Nawaf
                pleaded with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> to allow <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Salem</ENAMEX> to participate in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 9/11</TIMEX> operation.
            
            Detainees have offered varying reasons for the use of so many <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Saudi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX>.
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Binalshibh</ENAMEX> argues that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> wanted to send a message to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saudi</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arabia</ENAMEX> about its relationship with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. Several other <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">al</ENAMEX> Qaeda
                figures, however, have stated that ethnicity generally was not a factor in the
                selection of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX> unless it was important for security or operational
                    reasons.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX>, for instance, denies that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saudis</ENAMEX> were chosen for the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">9/11</NUMEX> plot to drive a wedge
                between the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX>, and stresses practical reasons for
                considering ethnic background when selecting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX>. He says that so many were
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi</ENAMEX> because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saudis</ENAMEX> comprised the largest portion of the pool of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recruits</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qaeda</ENAMEX> training <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camps</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> estimates that in any given <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camp</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70 percent</NUMEX> of the
                mujahideen were <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Saudi</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 percent</NUMEX> were <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Yemeni</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 percent</NUMEX> were from elsewhere.
                Although <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Saudi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Yemeni</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trainees</ENAMEX> were most often willing to volunteer for suicide
                operations, prior to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX> it was easier for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Saudi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX> to get into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX>.
            
            Most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Saudi</ENAMEX> muscle hijackers developed their ties to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">extremists</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two or three</NUMEX>
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> before the attacks. Their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> often did not consider these young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>
                religious zealots. Some were perceived as devout, others as lacking in faith. For
                instance, although <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ahmed al Ghamdi</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hamza al Ghamdi</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saeed al Ghamdi</ENAMEX> attended
                prayer services regularly and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Omari</ENAMEX> often served as an imam at his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arabia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Suqami</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salem al Hazmi</ENAMEX> appeared unconcerned with religion and, contrary
                to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Islamic</ENAMEX> law, were known to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drink alcohol</ENAMEX>.
            
            Like many other <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Saudis</ENAMEX> who eventually became the muscle
                hijackers were targeted for recruitment outside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>- probably in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arabia</ENAMEX> itself. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Qaeda</ENAMEX> recruiters, certain <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clerics</ENAMEX>, and-in a few cases-family
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> probably all played a role in spotting potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX>. Several of the
                muscle hijackers seem to have been recruited through <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contacts</ENAMEX> at local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">universities</ENAMEX>
                and mosques.
            
            According to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the training <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camps</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>, some were chosen
                by unnamed <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Saudi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sheikhs</ENAMEX> who had contacts with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>. Omari, for example, is
                believed to have been a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> of a radical <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Saudi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cleric</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sulayman al Alwan</ENAMEX>.
                His <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX>, which is located in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">al</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Qassim Province</ENAMEX>, is known among more moderate
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clerics</ENAMEX> as a "terrorist <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">factory</ENAMEX>." The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX> is at the very heart of the strict
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wahhabi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">movement</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saeed al Ghamdi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mohand al Shehri</ENAMEX> also spent
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">al Qassim</ENAMEX>, both breaking with their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>. According to his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>,
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mohand al Shehri</ENAMEX>'s frequent visits to this area resulted in his failing exams at his
                university in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Riyadh</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saeed al Ghamdi</ENAMEX> transferred to a university in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">al Qassim</ENAMEX>, but
                he soon stopped talking to his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> and dropped out of school without informing
                    them.
            
            The majority of these <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Saudi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recruits</ENAMEX> began to break with their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late 1999</TIMEX>
                and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 2000</TIMEX>. According to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX>, some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recruits</ENAMEX> began to make arrangements for
                extended absences. Others exhibited marked changes in behavior before disappearing.
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salem al Hazmi</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> recounted that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Salem</ENAMEX>- who had had problems with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX> and
                petty theft-stopped drinking and started attending <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX> regularly <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three months</TIMEX>
                before he disappeared.
            
            Several family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> remembered that their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> had expressed a desire to
                participate in jihad, particularly in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chechnya</ENAMEX>. None had mentioned going to
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>. These statements might be true or cover stories. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recruits</ENAMEX> from
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">al Ghamdi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tribe</ENAMEX>, for example, all told their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> that they were going to
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chechnya</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only two</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ahmed al Ghamdi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saeed al Ghamdi</ENAMEX>-had documentation suggesting
                travel to a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">republic</ENAMEX>.
            
            Some aspiring <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Saudi</ENAMEX> mujahideen, intending to go to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chechnya</ENAMEX>, encountered difficulties
                along the way and diverted to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ibn al Khattab</ENAMEX>-the primary
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commander</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nationals</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chechnya</ENAMEX>-reportedly had started turning away most
                foreign mujahideen because of their inexperience and inability to adjust to the
                local conditions. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">KSM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> that several of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">9/11</ENAMEX> muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">hijackers</ENAMEX> faced
                problems traveling to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chechnya</ENAMEX> and so went to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>, where they were drawn
                into <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Khallad</ENAMEX> has offered a more detailed story of how such diversions occurred. According
                to him, a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Saudi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mujahideen</ENAMEX> who tried to go to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chechnya</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX> to fight
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russians</ENAMEX> were stopped at the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Georgian</ENAMEX> border. Upon arriving inTurkey,
                they received phone calls at guesthouses in places such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Istanbul</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ankara</ENAMEX>,
                informing them that the route to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chechnya</ENAMEX> via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Georgia</ENAMEX> had been closed. These Saudis
                then decided to travel to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>, where they could train and wait to make
                another attempt to enter <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chechnya</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer of 2000</TIMEX>. While training at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qaeda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camps</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a dozen</NUMEX> of them heard <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>'s speeches, volunteered to become
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">suicide operatives</ENAMEX>, and eventually were selected as muscle hijackers for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX>
                operation. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Khallad</ENAMEX> says he met a number of them at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kandahar</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX>, where they
                were helping to provide extra security. He encouraged <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> to use them. Khallad
                claims to have been closest with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saeed al Ghamdi</ENAMEX>, whom he convinced to become a
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">martyr</ENAMEX> and whom he asked to recruit a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ahmed al Ghamdi</ENAMEX>, to the same cause.
                Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Khallad</ENAMEX> claims not to recall everyone from this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> who was later chosen
                for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 9/11</TIMEX> operation, he says they also included <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Suqami, Waleed and Wail al</ENAMEX>
                Shehri, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Omari, Nami</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hamza al Ghamdi</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salem al Hazmi</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moqed</ENAMEX>.
            
            According to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX> volunteered for suicide operations and, for the most
                part, were not pressured to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">martyr</ENAMEX> themselves. Upon arriving in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>, a
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">recruit</ENAMEX> would fill out an application with standard questions, such as, What brought
                you to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>? How did you travel here? How did you hear about us? What
                attracted you to the cause? What is your educational background? Where have you
                worked before? Applications were valuable for determining the potential of new
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">arrivals</ENAMEX>, for filtering out potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spies</ENAMEX> from among them, and for identifying
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recruits</ENAMEX> with special skills. For instance, as pointed out earlier, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hani Hanjour</ENAMEX>
                noted his pilot training. Prospective <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX> also were asked whether they were
                prepared to serve as suicide <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX>; those who answered in the affirmative were
                interviewed by senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> lieutenant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Muhammad Atef</ENAMEX>.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> claims that the most important quality for any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> operative was willingness
                to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">martyr</ENAMEX> himself. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Khallad</ENAMEX> agrees, and claims that this criterion had preeminence in
                selecting the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX> operation <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> most important criterion was
                demonstrable patience, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Khallad</ENAMEX> says, because the planning for such attacks could
                take <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>.
            
            Khallad claims it did not matter whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hijackers</ENAMEX> had fought in jihad
                previously, since he believes that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> were not looking for such
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX> before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9/11</TIMEX>. But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> asserts that young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mujahideen</ENAMEX> with clean records
                were chosen to avoid raising alerts during travel. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> training <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camp</ENAMEX> head
                mentioned above adds that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX> with no prior involvement in activities likely
                to be known to international security <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> were purposefully selected for the
                <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX> attacks.
            
            Most of the muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">hijackers</ENAMEX> first underwent basic training similar to that given
                other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recruits</ENAMEX>. This included training in firearms, heavy <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX>,
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">explosives</ENAMEX>, and topography. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Recruits</ENAMEX> learned discipline and military life. They were
                subjected to artificial stresses to measure their psychological fitness and
                commitment to jihad. At least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Saudi</ENAMEX> muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">hijackers</ENAMEX> took this basic
                training <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Faruq</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camp</ENAMEX> near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kandahar</ENAMEX>. This particular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camp</ENAMEX> appears to
                have been the preferred location for vetting and training the potential muscle
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hijackers</ENAMEX> because of its proximity to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> and senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX>. Two
                others-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Suqami</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moqed</ENAMEX>-trained at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Khaldan</ENAMEX>, another large basic training facility
                located near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kabul</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mihdhar</ENAMEX> had trained in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-1990s</TIMEX>.
            
            By the time <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX> were picked in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-2000</TIMEX>, some of them
                had been training in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX>, others were just arriving for the first
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>, and still others may have been returning after prior visits to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camps</ENAMEX>.
                According to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> would travel to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camps</ENAMEX> to deliver lectures and meet
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trainees</ENAMEX> personally. If <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> believed a trainee held promise for a special
                operation, that trainee would be invited to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">compound</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tarnak</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Farms</ENAMEX> for further meetings.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> claims that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> could assess new trainees very quickly, in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about ten</TIMEX>
                <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX>, and that many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">9/11</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">hijackers</ENAMEX> were selected in this manner. Bin
                Ladin, assisted by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atef</ENAMEX>, personally chose all the future muscle hijackers for the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">planes</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX>, primarily between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer of 2000 and April 2001</TIMEX>. Upon choosing
                a trainee, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> would ask him to swear loyalty for a suicide operation. After
                the selection and oath-swearing, the operative would be sent to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> for training and
                the filming of a martyrdom video, a function <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> supervised as head of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>'s
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">media</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committee</ENAMEX>.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> sent the muscle hijacker <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recruits</ENAMEX> on to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX> to obtain <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> visas. He
                gave them money (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $2,000</NUMEX> each) and instructed them to return to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> for
                more training after obtaining the visas. At this early stage, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX> were
                not told details about the operation. The majority of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Saudi</ENAMEX> muscle hijackers
                obtained <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> visas in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jeddah</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Riyadh</ENAMEX> between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November of 2000</TIMEX>.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> told potential hijackers to acquire new "clean" passports in their home countries
                before applying for a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> visa. This was to avoid raising suspicion about previous
                travel to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> operated. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Fourteen</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> hijackers, including
                <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Saudi</ENAMEX> muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">hijackers</ENAMEX>, obtained new passports. Some of these passports were
                then likely doctored by the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> passport <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kandahar</ENAMEX>, which would add
                or erase entry and exit stamps to create "false trails" in the passports.
            
            In addition to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX> who eventually participated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 9/11</TIMEX> attacks as
                muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">hijackers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> apparently selected <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least nine</NUMEX> other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Saudis</ENAMEX> who, for
                various reasons, did not end up taking part in the operation: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mohamed Mani Ahmad al</ENAMEX>
                Kahtani, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Khalid Saeed Ahmad al Zahrani</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ali Abd al Rahman al Faqasi al Ghamdi</ENAMEX>, Saeed
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Baluchi</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Qutaybah al Najdi</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zuhair al Thubaiti</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saeed Abdullah Saeed al Ghamdi</ENAMEX>,
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saud al Rashid</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mushabib al Hamlan</ENAMEX>. A <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tenth</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tunisian</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canadian</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">citizenship</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abderraouf Jdey</ENAMEX>, may have been a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> to participate in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9/11</TIMEX>,
                or he may have been a candidate for a later attack. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> hijackers either
                backed out, had trouble obtaining needed travel documents, or were removed from the
                operation by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Khallad</ENAMEX> believes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> wanted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between four</NUMEX> and
                <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">KSM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> had originally planned to use <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>
                or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX> hijackers but ended up with only the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX>.
            
            Final <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Training</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deployment</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>
            Having acquired <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> visas in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX>, the muscle hijackers returned to
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> for special training in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late 2000 to early 2001</TIMEX>. The training reportedly
                was conducted at the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">al Matar</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abu Turab al Jordani</ENAMEX>, one of only a handful
                of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX> who, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX>, was aware of the full details of the
                planned planes operation. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abu Turab</ENAMEX> taught the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX> how to conduct hijackings,
                disarm air marshals, and handle explosives. He also trained them in bodybuilding and
                provided them with a few basic <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> words and phrases.
            
            According to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abu Turab</ENAMEX> even had the trainees <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">butcher</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sheep</ENAMEX> and a camel with a
                knife to prepare to use knives during the hijackings. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recruits</ENAMEX> learned to focus
                on storming the cockpit at the earliest opportunity when the doors first opened, and
                to worry about seizing control over the rest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> later. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX> were
                taught about other kinds of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">attack</ENAMEX> as well, such as truck bombing, so that they
                would not be able to disclose the exact nature of their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX> if they were
                caught. According to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX>, the muscle did not learn the full details-including the
                plan to hijack <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX> and fly them into <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>-before reaching the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX>.
            
            After training in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX> went to a safehouse maintained by KSM
                in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Karachi</ENAMEX> and stayed there temporarily before being deployed to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>
                via the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAE</ENAMEX>. The safehouse was run by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> operative <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abd al Rahim Ghulum</ENAMEX>
                Rabbani, also known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abu Rahmah</ENAMEX>, a close <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">associate</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> who assisted him for
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three years</TIMEX> by finding <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartments</ENAMEX> and lending logistical support to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX> KSM
                would send.
            According to an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> facilitator, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX> were brought to the safehouse by a
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trusted Pakistani al Qaeda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">courier</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abdullah Sindhi</ENAMEX>, who also worked for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX>.
                The future hijackers usually arrived in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two or three</NUMEX>, staying at the safe
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">house</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">as long as two weeks</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">facilitator</ENAMEX> has identified each operative whom
                he assisted at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX>'s direction in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the spring of 2001</TIMEX>. Before the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX> left
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>, each of them received <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$10,000</NUMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> for future expenses.
            
            From <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX> transited through the UAE en route to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX>. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Emirates</ENAMEX> they were assisted primarily by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ali</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abdul Aziz Ali</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mustafa al Hawsawi</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ali</ENAMEX> apparently assisted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> future hijackers
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between April</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 2001</TIMEX> as they came through <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dubai</ENAMEX>. He helped them with plane
                tickets, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traveler</ENAMEX>'s checks, and hotel reservations; he also taught them about
                everyday aspects of life in the West, such as purchasing clothes and ordering <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX>.
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dubai</ENAMEX>, a modern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> with easy access to a major <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX>, travel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX>,
                and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Western</ENAMEX> commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">establishments</ENAMEX>, was an ideal transit point.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ali</ENAMEX> reportedly assumed the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX> he was helping were involved in a big operation
                in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, he did not know the details.
            
            When he asked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> to send him an assistant, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> dispatched <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hawsawi</ENAMEX>, who had worked on
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>'s media <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committee</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kandahar</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hawsawi</ENAMEX> helped send the last <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX>
                (other than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mihdhar</ENAMEX>) to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAE</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hawsawi</ENAMEX> would consult with
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> about the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hijackers</ENAMEX>' travel schedules to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> and later check with
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> to confirm that each had arrived. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hawsawi</ENAMEX> told the muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">hijackers</ENAMEX> that they
                would be met by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hawsawi</ENAMEX> also facilitated some of the
                operation's financing.
            
            The muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">hijackers</ENAMEX> began arriving in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late April 2001</TIMEX>. In most
                cases, they traveled in pairs on tourist visas and entered the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> in
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Orlando</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Miami</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">D.C.</ENAMEX>; or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>. Those arriving in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX>
                were assisted by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shehhi</ENAMEX>, while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hanjour</ENAMEX> took care of the rest. By
                the end of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">15</ENAMEX> muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">hijackers</ENAMEX> had crossed the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX>.
            
            The muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">hijackers</ENAMEX> supplied an infusion of funds, which they carried as a mixture
                of cash and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traveler</ENAMEX>'s checks purchased in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAE</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Seven</NUMEX> muscle
                hijackers are known to have purchased a total of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">nearly $50,000</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traveler</ENAMEX>'s checks
                that were used in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. Moreover, substantial deposits into
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">operatives'U</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">S.</ENAMEX> bank accounts immediately followed the entry of other muscle
                hijackers, indicating that those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">newcomers</ENAMEX> brought money with them as well. In
                addition, muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">hijacker</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Banihammad</ENAMEX> came to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> after opening bank
                accounts in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAE</ENAMEX> into which were deposited the equivalent of approximately
                <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$30,000</NUMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 25, 2001</TIMEX>. After his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 27</TIMEX> arrival in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, Banihammad
                made <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Visa</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATM</ENAMEX> withdrawals from his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAE</ENAMEX> accounts.
            
            The hijackers made extensive use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, choosing both
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">branches</ENAMEX> of major international <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX> and smaller regional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX>. All of the
                hijackers opened accounts in their own name, and used passports and other
                identification documents that appeared valid on their face. Contrary to numerous
                published reports, there is no evidence the hijackers ever used false <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Security</ENAMEX> numbers to open any bank accounts. While the hijackers were not <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> on
                the use of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> financial system, nothing they did would have led the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX> to
                suspect criminal behavior, let alone a terrorist plot to commit mass murder.
            
            The last muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">hijacker</ENAMEX> to arrive was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Khalid al Mihdhar</ENAMEX>. As mentioned <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX>, he
                had abandoned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 2000</TIMEX> and returned to his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX>.
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mihdhar</ENAMEX> reportedly stayed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about a month</TIMEX> before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Khallad</ENAMEX> persuaded him to
                return to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mihdhar</ENAMEX> complained about life in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. He met
                with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX>, who remained annoyed at his decision to go AWOL. But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX>'s desire to drop
                him from the operation yielded to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>'s insistence to keep him.
            
            By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late 2000</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mihdhar</ENAMEX> was in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mecca</ENAMEX>, staying with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cousin</ENAMEX> until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February 2001</TIMEX>, when
                he went home to visit his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> before returning to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 2001</TIMEX>,
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mihdhar</ENAMEX> returned once more to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mecca</ENAMEX> to stay with his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cousin</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">another month</TIMEX>.
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mihdhar</ENAMEX> said that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> was planning <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> attacks on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. Before
                leaving, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mihdhar</ENAMEX> asked his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cousin</ENAMEX> to watch over his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> because of a job
                he had to do.
            
            On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 4, 2001</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mihdhar</ENAMEX> left <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX> to return to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, arriving
                at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">John F. Kennedy International Airport</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mihdhar</ENAMEX> gave his intended
                address as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marriott Hotel</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York City</ENAMEX>, but instead spent <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one night</TIMEX> at another
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX>. He then joined the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of hijackers in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paterson</ENAMEX>, reuniting with
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nawaf al Hazmi</ENAMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than a year</TIMEX>. With <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two months</TIMEX> remaining, all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> hijackers
                were in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> and ready to take the final steps toward carrying out the
                    attacks.
            
            Assistance from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hezbollah</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>
            As we mentioned in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">chapter 2</ENAMEX>, while in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sudan</ENAMEX>, senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> maintained
                contacts with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Iranian</ENAMEX>-supported worldwide terrorist organization
                Hezbollah, which is based mainly in southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lebanon</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beirut</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Qaeda</ENAMEX> members
                received advice and training from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hezbollah</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelligence</ENAMEX> indicates the persistence
                of contacts between <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Iranian</ENAMEX> security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> and senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> figures after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bin</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ladin</ENAMEX>'s return to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Khallad</ENAMEX> has said that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> made a concerted effort to
                strengthen relations with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> after the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 2000</TIMEX> attack on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">USS Cole</ENAMEX>,
                but was rebuffed because <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> did not want to alienate his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supporters</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arabia</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Khallad</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">detainees</ENAMEX> have described the willingness of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Iranian</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> to facilitate the travel of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> through <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX>, on their way to
                and from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Iranian</ENAMEX> border <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inspectors</ENAMEX> would be told not to
                place telltale stamps in the passports of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">travelers</ENAMEX>. Such arrangements were
                particularly beneficial to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Saudi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>.
            
            Our knowledge of the international travels of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX> selected for
                the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX> remains fragmentary. But we now have evidence suggesting that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>
                to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Saudi</ENAMEX> "muscle" <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX> traveled into or out of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> between
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 2000 and February 2001</TIMEX>.
            
            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 2000</TIMEX>, a senior operative of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hezbollah</ENAMEX> visited <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX> to coordinate
                activities there. He also planned to assist <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX> in traveling
                to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November</TIMEX>. A top <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hezbollah</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commander</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Saudi Hezbollah</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contacts</ENAMEX> were
                    involved.
            
            Also in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 2000</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> future muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">hijackers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mohand al Shehri</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hamza al</ENAMEX>
                Ghamdi, flew from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuwait</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ahmed al Ghamdi</ENAMEX> apparently flew to
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beirut</ENAMEX>, traveling-perhaps by coincidence-on the same flight as a senior Hezbollah
                operative. Also in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salem al Hazmi</ENAMEX> apparently flew from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX> to
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beirut</ENAMEX>.
            
            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-November</TIMEX>, we believe, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of the future muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">hijackers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wail al Shehri</ENAMEX>,
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Waleed al Shehri</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ahmed al Nami</ENAMEX>, all of whom had obtained their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> visas in
                late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX>, traveled in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beirut</ENAMEX> and then onward to
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX>. An associate of a senior <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hezbollah</ENAMEX> operative was on the same flight that took
                the future hijackers to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hezbollah</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beirut</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> were expecting
                the arrival of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> during the same time period. The travel of this group was
                important enough to merit the attention of senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">figures</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hezbollah</ENAMEX>.
            
            Later in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> future muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">hijackers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Satam al Suqami</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Majed Moqed</ENAMEX>, flew
                into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bahrain</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February 2001</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Khalid al Mihdhar</ENAMEX> may have taken a flight
                from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Syria</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX>, and then traveled further within <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> to a point near the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Afghan</ENAMEX>
                    border.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Binalshibh</ENAMEX> have confirmed that several of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX> hijackers (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least eight</NUMEX>,
                according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Binalshibh</ENAMEX>) transited <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> on their way to or from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>, taking
                advantage of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Iranian</ENAMEX> practice of not stamping <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Saudi</ENAMEX> passports. They deny any
                other reason for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hijackers</ENAMEX>' travel to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX>. They also deny any relationship
                between the hijackers and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hezbollah</ENAMEX>.
            
            In sum, there is strong evidence that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> facilitated the transit of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> into and out of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9/11</TIMEX>, and that some of these were future
                <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX> hijackers. There also is circumstantial evidence that senior Hezbollah
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX> were closely tracking the travel of some of these future muscle hijackers
                into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November 2000</TIMEX>. However, we cannot rule out the possibility of a
                remarkable coincidence-that is, that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hezbollah</ENAMEX> was actually focusing on some other
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> traveling from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX> during this same time frame, rather
                than the future hijackers.
            
            We have found no evidence that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hezbollah</ENAMEX> was aware of the planning for what
                later became the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX> attack. At the time of their travel through <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">al</ENAMEX> Qaeda
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX> themselves were probably not aware of the specific details of their
                future operation.
            After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9/11</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hezbollah</ENAMEX> wished to conceal any past evidence of cooperation
                with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sunni</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX> associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>. A senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hezbollah</ENAMEX> official
                disclaimed any <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hezbollah</ENAMEX> involvement in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9/11</TIMEX>. We believe
                this topic requires further investigation by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FINAL STRATEGIES AND TACTICS</ENAMEX>
            Final Preparations in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>
            During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early summer of 2001</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX>, assisted by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shehhi</ENAMEX>, was busy coordinating the
                arrival of most of the muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">hijackers</ENAMEX> in southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX>-picking them up at the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">airport</ENAMEX>, finding them places to stay, and helping them settle in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX>.
            
            The majority settled in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX>. Some opened bank accounts, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">acquired mailboxes</ENAMEX>, and
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">rented</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX>. Several also joined local gyms, presumably to stay fit for the
                operation. Upon first arriving, most stayed in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">motels</ENAMEX>; but by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid- June</TIMEX>,
                they settled in shared <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartments</ENAMEX> relatively close to one another and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX>.
            
            Though these muscle hijackers did not travel much after arriving in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of them, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Waleed al Shehri</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Satam al Suqami</ENAMEX>, took unusual trips.
            On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 19</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shehri</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Suqami</ENAMEX> flew from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fort Lauderdale</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Freeport</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bahamas</ENAMEX>,
                where they had reservations at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Bahamas Princess Resort</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> were turned away
                by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bahamian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> on arrival, however, because they lacked visas; they returned
                to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">same day</TIMEX>. They likely took this trip to renew <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Suqami</ENAMEX>'s immigration
                status, as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Suqami</ENAMEX>'s legal stay in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> ended <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 21</TIMEX>.
            
            On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 30</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shehri</ENAMEX> traveled alone from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fort Lauderdale</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX>. He flew to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">San</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francisco</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next day</TIMEX>, where he stayed <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one night</TIMEX> before returning via <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Vegas</ENAMEX>.
                While this travel may have been a casing flight-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shehri</ENAMEX> traveled in <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> class on
                the same type of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> he would help hijack on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 11</TIMEX> (a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">767</ENAMEX>) and
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">the trip</ENAMEX> included a layover in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Vegas</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shehri</ENAMEX> was neither a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot</ENAMEX> nor a plot
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX>, as were the other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hijackers</ENAMEX> who took surveillance flights.
            
            The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hamburg</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shehhi</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jarrah</ENAMEX>-took the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of their
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross</ENAMEX>-country surveillance flights <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early in the summer</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Shehhi</ENAMEX> flew from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> to
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Vegas</ENAMEX> via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late May</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Jarrah</ENAMEX> flew from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baltimore</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Vegas</ENAMEX> via
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early June</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> flew from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Vegas</ENAMEX> via <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> at
                the end of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June</TIMEX>. Each traveled in <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> class, on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Airlines</ENAMEX>. For the east-west
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcontinental</ENAMEX> leg, each operative flew on the same type of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> he would
                pilot on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 11</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shehhi</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">767</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jarrah</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">757</ENAMEX>).
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hanjour</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hazmi</ENAMEX>, as noted below, took similar crosscountry surveillance flights in
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August</TIMEX>.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jarrah</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hanjour</ENAMEX> also received additional training and practice flights in the
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early summer</TIMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A few days</TIMEX> before departing on his cross-country test flight, Jarrah
                flew from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fort Lauderdale</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philadelphia</ENAMEX>, where he trained at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hortman Aviation</ENAMEX> and
                asked to fly the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hudson Corridor</ENAMEX>, a low-altitude "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">hallway</ENAMEX>" along the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hudson River</ENAMEX>
                that passes <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">landmarks</ENAMEX> like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Trade Center</ENAMEX>. Heavy traffic in the
                area can make the corridor a dangerous route for an inexperienced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot</ENAMEX>. Because
                <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hortman</ENAMEX> deemed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jarrah</ENAMEX> unfit to fly solo, he could fly this route only with an
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">instructor</ENAMEX>.
            
            Hanjour, too, requested to fly the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hudson Corridor</ENAMEX> about this same time, at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Fleet</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Training Systems</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Teterboro</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Jersey</ENAMEX>, where he started receiving ground
                instruction soon after settling in the area with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Hanjour</ENAMEX> flew the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hudson</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Corridor</ENAMEX>, but his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">instructor</ENAMEX> declined a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> request because of what he considered
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hanjour</ENAMEX>'s poor piloting skills. Shortly thereafter, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hanjour</ENAMEX> switched to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Caldwell</ENAMEX>
                Flight <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Academy</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fairfield</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Jersey</ENAMEX>, where he rented small <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> on several
                occasions during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June and July</TIMEX>. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> such instance on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 20</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hanjour</ENAMEX>-likely
                accompanied by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hazmi</ENAMEX>-rented a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Caldwell</ENAMEX> and took a practice flight from
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fairfield</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gaithersburg</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maryland</ENAMEX>, a route that would have allowed them to fly
                near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">D.C.</ENAMEX> Other evidence suggests that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hanjour</ENAMEX> may even have returned to
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arizona</ENAMEX> for flight <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">simulator</ENAMEX> training <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier in June</TIMEX>.
            
            There is no indication that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shehhi</ENAMEX> received any additional flight training in
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June</TIMEX>. Both were likely too busy organizing the newly arrived muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">hijackers</ENAMEX> and
                taking their cross-country surveillance flights. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX>, moreover, needed to
                coordinate with his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">second-in-command</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nawaf al Hazmi</ENAMEX>.
            
            Although <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hazmi</ENAMEX> appear to have been in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX> at about the same time in
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early April</TIMEX>, they probably did not meet then. Analysis of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late April</TIMEX> communications
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> indicates that they had wanted to get together in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX> but
                could not coordinate the meeting.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hazmi</ENAMEX> probably first met in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> only when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hazmi</ENAMEX> traveled
                round-trip from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Newark</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Miami</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between June 19 and June 25</TIMEX>.
            After he returned to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Jersey</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX>'s behavior began to closely parallel that of
                the other hijackers. He and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hanjour</ENAMEX>, for instance, soon established new bank
                accounts, acquired a mailbox, rented <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX>, and started visiting a gym. So did the
                <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hijackers</ENAMEX> who evidently were staying with them in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Jersey</ENAMEX>. Several
                also obtained new photo identification, <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Jersey</ENAMEX> and then at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Department</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Motor Vehicles</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hanjour</ENAMEX> had obtained such documents
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months earlier</TIMEX>, likely with help from their <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jordanian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rababah</ENAMEX>.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> probably met again with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early July</TIMEX>. Returning from his initial
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross</ENAMEX>-country surveillance flight, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> flew into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>. Rather than return
                immediately to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX>, he checked into a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Jersey</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX>. He picked up tickets to
                travel to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> at a travel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paterson</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 4</TIMEX> before departing for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fort</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lauderdale</ENAMEX>. Now that the muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">hijackers</ENAMEX> had arrived, he was ready to meet with
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ramzi Binalshibh</ENAMEX> for the last time.
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Meeting</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>
            After meeting with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 2001</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Binalshibh</ENAMEX> had spent much of the
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">spring of 2001</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>, helping move the muscle hijackers as
                they passed through <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Karachi</ENAMEX>. During the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX> meeting, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> had agreed to meet
                later in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuala Lumpur</ENAMEX> to discuss the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX> in person again. In late
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">May, Binalshibh</ENAMEX> reported directly to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> at an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> known as
                "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Compound Six</ENAMEX>" near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kandahar</ENAMEX>.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> told <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Binalshibh</ENAMEX> to instruct <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> and the others to focus on their security
                and that of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX>, and to advise <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> to proceed as planned with the targets
                discussed before <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> left <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 2000</TIMEX>-the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Trade Center</ENAMEX>, the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Capitol</ENAMEX>. According to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Binalshibh</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> said
                he preferred the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Capitol</ENAMEX>, asking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Binalshibh</ENAMEX> to confirm that
                Atta understood this preference. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Binalshibh</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> had given the same
                message to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Waleed al Shehri</ENAMEX> for conveyance to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">spring</TIMEX>. Binalshibh
                also received permission to meet <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malaysia</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atef</ENAMEX> provided money for the trip,
                which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> would help <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Binalshibh</ENAMEX> arrange in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Karachi</ENAMEX>.
            
            In early <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Binalshibh</ENAMEX> traveled by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">taxi</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kandahar</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quetta</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>, where
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">courier</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abu Rahmah</ENAMEX> took him to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX>. According to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Binalshibh</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> provided a
                plane ticket to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malaysia</ENAMEX> and a fraudulent <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Saudi</ENAMEX> passport to use for the trip. KSM
                told him to ask <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> to select a date for the attacks. Binalshibh was to return to
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> and then inform <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">KSM</ENAMEX> of the date. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> also gave <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Binalshibh</ENAMEX> the email address
                of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zacarias Moussaoui</ENAMEX> for future contact. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Binalshibh</ENAMEX> then left for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kuala</ENAMEX>
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lumpur</ENAMEX>.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Binalshibh</ENAMEX> contacted <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> upon arriving in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malaysia</ENAMEX> and found a change in plan. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Atta</ENAMEX>
                could not travel because he was too busy helping the new arrivals settle in the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX>. After remaining in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malaysia</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">approximately three weeks</TIMEX>, Binalshibh
                went to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bangkok</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few days</TIMEX> before returning to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>. He and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> agreed to
                meet later at a location to be determined.
            
            In early <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Binalshibh</ENAMEX> to suggest meeting in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX>, for reasons
                Binalshibh claims not to know. He says he preferred <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX>, but that he and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX>
                knew too many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> and feared being spotted together. Unable to buy a
                ticket to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX> at the height of the tourist season, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Binalshibh</ENAMEX> booked a seat on a
                flight to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reus</ENAMEX>, near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barcelona</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next day</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> was already en route to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX>,
                so <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Binalshibh</ENAMEX> phoned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shehhi</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> to inform him of the change in
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">itinerary</ENAMEX>.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> arrived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 8</TIMEX>. He spent <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the night</TIMEX> in a hotel and made <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> calls
                from his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>, most likely to coordinate with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Binalshibh</ENAMEX>. The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next day</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> rented
                a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> and drove to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reus</ENAMEX> to pick up Binalshibh; the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> then drove to the nearby town
                of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cambrils</ENAMEX>. Hotel records show <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> renting <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> in the same area until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 19</TIMEX>,
                when he returned his rental car in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madrid</ENAMEX> and flew back to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fort Lauderdale</ENAMEX>. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July</TIMEX>
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Binalshibh</ENAMEX> returned to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hamburg</ENAMEX>, using a ticket <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> had purchased for him
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier that day</TIMEX>. According to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Binalshibh</ENAMEX>, they did not meet with anyone else while
                in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Binalshibh</ENAMEX> says he told <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> wanted the attacks carried out as soon as
                possible. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Binalshibh</ENAMEX> conveyed, was worried about having so many
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> replied that he could not yet provide a date
                because he was too busy organizing the arriving hijackers and still needed to
                coordinate the timing of the flights so that the crashes would occur simultaneously.
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> said he required <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about five to six weeks</TIMEX> before he could provide an attack
                date. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Binalshibh</ENAMEX> advised <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> had directed that the other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX>
                not be informed of the date until <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the last minute</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> was to provide Binalshibh
                with advance notice of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least a week or two</TIMEX> so that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Binalshibh</ENAMEX> could travel to
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> and report <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the date</TIMEX> personally to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>.
            
            As to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">targets</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta understood Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>'s interest in striking the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Atta</ENAMEX>
                said he thought this target too difficult, but had tasked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hanjour</ENAMEX> to
                evaluate its feasibility and was awaiting their answer. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> said that those two
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">operatives</ENAMEX> had rented small <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> and flown reconnaissance flights near the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> explained that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hanjour</ENAMEX> was assigned to attack the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX>, Jarrah
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Capitol</ENAMEX>, and that both <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shehhi</ENAMEX> would hit the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Trade Center</ENAMEX>. If any
                pilot could not reach his intended <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">target</ENAMEX>, he was to crash the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX>. If <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> could
                not strike the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Trade Center</ENAMEX>, he planned to crash his <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> directly into
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> told <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Binalshibh</ENAMEX> that each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot</ENAMEX> had volunteered for
                his assigned target, and that the assignments were subject to change.
            
            During the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> meeting, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> also mentioned that he had considered targeting a
                nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> he had seen during familiarization flights near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>-a target
                they referred to as "electrical engineering." According to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Binalshibh</ENAMEX>, the other
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> did not like the idea. They thought a nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX> would be difficult
                because the airspace around it was restricted, making reconnaissance flights
                impossible and increasing the likelihood that any <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> would be shot down before
                impact. Moreover, unlike the approved targets, this alternative had not been
                discussed with senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> and therefore did not have the requisite
                blessing. Nor would a nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> have particular symbolic value. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> did not
                ask <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Binalshibh</ENAMEX> to pass this idea on to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Atef</ENAMEX>, or KSM, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Binalshibh</ENAMEX> says
                he did not mention it to them until after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 11</TIMEX>.
            
            Binalshibh claims that during their time in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>, he and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> also discussed how the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hijackings</ENAMEX> would be executed. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> said he, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shehhi</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jarrah</ENAMEX> had encountered no
                problems carrying box cutters on cross-country surveillance flights. The best time
                to storm the cockpit would be <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 10-15 minutes</TIMEX> after takeoff, when the cockpit
                doors typically were opened for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> did not believe they would need
                any other <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX>. He had no firm contingency plan in case the cockpit door was
                locked. While he mentioned general ideas such as using a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hostage</ENAMEX> or claiming to have
                a bomb, he was confident the cockpit doors would be opened and did not consider
                breaking them down a viable idea. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> told <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Binalshibh</ENAMEX> he wanted to select planes
                departing on long flights because they would be full of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fuel</ENAMEX>, and that he wanted to
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hijack Boeing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> because he believed them easier to fly than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Airbus</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>,
                which he understood had an autopilot feature that did not allow them to be crashed
                into the ground.
            
            Finally, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> confirmed that the muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">hijackers</ENAMEX> had arrived in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>
                without incident. They would be divided into <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> according to their
                English-speaking ability. That way they could assist each other before the operation
                and each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> would be able to command the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>. According to
                Binalshibh, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> complained that some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hijackers</ENAMEX> wanted to contact their
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> to say goodbye, something he had forbidden. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX>, moreover, was nervous
                about his future communications with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Binalshibh</ENAMEX>, whom he instructed to obtain new
                telephones upon returning to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>. Before <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Binalshibh</ENAMEX> left <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>, he gave <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX>
                <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> necklaces and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> bracelets that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> had asked him to buy when he was
                recently in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bangkok</ENAMEX>, believing that if the hijackers were clean shaven and well
                dressed, others would think them wealthy <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudis</ENAMEX> and give them less notice.
            
            As directed, upon returning from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Binalshibh</ENAMEX> obtained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> new phones, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to
                communicate with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> and another to communicate with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> and others, such as
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zacarias Moussaoui</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Binalshibh</ENAMEX> soon contacted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> and, using code words, reported
                the results of his meeting with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX>. This important exchange occurred in
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mid-July</ENAMEX>.
            
            The conversation covered various topics. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jarrah</ENAMEX> was to send Binalshibh
                certain personal materials from the hijackers, including copies of their passports,
                which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Binalshibh</ENAMEX> in turn would pass along to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX>, probably for subsequent use in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">al</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Qaeda</ENAMEX> propaganda.
            
            The most significant part of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-July</TIMEX> conversation concerned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jarrah</ENAMEX>'s troubled
                relationship with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Binalshibh</ENAMEX> both acknowledge that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jarrah</ENAMEX> chafed under
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX>'s authority over him. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Binalshibh</ENAMEX> believes the disagreement arose in part from
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jarrah</ENAMEX>'s family visits. Moreover, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jarrah</ENAMEX> had been on his own for most of his time in
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Binalshibh</ENAMEX>'s visa difficulty had prevented the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of them
                from training together. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jarrah</ENAMEX> thus felt excluded from the decisionmaking.
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Binalshibh</ENAMEX> had to act as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">broker</ENAMEX> between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jarrah</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX>.
            
            Concerned that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jarrah</ENAMEX> might withdraw from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX> at this late stage, KSM
                emphasized the importance of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jarrah</ENAMEX>'s resolving their differences.
                Binalshibh claims that such <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> was unwarranted, and in their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid- July</TIMEX>
                discussion reassured <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jarrah</ENAMEX> would reconcile and be ready to move
                forward in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about a month</TIMEX>, after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jarrah</ENAMEX> visited his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>. Noting his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> and
                the potential for delay, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> point instructed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Binalshibh</ENAMEX> to send "the skirts"
                to "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Sally</ENAMEX>"-a coded instruction to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Binalshibh</ENAMEX> to send funds to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zacarias Moussaoui</ENAMEX>.
                While <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Binalshibh</ENAMEX> admits <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> did direct him to send <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Moussaoui</ENAMEX> money during the
                mid-July conversation, he denies knowing exactly why he received this
                instruction-though he thought the money was being provided "within the framework" of
                the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX>.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> may have instructed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Binalshibh</ENAMEX> to send money to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moussaoui</ENAMEX> in order to help
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">prepare Moussaoui</ENAMEX> as a potential substitute <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jarrah</ENAMEX>. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 20, 2001</TIMEX>,
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aysel Senguen, Jarrah</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">girlfriend</ENAMEX>, purchased a one-way ticket for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jarrah</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Miami</ENAMEX>
                to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dusseldorf</ENAMEX>. On <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jarrah</ENAMEX>'s previous <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> trips from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> to see Senguen
                and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lebanon</ENAMEX>, he had always traveled with a round-trip ticket. When
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jarrah</ENAMEX> departed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Miami</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 25</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> appears to have driven him to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX>,
                another unique circumstance.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Binalshibh</ENAMEX> picked up Jarrah at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dusseldorf</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 25</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jarrah</ENAMEX> wanted to
                see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Senguen</ENAMEX> as soon as possible, so he and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Binalshibh</ENAMEX> arranged to meet <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few days</TIMEX>
                later. When they did, they had an emotional conversation during which Binalshibh
                encouraged <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jarrah</ENAMEX> to see the plan through.
            
            While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jarrah</ENAMEX> was in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Binalshibh</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moussaoui</ENAMEX> were in contact to arrange for
                the transfer of funds. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Binalshibh</ENAMEX> received <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> wire transfers from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hawsawi</ENAMEX> in the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAE</ENAMEX> totaling <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$15,000</NUMEX> and, within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>, relayed almost all of this money to Moussaoui
                in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> installments.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moussaoui</ENAMEX> had been taking flight lessons at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Airman Flight School</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norman</ENAMEX>,
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oklahoma</ENAMEX>, since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February</TIMEX> but stopped in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late May</TIMEX>. Although at that point he had only
                <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 50</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> of flight time and no solo flights to his credit, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moussaoui</ENAMEX> began
                making inquiries about flight materials and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">simulator</ENAMEX> training for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">747s</ENAMEX>. On
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 10</TIMEX>, he put down a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1,500</NUMEX> deposit for flight <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">simulator</ENAMEX> training at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan Am</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Flight Academy</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Eagan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minnesota</ENAMEX>, and by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the month</TIMEX>, he
                had received a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">simulator</ENAMEX> schedule to train from
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 13</TIMEX> through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 20</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moussaoui</ENAMEX> also purchased <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> knives and inquired of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturers</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPS</ENAMEX> equipment whether their products could be converted for
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aeronautical</ENAMEX> use-activities that closely resembled those of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX> hijackers
                during their final preparations for the attacks.
            
            On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 10</TIMEX>, shortly after getting the money from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Binalshibh</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moussaoui</ENAMEX> left
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oklahoma</ENAMEX> with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> and drove to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minnesota</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Three days later</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moussaoui</ENAMEX> paid the
                <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$6,800</NUMEX> balance owed for his flight <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">simulator</ENAMEX> training at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan Am</ENAMEX> in cash and began
                his training. His conduct, however, raised the suspicions of his flight <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">instructor</ENAMEX>.
                It was unusual for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> with so little training to be learning to fly large
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">jets</ENAMEX> without any intention of obtaining a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot</ENAMEX>'s license or other goal. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August</TIMEX>
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>, once the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">instructor</ENAMEX> reported his suspicion to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moussaoui</ENAMEX> was
                arrested by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INS</ENAMEX> on immigration charges.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> denies ever considering <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moussaoui</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX> operation. Instead he claims
                that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moussaoui</ENAMEX> was slated to participate in a "second wave" of attacks. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> also
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moussaoui</ENAMEX> had no contact with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX>, and we are unaware of evidence
                contradicting this assertion.
            
            Yet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> has also stated that by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer of 2001</TIMEX>, he was too busy with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX>
                operation to continue planning for any <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>-wave attacks. Moreover, he admits that
                <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only three</NUMEX> potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> were ever recruited for the alleged second wave,
                Moussaoui plus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> others who, by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">midsummer of 2001</TIMEX>, had backed out of the
                    plot.
            
            We therefore believe that the effort to push <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Moussaoui</ENAMEX> forward in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 2001</TIMEX> lends
                credence to the suspicion that he was being primed as a possible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot</ENAMEX> in the
                immediate planes operation. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Binalshibh</ENAMEX> says he assumed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moussaoui</ENAMEX> was to take his
                place as another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 9/11</TIMEX> operation. Recounting a post-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX> discussion with
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kandahar</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Binalshibh</ENAMEX> claims <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">KSM</ENAMEX> mentioned <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moussaoui</ENAMEX> as being part of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX>
                operation. Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> never referred to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moussaoui</ENAMEX> by name, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Binalshibh</ENAMEX> understood
                he was speaking of the operative to whom <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Binalshibh</ENAMEX> had wired money. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Binalshibh</ENAMEX> says
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> did not approve of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moussaoui</ENAMEX> but believes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> did not remove him from the
                operation only because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moussaoui</ENAMEX> had been selected and assigned by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>
                    himself.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> did not hear about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moussaoui</ENAMEX>'s arrest until after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 11</TIMEX>. According to
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Binalshibh, had Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> learned prior to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moussaoui</ENAMEX> had been
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">detained</ENAMEX>, they might have canceled the operation. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Binalshibh</ENAMEX> discussed
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moussaoui</ENAMEX>'s arrest with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 11</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> congratulated himself on not
                having Moussaoui contact the other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX>, which would have compromised the
                operation. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moussaoui</ENAMEX> had been in contact with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Binalshibh</ENAMEX>, of course, but this was
                not discovered until after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9/11</TIMEX>. As it turned out,
                Moussaoui was not needed to replace <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jarrah</ENAMEX>. By the time <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moussaoui</ENAMEX> was arrested in
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mid-August</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jarrah</ENAMEX> had returned to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> from his final trip to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>,
                his disagreement with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> apparently resolved. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX> began their final
                preparations for the attacks.
            
            Readying the Attacks
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A week</TIMEX> after he returned from meeting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Binalshibh</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> traveled to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Newark</ENAMEX>,
                probably to coordinate with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX> and give him additional funds. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> spent a few
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> in the area before returning to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 30</TIMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">The month of August</TIMEX> was
                busy, as revealed by a set of contemporaneous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Atta- Binalshibh</ENAMEX> communications that
                were recovered after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 11</TIMEX>.
            
            On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 3</TIMEX>, for example, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Binalshibh</ENAMEX> discussed several matters, such as the
                best way for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX> to purchase <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> tickets and the assignment of muscle
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hijackers</ENAMEX> to individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Binalshibh</ENAMEX> also revisited the question of
                whether to target the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>. They discussed targets in coded language,
                pretending to be <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> discussing various fields of study: "architecture"
                referred to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Trade Center</ENAMEX>, "arts" the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX>,"law" the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Capitol</ENAMEX>, and
                "politics" the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Binalshibh</ENAMEX> reminded <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> wanted to target the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> again
                cautioned that this would be difficult. When <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Binalshibh</ENAMEX> persisted, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> agreed to
                include the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> but suggested they keep the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Capitol</ENAMEX> as an alternate target
                in case the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> proved too difficult. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> also suggested that the attacks
                would not happen until after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first week</TIMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September</TIMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reconvened</ENAMEX>.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Binalshibh</ENAMEX> also discussed "the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> who is coming as a tourist"- a cryptic
                reference to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate hijacker</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mohamed al Kahtani</ENAMEX> (mentioned above), whom <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hawsawi</ENAMEX>
                was sending <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next day</TIMEX> as "the last <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>" to "complete the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>." On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 4</TIMEX>,
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> drove to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Orlando</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX> to meet <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kahtani</ENAMEX>. Upon arrival, however, Kahtani
                was denied entry by immigration <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> because he had a one-way ticket and little
                money, could not speak <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, and could not adequately explain what he intended to
                do in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. He was sent back to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dubai</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Hawsawi</ENAMEX> contacted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX>, who told
                him to help <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kahtani</ENAMEX> return to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>.
            
            On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 7</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> flew from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fort Lauderdale</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Newark</ENAMEX>, probably to coordinate with
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Two days later</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ahmed al Ghamdi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abdul Aziz al Omari</ENAMEX>, who had been living
                in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Jersey</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hanjour</ENAMEX>, flew to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Miami</ENAMEX>-probably signifying that the
                <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> hijacking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> had finally been assigned. While <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> was in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Jersey</ENAMEX>, he,
                Hazmi, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hanjour</ENAMEX> all purchased tickets for another set of surveillance flights.
                Like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shehhi, Jarrah</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Waleed al Shehri</ENAMEX> before them, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hanjour</ENAMEX> each
                flew in <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> class on the same type of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> they would hijack on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9/11</TIMEX> (a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX>
                <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">757</NUMEX>), and on transcontinental flights that connected to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Vegas</ENAMEX>. This time,
                however, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> himself also flew directly to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Vegas</ENAMEX>, where <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> stayed on
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 13-14</TIMEX>. Beyond <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Vegas</ENAMEX>'s reputation for welcoming <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX>, we have seen no
                credible evidence explaining why, on this occasion and others, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX> flew
                to or met in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Vegas</ENAMEX>.
            
            Through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August</TIMEX>, the hijackers kept busy with their gym training and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> took
                frequent practice flights on small rented <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX> also began to
                make purchases suggesting that the planning was coming to an end. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-August</TIMEX>, for
                example, they bought small knives that may actually have been used in the attacks.
                On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 22</TIMEX>, moreover, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jarrah</ENAMEX> attempted to purchase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> from a pilot
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">shop</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Miami</ENAMEX>. He was able to buy <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX>, which he picked up <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few days later</TIMEX>
                when he also purchased <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> aeronautical charts.
            
            Perhaps most significant, however, was the purchase of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> tickets for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September</TIMEX>
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 23</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> again flew to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Newark</ENAMEX>, probably to meet with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX> and select
                flights. All <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> tickets were booked and purchased between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 25 and September</TIMEX>
                    <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>.
            
            It therefore appears that the attack date was selected by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the third week of August</TIMEX>.
                This timing is confirmed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Binalshibh</ENAMEX>, who claims <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> called him with the date in
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mid-August</ENAMEX>. According to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Binalshibh</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> used a riddle to convey the date in code-a
                message of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branches</ENAMEX>, a slash, and a lollipop (to non-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11/9</NUMEX> would be
                interpreted as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 11</TIMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Binalshibh</ENAMEX> says he called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> back to confirm the
                date before passing it to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX>.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> apparently received <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the date</TIMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Binalshibh</ENAMEX> in a message sent through
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Binalshibh</ENAMEX>'s old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hamburg</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">associate</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zakariya Essabar</ENAMEX>. Both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Binalshibh</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> claim
                that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Essabar</ENAMEX> was not privy to the meaning of the message and had no foreknowledge of
                the attacks. According to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Binalshibh</ENAMEX>, shortly after the date was chosen, he advised
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Essabar</ENAMEX> and another <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hamburg</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">associate</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Said Bahaji</ENAMEX>, that if they wanted to go to
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>, now was the time because it would soon become more difficult. Essabar
                made reservations on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 22</TIMEX> and departed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hamburg</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Karachi</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 30</TIMEX>; Bahaji
                purchased his tickets on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 20</TIMEX> and departed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hamburg</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Karachi</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September</TIMEX>
                    <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Binalshibh</ENAMEX> also made arrangements to leave for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early September</TIMEX>,
                before the attacks, as did <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ali</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hawsawi</ENAMEX>, the plot facilitators in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAE</ENAMEX>. During
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these final days</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Binalshibh</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> kept in contact by phone, email, and instant
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">messaging</ENAMEX>. Although <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> had forbidden the hijackers to contact their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>, he
                apparently placed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> last call to his own <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 9</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> also asked
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Binalshibh</ENAMEX> to contact the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> hijacker, pass along goodbyes from others,
                and give regards to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jarrah</ENAMEX> alone appears to have left a written farewell-a
                sentimental letter to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aysel Senguen</ENAMEX>.
            
            Hazmi, however, may not have been so discreet. He may have telephoned his former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">San</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diego</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">companion</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mohdar Abdullah</ENAMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late August</TIMEX>. Several bits of evidence indicate
                that others in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abdullah</ENAMEX>'s circle may have received word that something big would
                soon happen. As noted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abdullah</ENAMEX>'s behavior reportedly changed noticeably.
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Prior to September 11</TIMEX>, both he and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yazeed al Salmi</ENAMEX> suddenly became intent on
                proceeding with their planned marriages. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witness</ENAMEX> quotes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salmi</ENAMEX> as commenting
                after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 9/11</TIMEX> attacks, "I knew they were going to do something, that is why I got
                married." Moreover, as of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 2001</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iyad Kreiwesh</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> at the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texaco</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX> where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX> had worked suddenly were anticipating attention from law
                enforcement <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> in the near future. Finally, according to an uncorroborated
                witness account, early on <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 10</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abdullah</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Osama Awadallah</ENAMEX>,
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Omar Bakarbashat</ENAMEX>, and others behaved suspiciously at the gas <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX>. According to
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witness</ENAMEX>, after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> met, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Awadallah</ENAMEX> said "it is finally going to happen" as
                the others celebrated by giving each other high fives.
            
            Dissent within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda Leadership</ENAMEX> While tactical preparations for the attack
                were nearing completion, the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX> was being questioned at the top, as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qaeda</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Taliban</ENAMEX> argued over strategy for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>. Our focus has naturally been on
                the specifics of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX> operation. But from the perspective of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> and
                Atef, this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX>, admittedly key, element of their unfolding plans
                for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX>. Living in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">interacting</ENAMEX> constantly with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qaeda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> would never lose sight of the situation in that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>'s
                consistent priority was to launch a major attack directly against the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>.
                He wanted the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX> operation to proceed as soon as possible. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mihdhar</ENAMEX> reportedly
                told his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cousin</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer of 2001</TIMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> was reputed to have
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">remarked</ENAMEX>, "I will make it happen even if I do it by myself."
            
            According to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> had been urging him to advance the date of the attacks.
                In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>, for instance, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> remembers <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> pushing him to launch the attacks
                amid the controversy after then-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli</ENAMEX> opposition <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">party leader</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ariel Sharon</ENAMEX>'s visit
                to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Temple Mount</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jerusalem</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> claims <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> told him it would be enough
                for the hijackers simply to down <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX> rather than crash them into specific
                targets. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> says he resisted the pressure.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> claims to have faced similar pressure twice more in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>. According to him, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bin</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ladin</ENAMEX> wanted the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX> carried out on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 12, 2001</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven months</TIMEX> to the day
                after the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cole</ENAMEX> bombing. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> adds that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX> attacks had originally been
                envisioned for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 2001</TIMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> time he was urged to launch the attacks early
                was in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 2001</TIMEX>, supposedly after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> learned from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> that
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sharon</ENAMEX> would be visiting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>. On both occasions KSM resisted, asserting
                that the hijacking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> were not ready. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> pressed particularly strongly for
                the latter date in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> letters stressing the need to attack early. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> letter
                reportedly was delivered by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son-in-law</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aws al Madani</ENAMEX>.
            
            Other evidence corroborates <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX>'s account. For instance, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mihdhar</ENAMEX> told his <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cousin</ENAMEX> that
                the attacks were to happen in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX>, but were postponed twice, <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July</TIMEX>, then to
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September</TIMEX>. Moreover, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> hijacker remembers a general warning being issued
                in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camps</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early August</TIMEX>, just like the warnings issued <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX> before the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cole</ENAMEX> bombing and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten days</TIMEX> before the eventual 9/11 attacks. During
                the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">midsummer</TIMEX> alert, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> dispersed with their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>, security was
                increased, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> disappeared for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about 30 days</TIMEX>, until the alert was
                    canceled.
            
            While the details of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX> were strictly compartmented, by the time of the
                alert, word had begun to spread that an attack against the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> was coming.
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> notes that it was generally well known by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer of 2001</TIMEX> that he was
                planning some kind of operation against the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. Many were even aware that
                he had been preparing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX> to go to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, leading some to
                conclude that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> was planning a nearterm attack on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> soil. Moreover, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bin</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ladin</ENAMEX> had made several remarks that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> hinting at an upcoming attack and
                generating rumors throughout the worldwide jihadist community. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> routinely
                told important <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> to expect significant attacks against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> interests soon
                and, during a speech at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Faruq</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camp</ENAMEX>, exhorted trainees to pray for the success
                of an attack involving <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> martyrs. Others have confirmed hearing indications of an
                impending attack and have verified that such news, albeit without specific details,
                had spread across <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>.
            
            Although <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>'s top priority apparently was to attack the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, others
                had a different view. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Taliban</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> put their main emphasis on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX>'s
                military offensive against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern Alliance</ENAMEX>, an offensive that ordinarily would
                begin in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late spring</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX>. They certainly hoped that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX>'s offensive
                would finally finish off their old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enemies</ENAMEX>, driving them from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>. From the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX>'s perspective, an attack against the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> might be
                counterproductive. It might draw the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> into the war against them, just when
                final victory seemed within their grasp.
            
            There is evidence that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mullah Omar</ENAMEX> initially opposed a major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> operation
                directly against the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>. Furthermore, by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July</TIMEX>, with word
                spreading of a coming attack, a schism emerged among the senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qaeda</ENAMEX>. Several senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> reportedly agreed with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mullah Omar</ENAMEX>. Those who
                reportedly sided with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> included <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atef, Sulayman Abu Ghayth</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX>. But
                those said to have opposed him were weighty figures in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>-including
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abu Hafs</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mauritanian</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sheikh Saeed al Masri</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sayf al Adl</ENAMEX>. One senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Qaeda</ENAMEX> operative claims to recall <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> arguing that attacks against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX> needed to be carried out immediately to support insurgency in the
                Israeli-occupied territories and protest the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arabia</ENAMEX>. Beyond these rhetorical appeals, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> also reportedly thought an attack
                against the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> would benefit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> by attracting more suicide
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">operatives</ENAMEX>, eliciting greater donations, and increasing the number of sympathizers
                willing to provide logistical assistance.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mullah</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Omar</ENAMEX> is reported to have opposed this course of action for ideological reasons
                rather than out of fear of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> retaliation. He is said to have preferred for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qaeda</ENAMEX> to attack <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX>, not necessarily the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> contends that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Omar</ENAMEX>
                faced pressure from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pakistani</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> to keep <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> from engaging in
                operations outside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Qaeda</ENAMEX>'s chief financial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sheikh Saeed</ENAMEX>,
                argued that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> should defer to theTaliban's wishes. Another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> says that
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sheikh Saeed</ENAMEX> opposed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX>, both out of deference to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Omar</ENAMEX> and because he
                feared the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> response to an attack. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abu Hafs</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mauritanian</ENAMEX> reportedly even
                wrote <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> a message basing opposition to the attacks on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qur'an</ENAMEX>.
            
            According to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late August</TIMEX>, when the operation was fully planned, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>
                formally notified the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda Shura Council</ENAMEX> that a major attack against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX> would take place in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the coming weeks</TIMEX>. When some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">council</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> objected, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bin</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ladin</ENAMEX> countered that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mullah Omar</ENAMEX> lacked authority to prevent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> from
                conducting jihad outside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>. Though most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shura Council</ENAMEX> reportedly
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">disagreed</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> persisted. The attacks went forward.
            
            The story of dissension within <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> regarding the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX> attacks is probably
                incomplete. The information on which the account is based comes from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> who
                were not privy to the full scope of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">andTaliban</ENAMEX> planning. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> and
                Atef, however, probably would have known, at least, that 
            
                The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">general</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Taliban</ENAMEX> offensive against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern Alliance</ENAMEX> would rely on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al</ENAMEX>
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qaeda</ENAMEX> military support.
                Another significant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> operation was making progress during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX>-a
                    plot to assassinate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern Alliance</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ahmed Shah Massoud</ENAMEX>. The
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">operatives</ENAMEX>, disguised as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalists</ENAMEX>, were in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Massoud</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camp</ENAMEX> and prepared to
                    kill him sometime in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August</TIMEX>. Their appointment to see him was delayed.
                
            
            But on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 9</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Massoud</ENAMEX> assassination took place. The delayedTaliban
                offensive against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern Alliance</ENAMEX> was apparently coordinated to begin as soon
                as he was killed, and it got under way on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 10</TIMEX>.
            
            As they deliberated earlier in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atef</ENAMEX> would likely have
                remembered that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mullah Omar</ENAMEX> was dependent on them for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Massoud</ENAMEX> assassination and
                for vital support in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Taliban</ENAMEX> military operations. KSM remembers Atef telling him
                that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> had an agreement with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX> to eliminate <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Massoud</ENAMEX>, after which
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX> would begin an offensive to take over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atef</ENAMEX> hoped <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Massoud</ENAMEX>'s
                death would also appease the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX> when the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX> attacks happened. There are also
                some scant indications that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Omar</ENAMEX> may have been reconciled to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX> attacks by the
                time they occurred.
            
            Moving to <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Departure Positions</ENAMEX>
            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the days</TIMEX> just before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9/11</TIMEX>, the hijackers returned leftover funds to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> and
                assembled in their departure <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>. They sent the excess funds by wire transfer to
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hawsawi</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAE</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $26,000</NUMEX> altogether.
            
            The hijackers targeting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Airlines</ENAMEX> Flight <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">77</NUMEX>, to depart from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dulles</ENAMEX>, migrated
                from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Jersey</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Laurel</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maryland</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 20 miles</NUMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">D.C.</ENAMEX> They
                stayed in a motel during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first week</TIMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September</TIMEX> and spent time working out at a
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gym</ENAMEX>. On <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the final night</TIMEX> before the attacks, they lodged at a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Herndon</ENAMEX>,
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX>, close to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX>.
            
            Further north, the hijackers targeting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Airlines</ENAMEX> Flight <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">93</NUMEX>, to depart from
                <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Newark</ENAMEX>, gathered in that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> from their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 7</TIMEX>. Just after
                <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midnight</TIMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 8-9</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jarrah</ENAMEX> received a speeding ticket in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maryland</ENAMEX> as he
                headed north on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">I-95</ENAMEX>. He joined the rest of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> at their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX>.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> was still busy coordinating the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">teams</ENAMEX>. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 7</TIMEX>, he flew from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fort</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lauderdale</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baltimore</ENAMEX>, presumably to meet with the Flight <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">77</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Laurel</ENAMEX>. On
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 9</TIMEX>, he flew from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baltimore</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX>. By then, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shehhi</ENAMEX> had arrived there,
                and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> was seen with him at his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX>. The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next day</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> picked up Omari at
                another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX>, and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> drove to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portland</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maine</ENAMEX>, for reasons that remain
                unknown. In the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early morning hours</TIMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 11</TIMEX>, they boarded a commuter flight
                to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX> to connect to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Airlines</ENAMEX> Flight <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> spent their last night
                pursuing ordinary activities: making ATM withdrawals, eating <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pizza</ENAMEX>, and shopping at
                a convenience <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">store</ENAMEX>. Their <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fellow</ENAMEX> hijackers for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Flight 11</ENAMEX> stayed together in a
                hotel in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Newton</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Massachusetts</ENAMEX>, just outside of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX>.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shehhi</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> targeting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Airlines</ENAMEX> Flight 175 from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Logan Airport</ENAMEX> spent
                their <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">last hours</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotels</ENAMEX>.
            
            The plan that started with a proposal by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> had evolved to overcome numerous
                obstacles. Now <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> waited in nondescript hotel <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> to board <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> flights the
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX>.
