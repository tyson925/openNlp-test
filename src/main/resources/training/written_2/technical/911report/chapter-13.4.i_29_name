                Murad claims he was thinking of hijacking a commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> to do it, saying the

                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arabia</ENAMEX>, zakat is broader and more pervasive than Western ideas of charity, in that
                it functions not only as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">charity</ENAMEX> but also as social welfare, educational assistance,
                foreign aid, a form of income tax, and a source of political influence.
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">124</NUMEX>. A hawala, at least in the "pure" form, transfers value without the use of a
                negotiable instrument or other commonly recognized method for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> of money.
                For example, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">resident</ENAMEX> who wanted to send money to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> in another
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>, would give her money, in dollars, to a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>-based
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hawaladar</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hawaladar</ENAMEX> would then contact his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterpart</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>, giving
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pakistani</ENAMEX> hawaladar the particulars of the transaction, such as the amount of
                money, the code, and perhaps the identity of the recipient. The ultimate recipient
                in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> would then go to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pakistani</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hawaladar</ENAMEX> and receive his money, in
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rupees</ENAMEX>, from whatever money the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pakistani</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hawaladar</ENAMEX> has on hand. As far as the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sender</ENAMEX> and ultimate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipient</ENAMEX> are concerned, the transaction is then complete. The
                <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hawaladars</ENAMEX> would have a variety of mechanisms to settle their debt, either
                through offsetting transactions (e.g., someone in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> sending money to the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX> using the same <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> hawaladars), a periodic settling wire transfer from

                transaction, such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hawaladar</ENAMEX> paying a debt or an invoice, in dollars,
                that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pakistani</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hawaladar</ENAMEX> owes in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hawalas</ENAMEX> typically do not

                revealed that the trading had no connection with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX>. A single <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>-based

                investigations. Moreover, the legal bar to sharing information was often
                exaggerated. Only information actually presented to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">grand jury</ENAMEX> could not be

                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelligence Surveillance Act</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FISA</ENAMEX>) Process," <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 18, 2001</TIMEX>.
            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 2001</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Accounting Office</ENAMEX> criticized the way the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX> procedures
                were being applied and criticized <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OIPR</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> for not complying with the
                information-sharing requirements of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX> procedures. This was the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> report
                in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">as many years</TIMEX> by a government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> indicating that the procedures were not
                working as planned. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 2000</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 2000</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 2001</TIMEX>, proposals for
                reform to the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX> procedures were put forth by senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOJ</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>. None resulted
                in reform. One impediment was that the respective <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOJ</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">components</ENAMEX> could not agree on
                all the proposed reforms. A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> impediment was a concern that such reforms would
                require a challenge to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FISA Court</ENAMEX>'s position on the matter. This was considered
                risky because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FISA Court of Review</ENAMEX> had never convened, and one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judges</ENAMEX> had
                previously voiced skepticism regarding the constitutionality of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FISA</ENAMEX> statute.
                Deputy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Attorney General</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry Thompson</ENAMEX> did ask the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> to accept the modifications
                described in the text, which were distributed as part of his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 2001</TIMEX> memorandum
                reaffirming the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX> procedures. See <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOJ</ENAMEX> memo, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thompson</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Criminal Division</ENAMEX>,

            Bayoumi was once the subject of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> counterterrorism investigation, prompted by

                he was in such a hurry to complete the rental transaction that he signed the

                apartment when one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guests</ENAMEX> created an awkward social circumstance by bringing
                his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX>; Bayoumi solved the problem by having the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> stay with his own
