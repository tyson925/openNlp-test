            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PREPAREDNESS AS OF SEPTEMBER 11</ENAMEX>
            Emergency response is a product of preparedness. On <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 11</TIMEX>,
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>, the last best hope for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> working in or visiting the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Trade Center</ENAMEX> rested not with national policymakers but with private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX> and
                local public <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">servants</ENAMEX>, especially the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> responders: fire, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX>, emergency
                medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">service</ENAMEX>, and building safety <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX>.
            Building Preparedness
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Trade Center</ENAMEX>.
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Trade Center</ENAMEX> (WTC) <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> was built for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Port Authority of New York</ENAMEX> and
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Jersey</ENAMEX>. Construction began in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1966</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tenants</ENAMEX> began to occupy its space in
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1970</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Twin Towers</ENAMEX> came to occupy a unique and symbolic place in the culture of
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York City</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>.
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTC</ENAMEX> actually consisted of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>, including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX>, spread across <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>
                acres of land. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> were connected by an underground <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mall</ENAMEX> (the concourse).
                The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Twin Towers</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTC</ENAMEX>, or the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North Tower</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTC</ENAMEX>, or the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">South Tower</ENAMEX>) were the
                signature structures, containing <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10.4 million square feet</NUMEX> of office space. Both
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">towers</ENAMEX> had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">110</NUMEX> stories, were <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 1,350 feet</NUMEX> high, and were square; each wall
                measured <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">208</NUMEX> feet in length. On any given workday, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to 50,000</NUMEX> office workers
                occupied the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">towers</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> passed through the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>.
            
            Each <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> contained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stairwells</ENAMEX>, which ran essentially from top to
                bottom, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">99</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">elevators</ENAMEX>. Generally, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">elevators originating</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lobby</ENAMEX> ran to "sky
                lobbies" on higher floors, where additional <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">elevators</ENAMEX> carried <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> to the tops
                of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Stairwells A</ENAMEX> and C ran from the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">110th</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX> to the raised mezzanine level of the
                lobby. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stairwell</ENAMEX> B ran from the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">107th</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX> to level <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">B6</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floors</ENAMEX> below ground,
                and was accessible from the West Street <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lobby</ENAMEX> level, which was one floor below the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mezzanine</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">All three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stairwells</ENAMEX> ran essentially straight up and down, except for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two</TIMEX>
                deviations in stairwells A and C where the staircase jutted out toward the perimeter
                of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>. On the upper and lower boundaries of these deviations were transfer
                hallways contained within the stairwell proper. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hallway</ENAMEX> contained smoke doors
                to prevent smoke from rising from lower to upper portions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>; they were
                kept closed but not locked. Doors leading from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tenant</ENAMEX> space into the stairwells were
                never kept locked; reentry from the stairwells was generally possible on at least
                every <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX>.
            
            Doors leading to the roof were locked. There was no rooftop evacuation plan. The
                roofs of both the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North Tower</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">South Tower</ENAMEX> were sloped and cluttered surfaces
                with radiation hazards, making them impractical for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">helicopter</ENAMEX> landings and as
                staging areas for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX>. Although the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">South Tower roof</ENAMEX> had a helipad, it did not
                meet <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Aviation Administration</ENAMEX> guidelines.
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1993 Terrorist Bombing</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTC</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Port Authority</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Response</ENAMEX>. Unlike most
                of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York City</ENAMEX> and specifically the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Trade Center</ENAMEX> had been the
                target of terrorist attacks before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9/11</TIMEX>. At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12:18 P.M.</TIMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February 26, 1993</TIMEX>, a
                <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,500-pound</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bomb</ENAMEX> stashed in a rental <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">van</ENAMEX> was detonated on a parking <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garage</ENAMEX> ramp
                beneath theTwinTowers. The explosion killed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, injured <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 1,000</NUMEX> more,
                and exposed vulnerabilities in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Trade Center</ENAMEX>'s and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>'s emergency
                    preparedness.
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">towers</ENAMEX> lost power and communications capability. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Generators</ENAMEX> had to be shut down
                to ensure safety, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">elevators</ENAMEX> stopped. The public-address system and emergency
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lighting</ENAMEX> systems failed. The unlit stairwells filled with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">smoke</ENAMEX> and were so dark as
                to be impassable. Rescue efforts by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fire Department of New York</ENAMEX> (FDNY) were
                hampered by the inability of its radios to function in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> as large as the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Twin Towers</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">911</NUMEX> emergency call system was overwhelmed. The general evacuation
                of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">towers</ENAMEX>' occupants via the stairwells took <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">more than four hours</TIMEX>.
            
            Several small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who were physically unable to descend the stairs were
                evacuated from the roof of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">South Tower</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Police Department</ENAMEX> (NYPD)
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">helicopters</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">At least one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> was lifted from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North Tower</ENAMEX> roof by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYPD</ENAMEX> in
                a dangerous <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">helicopter</ENAMEX> rappel operation<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">- 15 hours</TIMEX> after the bombing. General
                knowledge that these air rescues had occurred appears to have left a number of
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> who worked in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Twin Towers</ENAMEX> with the false impression that helicopter
                rescues were part of the WTC evacuation plan and that rescue from the roof was a
                viable, if not favored, option for those who worked on upper floors. Although they
                were considered after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">helicopter</ENAMEX> evacuations in fact were not incorporated
                into the WTC fire safety plan.
            
            To address the problems encountered during the response to the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX> bombing, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Port</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Authority</ENAMEX> spent <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">an initial $100 million</NUMEX> to make physical, structural, and
                technological improvements to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTC</ENAMEX>, as well as to enhance its fire safety plan
                and reorganize and bolster its fire safety and security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staffs</ENAMEX>.
            
            Substantial enhancements were made to power sources and exits. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fluorescent</ENAMEX> signs and
                markings were added in and near stairwells. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Port Authority</ENAMEX> also installed a
                sophisticated computerized fire alarm system with redundant electronics and control
                panels, and state-of-the-art fire command <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stations</ENAMEX> were placed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lobby</ENAMEX> of each
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tower</ENAMEX>.
            
            To manage fire emergency preparedness and operations, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Port Authority</ENAMEX> created the
                dedicated position of fire safety <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> supervised a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> of deputy
                fire safety <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX>, one of whom was on duty at the fire command <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX> in the
                lobby of each <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> at all times. He or she would be responsible for communicating
                with building occupants during an emergency.
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Port Authority</ENAMEX> also sought to prepare <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> better for future emergencies.
                Deputy fire safety <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX> conducted fire drills at least twice <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX>, with
                advance notice to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tenants</ENAMEX>." Fire safety <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX>"were selected from among civilian
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> on each <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX> and consisted of a fire warden, deputy fire <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wardens</ENAMEX>, and
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">searchers</ENAMEX>. The standard procedure for fire drills was for fire <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wardens</ENAMEX> to lead
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">co-workers</ENAMEX> in their respective areas to the center of the floor, where they would
                use the emergency intercom phone to obtain specific information on how to proceed.
                Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> have told us that their evacuation on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 11</TIMEX> was greatly aided
                by changes and training implemented by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Port Authority</ENAMEX> in response to the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>
                    bombing.
            
            But during these drills, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> were not directed into the stairwells, or provided
                with information about their configuration and about the existence of transfer
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hallways</ENAMEX> and smoke doors. Neither full nor partial evacuation drills were held.
                Moreover, participation in drills that were held varied greatly from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tenant</ENAMEX> to
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tenant</ENAMEX>. In general, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> were never told not to evacuate up. The standard fire
                drill announcement advised <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> that in the event of an actual emergency,
                they would be directed to descend to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floors</ENAMEX> below the fire. Most
                civilians recall simply being taught to await the instructions that would be
                provided at the time of an emergency. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Civilians</ENAMEX> were not informed that rooftop
                evacuations were not part of the evacuation plan, or that doors to the roof were
                kept locked. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Port Authority</ENAMEX> acknowledges that it had no protocol for rescuing
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> trapped <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">above</NUMEX> a fire in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">towers</ENAMEX>.
            
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Six weeks</TIMEX> before the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 11</TIMEX> attacks, control of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTC</ENAMEX> was transferred by net
                lease to a private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">developer</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Silverstein Properties</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Select Port Authority</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> were designated to assist with the transition. Others remained on-site but
                were no longer part of the official <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">command</ENAMEX>. However, on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 11</TIMEX>, most
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Port Authority World Trade Department</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>-including those not on the
                designated "transition <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX>"- reported to their regular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stations</ENAMEX> to provide
                assistance throughout <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX>. Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Silverstein Properties</ENAMEX> was in charge of
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTC</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 11</TIMEX>, the WTC fire safety plan remained essentially the
                    same.
            
            Preparedness of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Responders</ENAMEX>
            On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9/11</TIMEX>, the principal <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> responders were from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fire Department of New York</ENAMEX>,
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Police Department</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Port Authority Police Department</ENAMEX> (PAPD), and the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mayor</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office of Emergency Management</ENAMEX> (OEM).
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Port Authority Police Department</ENAMEX>. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 11, 2001</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Port Authority of New</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">York</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Jersey</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Police Department</ENAMEX> consisted of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,331</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX>, many of whom were
                trained in fire suppression methods as well as in law enforcement. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAPD</ENAMEX> was led
                by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">superintendent</ENAMEX>. There was a separate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAPD</ENAMEX> command for each of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Port</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Authority's</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX>, including the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Trade Center</ENAMEX>.
            
            Most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Port Authority</ENAMEX> police commands used ultra-high-frequency radios. Although all
                the radios were capable of using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX>, most PAPD <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> used one
                local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX>. The local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> were low-wattage and worked only in the immediate
                vicinity of that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">command</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAPD</ENAMEX> also had an agencywide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX>, but not all
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">commands</ENAMEX> could access it.
            
            As of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 11</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Port Authority</ENAMEX> lacked any standard operating procedures to
                govern how <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> from multiple commands would respond to and then be staged and
                utilized at a major incident at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTC</ENAMEX>. In particular, there were no standard
                operating procedures covering how different commands should communicate via radio
                during such an incident.
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Police Department</ENAMEX>.
            
            The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40,000</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> NYPD was headed by a police <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commissioner</ENAMEX>, whose duties were not
                primarily operational but who retained operational authority. Much of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYPD</ENAMEX>'s
                operational activities were run by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX>. In the event of a major
                emergency, a leading role would be played by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Special Operations Division</ENAMEX>. This
                division included the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aviation Unit</ENAMEX>, which provided <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">helicopters</ENAMEX> for surveys and
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rescues</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Emergency Service</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Unit</ENAMEX> (ESU), which carried out specialized rescue
                missions. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYPD</ENAMEX> had specific and detailed standard operating procedures for the
                dispatch of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> to an incident, depending on the incident's magnitude.
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYPD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">precincts</ENAMEX> were divided into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> different radio zones, with a central radio
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dispatcher</ENAMEX> assigned to each. In addition, there were several radio <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> for
                citywide operations. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Officers</ENAMEX> had portable radios with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> or more available
                channels, so that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> could respond outside his or her precinct. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESU</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> also
                had these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> but at an operation would use a separate point-to-point channel
                (which was not monitored by a dispatcher)<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.17</NUMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYPD</ENAMEX> also supervised the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>'s 911
                emergency call system. Its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 1,200</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operators</ENAMEX>, radio <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dispatchers</ENAMEX>, and
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supervisors</ENAMEX> were civilian <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYPD</ENAMEX>. They were trained in the rudiments
                of emergency response. When a <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">911</ENAMEX> call concerned a fire, it was transferred to FDNY
                    dispatch.
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fire Department of New York</ENAMEX>.
            
            The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11,000</NUMEX>-member <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX> was headed by a fire <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commissioner</ENAMEX> who, unlike the police
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commissioner</ENAMEX>, lacked operational authority. Operations were headed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> of
                department- the sole five-star <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX>.
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX> was organized in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> separate geographic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">divisions</ENAMEX>. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX> was
                further divided into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between four</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> battalions. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">battalion</ENAMEX> contained
                typically <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between three and four</NUMEX> engine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two to four</NUMEX> ladder <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>.
                In total, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX> had 205 engine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">133</NUMEX> ladder <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>. On-duty ladder
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> consisted of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">captain</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lieutenant</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">firefighters</ENAMEX>; on-duty engine
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> consisted of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">captain</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lieutenant</ENAMEX> and normally <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">firefighters</ENAMEX>.
                Ladder <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>' primary function was to conduct rescues; engine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> focused
                on extinguishing fires.
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Specialized Operations Command</ENAMEX> (SOC) contained a limited number of units
                that were of particular importance in responding to a terrorist attack or other
                major incident. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> rescue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">squad companies</ENAMEX>
                performed specialized and highly risky rescue operations.
            
            The logistics of fire operations were directed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fire Dispatch Operations Division</ENAMEX>,
                which had a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> in each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> boroughs. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">All 911</NUMEX> calls concerning fire
                emergencies were transferred to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX> dispatch.
            
            As of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 11</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chiefs</ENAMEX> responding to a fire used analog,
                point-to-point radios that had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> normal operating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX>. Typically, the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> would operate on the same tactical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX>, which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chiefs</ENAMEX> on the scene
                would monitor and use to communicate with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">firefighters</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chiefs</ENAMEX> at a fire
                operation also would use a separate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">command channel</ENAMEX>. Because these point-to-point
                radios had weak signal strength, communications on them could be heard only by other
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> in the immediate vicinity. In addition, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX> had a dispatch
                frequency for each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> boroughs; these were not point-to-point <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> and
                could be monitored from around the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>.
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX>'s radios performed poorly during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1993</TIMEX> WTC bombing for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> reasons.
                First, the radios signals often did not succeed in penetrating the numerous steel
                and concrete floors that separated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> attempting to communicate; and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>,
                so many different <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> were attempting to use the same point-to-point channel
                that communications became unintelligible.
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Port Authority</ENAMEX> installed, at its own expense, a repeater system in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX> to
                greatly enhance FDNY radio communications in the difficult high-rise environment of
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Twin Towers</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Port Authority</ENAMEX> recommended leaving the repeater system on at
                <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all</NUMEX> times. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX> requested, however, that the repeater be turned on only when it
                was actually needed because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> could cause interference with other FDNY
                operations in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lower Manhattan</ENAMEX>. The repeater system was installed at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Port</ENAMEX>
                Authority police <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">desk</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTC</ENAMEX>, to be activated by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Port Authority</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> responding to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> so requested. However, in
                the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">spring of 2000</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX> asked that an activation console for the repeater system
                be placed instead in the lobby fire safety desk of each of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">towers</ENAMEX>, making FDNY
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> entirely responsible for its activation. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Port Authority</ENAMEX> complied.
            
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Between 1998 and 2000</TIMEX>, fewer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> died from fires in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York City</ENAMEX> than in any
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three-year</TIMEX> period since accurate measurements began in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1946</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Firefighter</ENAMEX> deaths-a
                total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> during the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">1990s</NUMEX>-compared favorably with the most tranquil periods in
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX>'s history.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Office</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Emergency Management and Interagency Preparedness</ENAMEX>.
            
            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mayor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rudolph Giuliani</ENAMEX> created the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mayor</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office of Emergency Management</ENAMEX>,
                which had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> basic functions. First, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OEM</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Watch Command</ENAMEX> was to monitor the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>'s key communications <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX>-including radio frequencies of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX> dispatch and
                the NYPD-and other data. A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> purpose of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OEM</ENAMEX> was to improve <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York City</ENAMEX>'s
                response to major incidents, including terrorist attacks, by planning and conducting
                exercises and drills that would involve multiple city <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>, particularly the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYPD</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OEM</ENAMEX> would play a crucial role in managing the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>'s
                overall response to an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The World Trade Center Radio Repeater System Rendering</ENAMEX> by
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marco Crupi</ENAMEX> incident. After <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OEM</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Emergency Operations Center</ENAMEX> was activated,
                designated liaisons from relevant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>, as well as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mayor</ENAMEX> and his or her
                senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>, would respond there. In addition, an OEM field responder would be sent
                to the scene to ensure that the response was coordinated.
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OEM</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX> was located at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7WTC</TIMEX>. Some questioned locating it both so close
                to a previous terrorist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX> and on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">23rd</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX> of a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> (difficult to
                access should <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">elevators</ENAMEX> become inoperable). There was no backup <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">site</ENAMEX>.
            
            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 2001</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mayor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giuliani</ENAMEX> updated a directive titled <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">"Direction and Control of</ENAMEX>
                Emergencies in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">City of New York</ENAMEX>." Its purpose was to eliminate "potential
                conflict among responding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> which may have areas of overlapping expertise and
                responsibility." The directive sought to accomplish this objective by designating,
                for different types of emergencies, an appropriate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> as "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Incident Commander</ENAMEX>."
                This Incident <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Commander</ENAMEX> would be "responsible for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">City</ENAMEX>'s
                response to the emergency," while the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OEM</ENAMEX> was "designated the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">'On Scene Interagency</ENAMEX>
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Coordinator</ENAMEX>.'"
            
            Nevertheless, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYPD</ENAMEX> each considered itself operationally autonomous. As
                of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 11</TIMEX>, they were not prepared to comprehensively coordinate their efforts
                in responding to a major incident. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OEM</ENAMEX> had not overcome this problem.
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SEPTEMBER 11, 2001</TIMEX>
            As we turn to the events of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 11</TIMEX>, we are mindful of the unfair perspective
                afforded by hindsight. Nevertheless, we will try to describe what happened in the
                following <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">102 minutes</TIMEX>:
            
                the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">17 minutes</TIMEX> from the crash of the hijacked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Airlines</ENAMEX> Flight <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> into
                    <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Trade Center</ENAMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North Tower</ENAMEX>) at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:46</TIMEX> until the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">South Tower</ENAMEX> was hit
                the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">56 minutes</TIMEX> from the crash of the hijacked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Airlines</ENAMEX> Flight 175 into
                    <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Trade Center</ENAMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">South Tower</ENAMEX>) at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:03</TIMEX> until the collapse of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South</ENAMEX>
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tower</ENAMEX>
                the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">29 minutes</TIMEX> from the collapse of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">South Tower</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:59</TIMEX> until the collapse
                    of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North Tower</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10:28 From 8:46 until 9:03 A.M.</TIMEX>
            
            At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:46:40</TIMEX>, the hijacked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Airlines</ENAMEX> Flight <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> flew into the upper portion of
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North Tower</ENAMEX>, cutting through floors <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">93 to 99</TIMEX>. Evidence suggests that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX>
                of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>'s stairwells became impassable from the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">92nd</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX> up. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Hundreds</NUMEX> of
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> were killed instantly by the impact. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Hundreds</NUMEX> more remained alive but
                    trapped.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Civilians</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fire Safety Personnel</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">911</NUMEX> Calls
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North Tower</ENAMEX>.
            
            A jet <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fuel</ENAMEX> fireball erupted upon impact and shot down <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">elevators</ENAMEX>.
                The fireball exploded onto numerous lower floors, including <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 77th and 22nd</TIMEX>; the
                West Street <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lobby</ENAMEX> level; and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the B4</TIMEX> level, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> stories below ground. The burning
                jet <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fuel</ENAMEX> immediately created thick, black smoke that enveloped the upper floors and
                <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">roof of the North Tower</ENAMEX>. The roof of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">South Tower</ENAMEX> was also engulfed in smoke
                because of prevailing light winds from the northwest.
            
            Within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York City</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">911</ENAMEX> system was flooded with eyewitness accounts of
                the event. Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">callers</ENAMEX> correctly identified the target of the attack. Some
                identified the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> as a commercial airliner.
            
            The first response came from private <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firms</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>-the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">companies</ENAMEX>
                in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>. Everything that would happen to them during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the next few minutes</TIMEX>
                would turn on their circumstances and their preparedness, assisted by building
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> on-site.
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Hundreds</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> trapped on or above the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">92nd</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX> gathered in large and small
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">groups</ENAMEX>, primarily between the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">103rd</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">106th</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floors</ENAMEX>. A large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> was reported on
                the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">92nd</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX>, technically below the impact but unable to descend. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Civilians</ENAMEX> were
                also trapped in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">elevators</ENAMEX>. Other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> below the impact zone-mostly on floors in
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 70s and 80s</TIMEX>, but also on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least the 47th</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22nd</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floors</ENAMEX>-were either trapped
                or waiting for assistance.
            
            It is unclear when the first full building evacuation order was attempted over the
                public-address system. The deputy fire safety <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lobby</ENAMEX>, while
                immediately aware that a major incident had occurred, did not know for approximately
                <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">ten minutes</TIMEX> that a commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">jet</ENAMEX> had directly hit the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>. Following protocol,
                he initially gave announcements to those <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floors</ENAMEX> that had generated computerized
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">alarms</ENAMEX>, advising those <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tenants</ENAMEX> to descend to points of safety-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floors</ENAMEX>
                below the smoke or fire-and to wait there for further instructions. The deputy fire
                safety <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> has told us that he began instructing a full evacuation within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about</TIMEX>
                <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">ten minutes</TIMEX> of the explosion. But the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> FDNY <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chiefs</ENAMEX> to arrive in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lobby</ENAMEX> were
                advised by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Port Authority</ENAMEX> fire safety <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX>-who had reported to the lobby
                although he was no longer the designated fire safety <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX>-that the full building
                evacuation announcement had been made within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one minute</TIMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> being
                    hit.
            
            Because of damage to building systems caused by the impact of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX>,
                public-address announcements were not heard in many locations. For the same reason,
                many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> may have been unable to use the emergency intercom phones, as they
                had been advised to do in fire drills. Many called 911.
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">911</ENAMEX> system was not equipped to handle the enormous volume of calls it received.
                Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">callers</ENAMEX> were unable to connect with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">911</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operators</ENAMEX>, receiving an "all circuits
                busy"message. Standard operating procedure was for calls relating to fire
                emergencies to be transferred from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">911</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operators</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX> dispatch <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operators</ENAMEX> in the
                appropriate <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">borough</ENAMEX> (in this case, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manhattan</ENAMEX>). Transfers were often plagued by
                delays and were in some cases unsuccessful. Many calls were also prematurely
                    disconnected.
            
            The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">911</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operators</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dispatchers</ENAMEX> had no information about either the location
                or the magnitude of the impact zone and were therefore unable to provide information
                as fundamental as whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">callers</ENAMEX> were above or below the fire. Because the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operators</ENAMEX> were not informed of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYPD Aviation</ENAMEX>'s determination of the impossibility of
                rooftop rescues from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Twin Towers</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that day</TIMEX>, they could not knowledgeably
                answer when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">callers</ENAMEX> asked whether to go up or down. In most instances, therefore,
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operators</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dispatchers</ENAMEX> relied on standard operating procedures for
                high-rise fires-that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> should stay low, remain where they are, and wait for
                emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> to reach them. This advice was given to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">callers</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tower</ENAMEX> for locations both above and below the impact zone. Fire <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chiefs</ENAMEX> told us that
                the evacuation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tens of thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> from skyscrapers can create many new
                problems, especially for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> who are disabled or in poor health. Many of the
                injuries after the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX> bombing occurred during the evacuation.
            
            Although the guidance to stay in place may seem understandable in cases of
                conventional high-rise fires, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chiefs</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North Tower</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lobby</ENAMEX> determined at
                once that all building occupants should attempt to evacuate immediately. By <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:57</TIMEX>,
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chiefs</ENAMEX> had instructed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAPD</ENAMEX> and building <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> to evacuate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tower</ENAMEX> as well, because of the magnitude of the damage caused by the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX>'s
                    impact.
            
            These critical decisions were not conveyed to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">911</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operators</ENAMEX> or to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dispatchers</ENAMEX>.
                Departing from protocol, a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operators</ENAMEX> told <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">callers</ENAMEX> that they could break
                windows, and several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operators</ENAMEX> advised <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">callers</ENAMEX> to evacuate if they could.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Civilians</ENAMEX> who called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Port Authority</ENAMEX> police <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">desk</ENAMEX> located at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTC</ENAMEX> were advised to
                leave if they could.
            
            Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> who were not obstructed from proceeding began evacuating without
                waiting for instructions over the intercom system. Some remained to wait for help,
                as advised by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">911</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operators</ENAMEX>. Others simply continued to work or delayed to collect
                personal items, but in many cases were urged to leave by others. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Port Authority</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilian employees</ENAMEX> remained on various upper floors to help <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> who were
                trapped and to assist in the evacuation.
            
            While evacuating, some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> had trouble reaching the exits because of damage
                caused by the impact. Some were confused by deviations in the increasingly crowded
                stairwells, and impeded by doors that appeared to be locked but actually were jammed
                by debris or shifting that resulted from the impact of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX>. Despite these
                obstacles, the evacuation was relatively calm and orderly.
            
            Within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">ten minutes</TIMEX> of impact, smoke was beginning to rise to the upper floors in
                debilitating volumes and isolated fires were reported, although there were some
                pockets of refuge. Faced with insufferable heat, smoke, and fire, and with no
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prospect</ENAMEX> for relief, some jumped or fell from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South Tower</ENAMEX>.
            
            Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">South Tower</ENAMEX> were initially unaware of what had happened in the
                other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX>. Some believed an incident had occurred in their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>; others were
                aware that a major explosion had occurred on the upper floors of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North Tower</ENAMEX>.
                Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> decided to leave, and some were advised to do so by fire <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wardens</ENAMEX>. In
                addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morgan Stanley</ENAMEX>, which occupied <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floors</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">South Tower</ENAMEX>,
                evacuated its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> by the decision of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>.
            
            Consistent with protocol, at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:49</TIMEX> the deputy fire safety <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South Tower</ENAMEX>
                told his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterpart</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North Tower</ENAMEX> that he would wait to hear from "the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">boss</ENAMEX>
                from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fire Department</ENAMEX> or somebody" before ordering an evacuation.
            
            At about this time, an announcement over the public-address system in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South Tower</ENAMEX>
                stated that the incident had occurred in the other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> and advised <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tenants</ENAMEX>,
                generally, that their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> was safe and that they should remain on or return to
                their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> or floors. A statement from the deputy fire safety <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> informing
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tenants</ENAMEX> that the incident had occurred in the other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> was consistent with
                protocol; the expanded advice did not correspond to any existing written protocol,
                and did not reflect any instruction known to have been given to the deputy fire
                safety <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that day</TIMEX>. We do not know the reason for the announcement, as both
                the deputy fire safety <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> believed to have made it and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of fire
                safety for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex perished</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">South Tower</ENAMEX>'s collapse. Clearly, however,
                the prospect of another <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> hitting the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> was beyond the
                contemplation of anyone giving advice. According to one of the first fire <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chiefs</ENAMEX> to
                arrive, such a scenario was unimaginable, "beyond our consciousness." As a result of
                the announcement, many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> remained on their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floors</ENAMEX>. Others reversed their
                evacuation and went back up.
            
            Similar advice was given in person by security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> in both the groundfloor
                lobby-where a group of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> that had descended by the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">elevators</ENAMEX> was personally
                instructed to go back <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">upstairs</ENAMEX>-and in the upper sky <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lobby</ENAMEX>, where many waited for
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">express</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">elevators</ENAMEX> to take them down. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Security</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> who gave this advice were
                not part of the fire safety <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>.
            
            Several <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">South Tower</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">occupants</ENAMEX> called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Port Authority</ENAMEX> police <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">desk</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTC</ENAMEX>. Some
                were advised to stand by for further instructions; others were strongly advised to
                    leave.
            
            It is not known whether the order by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX> to evacuate the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">South Tower</ENAMEX> was
                received by the deputy fire safety <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> making announcements there. However, at
                <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">approximately 9:02-less than a minute</TIMEX> before the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> was hit-an instruction
                over the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">South Tower</ENAMEX>'s public-address system advised <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX>, generally, that they
                could begin an orderly evacuation if conditions warranted. Like the earlier advice
                to remain in place, it did not correspond to any prewritten emergency
                    instruction.
            
            FDNY Initial Response
            Mobilization.
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX> response began within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five seconds</TIMEX> of the crash. By <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:00</TIMEX>, many senior FDNY
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX>, including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> most highly ranked <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chiefs</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX>, as well
                as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Commissioner</ENAMEX> and many of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">deputies</ENAMEX> and assistants, had begun responding
                from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brooklyn</ENAMEX>. While en route over the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Brooklyn Bridge</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chief</ENAMEX> of
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Department</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chief</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Operations</ENAMEX> had a clear view of the situation on the
                upper floors of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North Tower</ENAMEX>. They determined that because of the fire's
                magnitude and location near the top of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>, their mission would be
                primarily one of rescue. They called for a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX> alarm, which would bring additional
                engine and ladder <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>, as well as for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> more elite rescue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>. The Chief
                of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department</ENAMEX> arrived at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 9:00</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">general FDNY Incident Command</ENAMEX> was transferred
                to his location on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Side</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Highway</ENAMEX>. In all, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX> senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chiefs</ENAMEX> and
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">commissioners</ENAMEX> arrived at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTC</ENAMEX> before <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10:00</TIMEX>.
            
            As of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:00</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> that were dispatched (including senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chiefs</ENAMEX> responding to
                <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX>) included <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 235</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">firefighters</ENAMEX>. These <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> consisted of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX>
                engine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> ladder <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX>'s elite rescue
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX>'s single <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hazmat</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>'s elite <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">squad companies</ENAMEX>,
                and support <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>. In addition, at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:53 nine</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brooklyn</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> were staged on the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brooklyn</ENAMEX> side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brooklyn</ENAMEX>-BatteryTunnel to await possible dispatch orders.
            
            Operations.
            
            A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">battalion chief</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> ladder and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> engine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> arrived at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North Tower</ENAMEX>
                at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">approximately 8:52</TIMEX>. As they entered the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lobby</ENAMEX>, they encountered badly burned
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> who had been caught in the path of the fireball. Floor-to-ceiling windows
                in the northwest corner of the West Street level of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lobby</ENAMEX> had been blown out;
                some large marble tiles had been dislodged from the walls; one entire elevator bank
                was destroyed by the fireball. Lights were functioning, however, and the air was
                clear of smoke.
            
            As the highest-ranking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> on the scene, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">battalion chief</ENAMEX> initially was the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX> incident <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commander</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Minutes</TIMEX> later, the on-duty division <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lower</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manhattan</ENAMEX> arrived and took over. Both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chiefs</ENAMEX> immediately began speaking with the
                former fire safety <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> and other building <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> to learn whether building
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX> were working. They were advised that all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">99</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">elevators</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North Tower</ENAMEX>
                appeared to be out, and there were no assurances that sprinklers or standpipes were
                working on upper floors. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chiefs</ENAMEX> also spoke with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Port Authority</ENAMEX> police <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> and
                an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OEM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX>.
            
            After conferring with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chiefs</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lobby</ENAMEX>, one engine and one ladder company
                began climbing stairwell C at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 8:57</TIMEX>, with the goal of approaching the impact
                zone as scouting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> and reporting back to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chiefs</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lobby</ENAMEX>. The radio
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">channel</ENAMEX> they used was tactical <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. Following FDNY high-rise fire protocols, other
                units did not begin climbing immediately, as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chiefs</ENAMEX> worked to formulate a plan
                before sending them up. Units began mobilizing in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lobby</ENAMEX>, lining up and awaiting
                their marching orders.
            
            Also by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">approximately 8:57</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chiefs</ENAMEX> had asked both building <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Port</ENAMEX>
                Authority police <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> to evacuate the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">South Tower</ENAMEX>, because in their judgment the
                impact of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NorthTower</ENAMEX> made the entire complex unsafe-not because
                of concerns about a possible <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX>.
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chiefs</ENAMEX> in the increasingly crowded <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North Tower</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lobby</ENAMEX> were confronting
                critical choices with little to no information. They had ordered units up the stairs
                to report back on conditions, but did not know what the impact floors were; they did
                not know if any stairwells into the impact zone were clear; and they did not know
                whether <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> for firefighting would be available on the upper floors. They also did
                not know what the fire and impact zone looked like from the outside.
            
            They did know that the explosion had been large enough to send down a fireball that
                blew out <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">elevators</ENAMEX> and windows in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lobby</ENAMEX> and that conditions were so dire that
                some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> on upper <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floors</ENAMEX> were jumping or falling from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>. They also
                knew from building <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> that some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> were trapped in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">elevators</ENAMEX> and on
                specific floors. According to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Division</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chief</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lower Manhattan Peter Hayden</ENAMEX>, "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">We</ENAMEX>
                had a very strong sense we would lose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">firefighters</ENAMEX> and that we were in deep trouble,
                but we had estimates of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25,000 to 50,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX>, and we had to try to rescue
                    them."
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chiefs</ENAMEX> concluded that this would be a rescue operation, not a firefighting
                operation. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chiefs</ENAMEX> present explained: 
            
                We realized that, because of the impact of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX>, that there was some
                    structural damage to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>, and most likely that the fire suppres sion
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX> within the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> were probably damaged and possibly inoperable. . . .
                    We knew that at the height of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> there were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as many as 50,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in
                    this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>. We had a large volume of fire on the upper floors. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX> was
                    <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> an acre in size. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Several</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floors</ENAMEX> of fire would have been beyond the
                    fire-extinguishing capability of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> that we had on hand. So we
                    determined, very early on, that this was going to be strictly a rescue mission.
                    We were going to vacate the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>, get everybody out, and then we were going
                    to get out.
                
            
            The specifics of the mission were harder to determine, as they had almost no
                information about the situation <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80 or more</NUMEX> stories above them. They also received
                advice from senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chiefs</ENAMEX> that while the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> might eventually suffer a
                partial collapse on upper floors, such structural failure was not imminent. No one
                anticipated the possibility of a total collapse.
            
            Emergency medical services (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EMS</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> were directed to one of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> triage areas
                being set up around the perimeter of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTC</ENAMEX>. Some entered the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lobby</ENAMEX> to respond to
                specific casualty reports. In addition, many <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ambulance</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">paramedics</ENAMEX> from private
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> were rushing to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>.
            
            NYPD Initial Response
            Numerous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYPD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> saw the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> strike the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North Tower</ENAMEX> and immediately reported
                it to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYPD</ENAMEX> communications <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dispatchers</ENAMEX>.
            
            At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:58</TIMEX>, while en route, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYPD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chief</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department</ENAMEX> raised the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYPD</ENAMEX>'s mobilization
                to level <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4</TIMEX>, thereby sending to the WTC <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 22</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lieutenants</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sergeants</ENAMEX>,
                and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">800</NUMEX> police <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> from all over the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chief</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department</ENAMEX> arrived at
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Church</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vesey</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:00</TIMEX>.
            
            At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:01</TIMEX>, the NYPD patrol mobilization point was moved to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vesey</ENAMEX> in order to
                handle the greater number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patrol officers</ENAMEX> dispatched in the higher-level
                mobilization. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> would be stationed around the perimeter of the complex
                to direct the evacuation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX>. Many were diverted on the way to the scene by
                intervening emergencies related to the attack.
            
            At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:50</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aviation</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Unit</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYPD</ENAMEX> dispatched <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">helicopters</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTC</ENAMEX> to
                report on conditions and assess the feasibility of a rooftop <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">landing</ENAMEX> or of special
                rescue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX>. En route, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">helicopters</ENAMEX> communicated with air traffic
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">controllers</ENAMEX> at the area's <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> major <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airports</ENAMEX> and informed them of the commercial
                airplane crash at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Trade Center</ENAMEX>. The air traffic controllers had been
                unaware of the incident.
            
            At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:56</TIMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYPD ESU</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> asked to be picked up at the Wall Street heliport to
                initiate rooftop rescues. At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:58</TIMEX>, however, after assessing the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North Tower</ENAMEX> roof, a
                helicopter <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot</ENAMEX> advised the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESU</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> that they could not land on the roof,
                because"it is too engulfed in flames and heavy smoke condition."
            
            By <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:00</TIMEX>, a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> NYPD <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">helicopter</ENAMEX> was responding to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYPD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">helicopters</ENAMEX>
                and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESU</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> remained on the scene throughout <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX>, prepared to commence
                rescue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> on the roof if conditions improved. Both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYPD</ENAMEX> protocols
                called for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> to be placed in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYPD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">helicopters</ENAMEX> in the event of an
                attempted rooftop rescue at a high-rise fire. No <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> were placed in NYPD
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">helicopters</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 11</TIMEX>.
            
            The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">911</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operators</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dispatchers</ENAMEX> were not advised that rooftop rescues were not
                being undertaken. They thus were not able to communicate this fact to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">callers</ENAMEX>, some
                of whom spoke of attempting to climb to the roof.
            
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> on-duty <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYPD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> were on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">20th</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North Tower</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:46</TIMEX>. They
                climbed to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">29th</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX>, urging <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> to evacuate, but did not locate a group
                of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> trapped on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">22nd</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX>.
            
            Just before <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:00</TIMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESU</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> began to walk from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Church</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vesey</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North Tower</ENAMEX>
                lobby, with the goal of climbing toward and setting up a triage center on the upper
                floors for the severely injured. A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> ESU <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> would follow them to assist in
                removing those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>.
            
            Numerous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> responded in order to help injured <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> and to urge those who
                could walk to vacate the area immediately. Putting themselves in danger of falling
                debris, several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> entered the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plaza</ENAMEX> and successfully rescued at least one
                injured, nonambulatory civilian, and attempted to rescue others.
            
            Also by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 9:00</TIMEX>, transit <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> began shutting down subway <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stations</ENAMEX> in the
                vicinity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Trade Center</ENAMEX> and evacuating <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> from those
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stations</ENAMEX>.
            
            Around the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYPD</ENAMEX> cleared major thoroughfares for emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicles</ENAMEX> to
                access the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTC</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYPD</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAPD</ENAMEX> coordinated the closing of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridges</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tunnels</ENAMEX>
                into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manhattan</ENAMEX>.
            
            PAPD Initial Response
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Port Authority</ENAMEX>'s on-site commanding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police officer</ENAMEX> was standing in the concourse
                when a fireball erupted out of elevator shafts and exploded onto the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mall concourse</ENAMEX>,
                causing him to dive for cover. The on-duty <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sergeant</ENAMEX> initially instructed the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTC Command</ENAMEX> to meet at the police <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">desk</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTC</ENAMEX>. Soon thereafter, he
                instructed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> arriving from outside commands to meet him at the fire safety
                desk in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North Tower</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lobby</ENAMEX>. A few of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> from outside commands were
                given <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTC Command</ENAMEX> radios.
            
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Port Authority</ENAMEX> police <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTC</ENAMEX> immediately began climbing stairwell C
                in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North Tower</ENAMEX>.
            
            Other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> began performing rescue and evacuation operations on the ground floors
                and in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PATH</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Port Authority</ENAMEX> Trans-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hudson</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX> below the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>.
            Within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> of impact, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Port Authority</ENAMEX> police <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PATH</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridges</ENAMEX>,
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tunnels</ENAMEX>, and airport commands began responding to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTC</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAPD</ENAMEX> lacked written
                standard operating procedures for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> responding from outside commands to the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTC</ENAMEX> during a major incident. In addition, offi cers from some PAPD commands lacked
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interoperable</ENAMEX> radio frequencies. As a result, there was no comprehensive
                coordination of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAPD</ENAMEX>'s overall response.
            
            At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:00</TIMEX>, the PAPD commanding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTC</ENAMEX> ordered an evacuation of all
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> in the World <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Trade Center</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>, because of the magnitude of the
                calamity in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North Tower</ENAMEX>. This order was given over <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">police</ENAMEX> radio <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX>,
                which could not be heard by the deputy fire safety <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">South Tower</ENAMEX>.
            
            Also at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:00</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAPD Superintendent</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chief</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department</ENAMEX> arrived separately and
                made their way to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North Tower</ENAMEX>.
            
            OEM Initial Response
            By <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:48</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OEM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX> on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">23rd</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> WTC-just to the north
                of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North Tower</ENAMEX>-began to activate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Emergency Operations Center</ENAMEX> by calling such
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYPD</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Health</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Greater Hospital</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Association</ENAMEX> and instructing them to send their designated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> to the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OEM</ENAMEX>. In addition, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Emergency Management Agency</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FEMA</ENAMEX>) was called and
                asked to send <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least five</NUMEX> federal <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Urban Search and Rescue Teams</ENAMEX> (such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> are
                located throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>). At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">approximately 8:50</TIMEX>, a senior
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OEM</ENAMEX> arrived in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lobby</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North Tower</ENAMEX> and began to act
                as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">OEM</ENAMEX> field responder to the incident. He soon was joined by several other OEM
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>, including the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OEM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX>.
            
            Summary
            In the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">17-minute</TIMEX> period <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">between 8:46 and 9:03 A.M.</TIMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 11</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York City</ENAMEX> and
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Port Authority of New York</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Jersey</ENAMEX> had mobilized the largest rescue
                operation in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>'s history. Well <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">over a thousand first responders</TIMEX> had been
                deployed, an evacuation had begun, and the critical decision that the fire could not
                be fought had been made.
            Then the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> hit.
            From <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:03 until 9:59 A.M.</TIMEX>
            At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:03:11</TIMEX>, the hijacked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Airlines</ENAMEX> Flight 175 hit <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTC</ENAMEX> (the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">South Tower</ENAMEX>) from
                the south, crashing through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 77th</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">85th</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floors</ENAMEX>. What had been the largest and
                most complicated rescue operation in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">city</ENAMEX> history instantly doubled in magnitude.
                The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> banked as it hit the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>, leaving portions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> undamaged
                on impact floors. As a consequence-and in contrast to the situation in the
                NorthTower-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the stairwells (A) initially remained passable from at least the
                <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">91st</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX> down, and likely from top to bottom.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Civilians</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fire Safety Personnel</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">911</NUMEX> Calls
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South Tower</ENAMEX>.
            
            At the lower end of the impact, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">78th</NUMEX>-floor <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sky lobby</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> had been waiting
                to evacuate when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> hit. Many had attempted but failed to squeeze into packed
                express <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">elevators</ENAMEX>. Upon impact, many were killed or severely injured; others were
                relatively unharmed. We know of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilian</ENAMEX> who seized the initiative and
                shouted that anyone who could walk should walk to the stairs, and anyone who could
                help should help others in need of assistance. As a result, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX> small
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> descended from that floor. Others remained on the floor to help
                the injured and move <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX> who were unable to walk to the stairwell to aid their
                    rescue.
            
            Still others remained alive in the impact zone above the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">78th</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX>. Damage was
                extensive, and conditions were highly precarious. The only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">survivor</ENAMEX> known to have
                escaped from the heart of the impact zone described the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">81st</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX>-where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wing</ENAMEX> of
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> had sliced through his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>-as a "demolition" site in which everything
                was "broken up" and the smell of jet <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fuel</ENAMEX> was so strong that it was almost
                impossible to breathe. This <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> escaped by means of an unlikely rescue, aided by
                a civilian fire warden descending from a higher floor, who, critically, had been
                provided with a flashlight.
            
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">At least four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> were able to descend stairwell A from the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">81st</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX> or above.
                <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> left the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">84th</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX> immediately after the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> was hit. Even at that point,
                the stairway was dark, smoky, and difficult to navigate; glow strips on the stairs
                and handrails were a significant help. Several flights down, however, the evacuee
                became confused when he reached a smoke door that caused him to believe the stairway
                had ended. He was able to exit that stairwell and switch to another.
            
            Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> in and above the impact zone ascended the stairs. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> small group
                reversed its descent down stairwell A after being advised by another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilian</ENAMEX> that
                they were approaching a floor "in flames." The only known <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">survivor</ENAMEX> has told us that
                their intention was to exit the stairwell in search of clearer air. At the 91st
                floor, joined by others from intervening floors, they perceived themselves to be
                trapped in the stairwell and began descending again. By <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this time</TIMEX>, the stairwell was
                "pretty black," intensifying smoke caused many to pass out, and fire had ignited in
                the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">82nd</NUMEX>-floor transfer <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">hallway</ENAMEX>.
            
            Others ascended to attempt to reach the roof but were thwarted by locked doors. At
                <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9</TIMEX>:<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">30</NUMEX> a "lock release" order-which would unlock all areas in the
                complex controlled by the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>' computerized security system, including doors
                leading to the roofs-was transmitted to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Security Command Center</ENAMEX> located on the
                22nd floor of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North Tower</ENAMEX>. Damage to the software controlling the system,
                resulting from the impact of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX>, prevented this order from being
                    executed.
            
            Others, attempting to descend, were frustrated by jammed or locked doors in
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stairwells</ENAMEX> or confused by the structure of the stairwell deviations. By the lower
                70s, however, stairwells A and B were well-lit, and conditions were generally
                    normal.
            
            Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> remained on affected <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floors</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> ascended from a lower
                point into the impact zone, to help evacuate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> or assist the injured.
            
            Within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15 minutes</TIMEX> after the impact, debilitating smoke had reached at least one
                location on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">100th</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX>, and severe smoke conditions were reported throughout
                floors in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 90s and 100s</TIMEX> over the course of the following <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">half hour</TIMEX>. By <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:30</TIMEX>, a
                number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> who had failed to reach the roof remained on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">105th</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX>,
                likely unable to descend because of intensifying smoke in the stairwell. There were
                reports of tremendous smoke on that floor, but <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> area remained less
                affected until shortly before the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> collapsed. There were several areas
                between the impact zone and the uppermost <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floors</ENAMEX> where conditions were better. At
                least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> remained alive on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 88th</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">89th</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floors</ENAMEX>, in some cases
                calling <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">911</NUMEX> for direction.
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">911</ENAMEX> system remained plagued by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operators</ENAMEX>' lack of awareness of what was
                occurring. Just as in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North Tower</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">callers</ENAMEX> from below and above the impact zone
                were advised to remain where they were and wait for help. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operators</ENAMEX> were not
                given any information about the inability to conduct rooftop rescues and therefore
                could not advise <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">callers</ENAMEX> that they had essentially been ruled out. This lack of
                information, combined with the general advice to remain where they were, may have
                caused <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> above the impact not to attempt to descend, although stairwell A
                may have been passable.
            
            In addition, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">911</ENAMEX> system struggled with the volume of calls and rigid standard
                operating procedures according to which calls conveying crucial information had to
                wait to be transferred to either <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EMS</ENAMEX> or FDNY dispatch.
            
            According to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilian</ENAMEX> who was evacuating down stairwell A from the heart of the
                impact zone and who stopped on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">31st</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX> in order to call <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">911</NUMEX>, I told them when
                they answered the phone, where I was, that I had passed somebody on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">44th</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX>,
                injured-they need to get a medic and a stretcher to this floor, and described the
                situation in brief, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> then asked for my phone number, or something, and
                they said-they put me on hold. "You gotta talk to one of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supervisors</ENAMEX>"-and
                suddenly I was on hold. And so I waited a considerable amount of time. Somebody else
                came back on the phone, I repeated the story. And then it happened again. I was on
                hold a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> time, and needed to repeat the story for a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> time. But I told the
                <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> that I am only telling you once. I am getting out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>, here
                are the details, write it down, and do what you should do.
            
            Very few <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">911</NUMEX> calls were received from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floors</ENAMEX> below the impact, but at least one
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> was advised to remain on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">73rd</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX> despite the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">caller</ENAMEX>'s protests that
                <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> was running out. The last known <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">911</ENAMEX> call from this location came at
                    <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:52</TIMEX>.
            
            Evidence suggests that the public-address system did not continue to function after
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> was hit. A group of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> trapped on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">97th</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX>, however, made
                repeated references in calls to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">911</NUMEX> to having heard "announcements" to go down the
                stairs. Evacuation tones were heard in locations both above and below the impact
                    zone.
            
            By <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:35</TIMEX>, the West Street <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lobby</ENAMEX> level of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SouthTower</ENAMEX> was becoming overwhelmed by
                injured <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who had descended to the lobby but were having difficulty going on.
                Those who could continue were directed to exit north or east through the concourse
                and then out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>.
            
            By <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:59</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> had descended from as high as the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">91st</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX> of that
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tower</ENAMEX>, and stairwell A was reported to have been almost empty. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stairwell</ENAMEX> B was also
                reported to have contained only a handful of descending <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> at an earlier
                point in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX>. But just before the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> collapsed, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> of NYPD ESU
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> encountered a stream of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> descending an unidentified <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stairwell</ENAMEX> in
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 20s</TIMEX>. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> may have been descending from at or above the impact
                    zone.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North Tower</ENAMEX>.
            
            In the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North Tower</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> continued their evacuation. On the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">91st</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX>, the
                highest floor with stairway access, all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> but one were uninjured and able to
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">descend</ENAMEX>. While some complained of smoke, heat, fumes, and crowding in the
                stairwells, conditions were otherwise fairly normal on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floors</ENAMEX> below the impact. At
                least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> stairwell was reported to have been "clear and bright" from the upper 80s
                    down.
            
            Those who called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">911</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floors</ENAMEX> below the impact were generally advised to remain in
                place. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> trapped on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">83rd</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX> pleaded repeatedly to know whether the
                fire was above or below them, specifically asking if <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">911</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operators</ENAMEX> had any
                information from the outside or from the news. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">callers</ENAMEX> were transferred back and
                forth several times and advised to stay put. Evidence suggests that these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">callers</ENAMEX>
                    died.
            
            At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:59</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Port Authority</ENAMEX> police desk at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Newark Airport</ENAMEX> told a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> that a
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group of Port Authority</ENAMEX> civilian <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">64th</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX> should evacuate. (The
                <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> was not at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTC</ENAMEX>, but had been in phone contact with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> on the
                64th floor.) At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:10</TIMEX>, in response to an inquiry from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> themselves, the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Port Authority</ENAMEX> police <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">desk</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jersey City</ENAMEX> confirmed that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">64th</NUMEX> floor
                should "be careful, stay near the stairwells, and wait for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> to come up."
                When the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> inquired again at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:31</TIMEX>, the police desk at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Newark Airport</ENAMEX>
                advised that they "absolutely" evacuate. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">party</ENAMEX> informed the police desk
                that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> had previously received contrary advice from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX>, which
                could only have come via <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">911</NUMEX>. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> were not trapped, yet unlike most
                occupants on the upper floors, they had chosen not to descend immediately after
                impact. They eventually began to descend the stairs, but most of them died in the
                collapse of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North Tower</ENAMEX>.
            
            All <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> who reached the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lobby</ENAMEX> were directed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYPD</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAPD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> into the
                concourse, where other police <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> guided them to exit the concourse and complex
                to the north and east so that they might avoid falling debris and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victims</ENAMEX>.
            
            By <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:55</TIMEX>, only a few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> were descending above the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">25th</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX> in stair well B;
                these primarily were injured, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">handicapped</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elderly</ENAMEX>, or severely overweight
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX>, in some cases being assisted by other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX>.
            
            By <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:59</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tenants</ENAMEX> from the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">91st</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX> had already descended the stairs and exited the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">concourse</ENAMEX>. However, a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> remained in at least stairwell C,
                approaching lower floors. Other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">evacuees</ENAMEX> were killed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> by debris falling on
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY Response</ENAMEX>
            Increased Mobilization.
            
            Immediately after the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> hit, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chief</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department</ENAMEX> called a second
                <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX> alarm.
            
            By <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:15</TIMEX>, the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> en route to or present at the scene was far
                greater than the commanding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chiefs</ENAMEX> at the scene had requested. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Five</NUMEX> factors account
                for this disparity. First, while the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second fifth</NUMEX> alarm had called for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> engine and
                <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> ladder <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>, in fact 23 engine and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> ladder <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> were dispatched.
                <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, several other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> self-dispatched. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, because the attacks came so
                close to the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:00</TIMEX> shift change, many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">firefighters</ENAMEX> just going off duty were given
                permission by company <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> to "ride heavy" and became part of those on-duty
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX>, under the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> of that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Fourth</NUMEX>, many off-duty
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">firefighters</ENAMEX> responded from firehouses separately from the on-duty <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> (in some
                cases when expressly told not to) or from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX>. The arrival of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> in excess
                of that dispatched was particularly pronounced in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX>'s elite <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>.
                <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Fifth</NUMEX>, numerous additional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX>-such as fire marshals and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">firefighters</ENAMEX> in
                administrative positions-who lacked a predetermined operating role also reported to
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTC</ENAMEX>.
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Repeater System</ENAMEX>.
            
            Almost immediately after the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">South Tower</ENAMEX> was hit, senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chiefs</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Tower lobby</ENAMEX> huddled to discuss strategy for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">towers</ENAMEX>. Of
                particular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chiefs</ENAMEX>-in light of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX> difficulties in responding to the
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX> bombing-was communications capability. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chiefs</ENAMEX> recommended testing
                the repeater channel to see if it would work.
            
            Earlier, an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> had asked building <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> to activate the repeater <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX>,
                which would enable greatly-enhanced FDNY portable radio communications in the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">high-rises</ENAMEX>. One button on the repeater system activation console in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North Tower</ENAMEX>
                was pressed at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:54</TIMEX>, though it is unclear by whom. As a result of this activation,
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">communication</ENAMEX> became possible between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX> portable radios on the repeater <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX>.
                In addition, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">repeater</ENAMEX>'s master <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">handset</ENAMEX> at the fire safety desk could hear
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">communications</ENAMEX> made by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX> portable radios on the repeater <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX>. The activation
                of transmission on the master handset required, however, that a second button be
                pressed. That second button was never activated on <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 11</TIMEX>.
            
            At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:05</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chiefs</ENAMEX> tested the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>'s repeater system. Because the second
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">button</ENAMEX> had not been activated, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> on the master <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">handset</ENAMEX> could not transmit.
                He was also apparently unable to hear another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> who was attempting to
                communicate with him from a portable radio, either because of a technical problem or
                because the volume was turned down on the console (the normal setting when the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX> was not in use). Because the repeater <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> seemed inoperable-the master
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">handset</ENAMEX> appeared unable to transmit or receive communications-the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chiefs</ENAMEX> in the
                NorthTower <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lobby</ENAMEX> decided not to use it. The repeater system was working at least
                partially, however, on portable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX> radios, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">firefighters</ENAMEX> subsequently used
                repeater channel <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">7</NUMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">South Tower</ENAMEX>.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY North Tower Operations</ENAMEX>.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Command</ENAMEX> and control decisions were affected by the lack of knowledge of what was
                happening <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30, 60, 90</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floors</ENAMEX> above. According to one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chiefs</ENAMEX> in the
                lobby, "One of the most critical things in a major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX> like this is to have
                information. We didn't have a lot of information coming in. We didn't receive any
                reports of what was seen from the [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYPD</ENAMEX>] <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">helicopters</ENAMEX>. It was impossible to know how
                much damage was done on the upper floors, whether the stairwells were intact or
                    not."
            
            According to another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> present, "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> watching on TV certainly had more
                knowledge of what was happening <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floors</ENAMEX> above us than we did in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lobby</ENAMEX>.
                . . . [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX>]ithout critical information coming in . . . it's very difficult to make
                informed, critical decisions[.]"
            
            As a result, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chiefs</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lobby</ENAMEX> disagreed over whether anyone at or above the impact
                zone possibly could be rescued, or whether there should be even limited firefighting
                for the purpose of cutting exit routes through fire zones.
            
            Many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> were simply instructed to ascend toward the impact zone and report back to
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lobby</ENAMEX> via radio. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> were directed to assist specific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> trapped in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">elevators</ENAMEX> or in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> well below the impact zone. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> FDNY
                company successfully rescued some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> who were trapped on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">22nd</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX> as a
                result of damage caused by the initial fireball.
            
            An attempt was made to track responding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>' assignments on a magnetic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX>, but
                the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> and individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">firefighters</ENAMEX> arriving in the lobby made this an
                overwhelming task. As the fire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> were not advised to the contrary, they
                followed protocol and kept their radios on tactical channel <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, which would be
                monitored by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chiefs</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lobby</ENAMEX>. Those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">battalion chiefs</ENAMEX> who would climb would
                operate on a separate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">command channel</ENAMEX>, which also would be monitored by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chiefs</ENAMEX>
                in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lobby</ENAMEX>.
            
            Fire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> began to ascend stairwell B at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">approximately 9:07</TIMEX>, laden with about
                <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100 pounds</NUMEX> of heavy protective clothing, self-contained breathing apparatuses, and
                other equipment (including hoses for engine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> and heavy tools for ladder
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>)<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.111</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Firefighters</ENAMEX> found the stairways they entered intact, lit, and clear
                of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">smoke</ENAMEX>. Unbeknownst to the lobby command post, one <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">battalion chief</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tower</ENAMEX> found a working elevator, which he took to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">16th</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX> before beginning to
                    climb.
            
            In ascending stairwell B, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">firefighters</ENAMEX> were passing a steady and heavy stream of
                descending <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Firemen</ENAMEX> were impressed with the composure and total lack of
                panic shown by almost all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX>. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> were in awe of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">firefighters</ENAMEX>
                and found their mere presence to be calming.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Firefighters</ENAMEX> periodically stopped on particular floors and searched to ensure that no
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> were still on it. In a few instances healthy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> were found on
                floors, either because they still were collecting personal items or for no apparent
                reason; they were told to evacuate immediately. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Firefighters deputized</ENAMEX> healthy
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> to be in charge of others who were struggling or injured.
            
            Climbing up the stairs with heavy protective clothing and equipment was hard work
                even for physically fit <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">firefighters</ENAMEX>. As <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">firefighters</ENAMEX> began to suffer varying levels
                of fatigue, some became separated from others in their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX>.
            
            At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:32</TIMEX>, a senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> radioed all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North Tower</ENAMEX> to return to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lobby</ENAMEX>,
                either because of a false report of a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> approaching or because of his
                judgment about the deteriorating condition of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>. Once the rumor of the
                <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> was debunked, other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chiefs</ENAMEX> continued operations, and there is no
                evidence that any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> actually returned to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lobby</ENAMEX>. At the same time, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> in
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lobby</ENAMEX> was asked to consider the possibility of a rooftop rescue but was unable
                to reach FDNY dispatch by radio or phone. Out on West Street, however, the FDNY
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chief</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department</ENAMEX> had already dismissed any rooftop rescue as impossible.
            
            As <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">units</ENAMEX> climbed higher, their ability to communicate with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chiefs</ENAMEX> on tactical <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
                became more limited and sporadic, both because of the limited effectiveness of FDNY
                radios in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">high-rises</ENAMEX> and because so many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> on tactical <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> were trying to
                communicate at once. When attempting to reach a particular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chiefs</ENAMEX> in the lobby
                often heard nothing in response.
            
            Just prior to <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10:00</TIMEX>, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North Tower</ENAMEX> one engine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> had climbed to the 54th
                floor, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX> other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">firefighters</ENAMEX> had reached the sky lobby on the
                44th floor, and numerous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> were located between the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">5th</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37th</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floors</ENAMEX>.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY South Tower</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marriott Hotel Operations</ENAMEX>.
            
            Immediately after the repeater test, a senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> and a battalion chief commenced
                operations in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">South Tower</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lobby</ENAMEX>. Almost at once they were joined by an OEM field
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">responder</ENAMEX>. They were not, however, joined right away by a sizable number of fire
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>, as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> that had been in or en route to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North Tower</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lobby</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:03</TIMEX>
                were not reallocated to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">South Tower</ENAMEX>.
            
            A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">battalion chief</ENAMEX> and a ladder <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> found a working elevator to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">40th</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX> and
                from there proceeded to climb stairwell B. Another ladder <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> arrived soon
                thereafter, and began to rescue <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> trapped in an elevator between the first
                and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floors</ENAMEX>. The senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lobby</ENAMEX> expressed frustration about the
                lack of units he initially had at his disposal for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SouthTower</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX>.
            
            Unlike the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commanders</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North Tower</ENAMEX>, the senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lobby</ENAMEX> and the
                ascending <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">battalion chief</ENAMEX> kept their radios on repeater channel <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>. For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first 15</TIMEX>
                <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX>, communications among them and the ladder <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> climbing
                with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">battalion chief</ENAMEX> worked well. Upon learning from a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> security official
                that the impact zone began at the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">78th</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX>, a ladder <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> transmitted this
                information, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">battalion chief</ENAMEX> directed an engine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> staged on the 40th
                floor to attempt to find an elevator to reach that upper level.
            
            To our knowledge, no FDNY <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chiefs</ENAMEX> outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">South Tower</ENAMEX> realized that the repeater
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">channel</ENAMEX> was functioning and being used by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> in that <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX>. The senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> in
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">South Tower</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lobby</ENAMEX> was initially unable to communicate his requests for more
                units to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chiefs</ENAMEX> either in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North Tower</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lobby</ENAMEX> or at the outdoor command post.
            
            From <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">approximately 9:21</TIMEX> on, the ascending <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">battalion chief</ENAMEX> was unable to reach the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South Tower</ENAMEX> lobby command post because the senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lobby</ENAMEX> had ceased to
                communicate on repeater channel <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>. The vast majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> that entered the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SouthTower</ENAMEX> did not communicate on the repeater <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX>.
            
            The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> FDNY fatality of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> occurred at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">approximately 9:30</TIMEX>, when a civilian
                landed on and killed a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">fireman</ENAMEX> near the intersection of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Liberty</ENAMEX>
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>.
            
            By <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:30</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chiefs</ENAMEX> in charge of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">South Tower</ENAMEX> still were in need of additional
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>. Several factors account for the lag in response. First, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX> units
                that had been dispatched to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North Tower</ENAMEX> prior to <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:03</TIMEX> reported immediately to
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">South Tower</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> were not actually sent until <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">approximately five</TIMEX>
                <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chief</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department</ENAMEX> ordered their dispatch. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, those
                units that had been ordered at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:53</TIMEX> to stage at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brooklyn</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Battery Tunnel</ENAMEX>-and thus
                very close to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>-were not dispatched after the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> hit the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tower</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Fourth</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">units</ENAMEX> parked further north on West Street, then proceeded south on
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">foot</ENAMEX> and stopped at the overall FDNY command post on West Street, where in some
                cases they were told to wait. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Fifth</NUMEX>, some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> responded directly to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tower</ENAMEX>. (Indeed, radio communications indicated that in certain cases some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">firemen</ENAMEX>
                believed that the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">South Tower</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 WTC</NUMEX> when in fact it was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 WTC</NUMEX>.) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sixth</ENAMEX>, some
                units couldn't find the staging area (at West Street south of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Liberty</ENAMEX>) for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tower</ENAMEX>. Finally, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">jumpers</ENAMEX> and debris that confronted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> attempting to enter the
                SouthTower from its main entrance on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Liberty Street</ENAMEX> caused some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> to search for
                indirect ways to enter that <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX>, most often through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marriott Hotel</ENAMEX>, or simply
                to remain on West Street.
            
            A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> at the overall outdoor command post was under the impression that he was to
                assist in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lobby operations</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">South Tower</ENAMEX>, and in fact his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aide</ENAMEX> already was in
                that lobby. But because of his lack of familiarity with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> and
                confusion over how to get to there, he instead ended up in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marriott</ENAMEX> at about
                <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:35</TIMEX>. Here he came across <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 14</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">units</ENAMEX>, many of which had been trying to find safe
                access to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">South Tower</ENAMEX>. He directed them to secure the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">elevators</ENAMEX> and conduct
                search-and-rescue operations on the upper floors of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marriott</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> of these
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> searched the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">spa</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX>'s top floor-the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">22nd</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX>-for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX>,
                and found none.
            
            Feeling satisfied with the scope of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marriott</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> in the
                lobby there directed some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> to proceed to what he thought was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SouthTower</ENAMEX>. In
                fact, he pointed them to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NorthTower</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> who had entered
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NorthTower</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marriott</ENAMEX> found a working elevator in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX> at the south end
                of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lobby</ENAMEX>, which they took to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">23rd</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX>.
            
            In response to the shortage of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">South Tower</ENAMEX>, at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:37 an additional second</TIMEX>
                alarm was requested by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> at the West and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Liberty</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> staging area. At
                this time, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that earlier</TIMEX> had been staged on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brooklyn</ENAMEX> side of the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel</ENAMEX> were dispatched to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">South Tower</ENAMEX>; some had gone through
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tunnel</ENAMEX> already and had responded to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marriott</ENAMEX>, not the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">South Tower</ENAMEX>.
            
            Between <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:45 and 9:58</TIMEX>, the ascending <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">battalion chief</ENAMEX> continued to lead FDNY
                operations on the upper floors of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">South Tower</ENAMEX>. At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:50</TIMEX>, an FDNY ladder company
                encountered numerous seriously injured <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">70th</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX>. With the
                assistance of a security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guard</ENAMEX>, at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:53</TIMEX> a group of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> trapped in an elevator
                on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 78th</TIMEX>-floor <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sky lobby</ENAMEX> were found by an FDNY <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>. They were freed from the
                elevator at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:58</TIMEX>. By that time the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">battalion chief</ENAMEX> had reached the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">78th</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX> on
                stairwell A; he reported that it looked open to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">79th</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX>, well into the impact
                zone. He also reported numerous civilian fatalities in the area.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY Command</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control</ENAMEX> Outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Towers</ENAMEX>.
            
            The overall command post consisted of senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chiefs</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commissioners</ENAMEX>, the field
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">communications van</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Field Comm</ENAMEX>), numerous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> that began to arrive after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tower</ENAMEX> was hit, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EMS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chiefs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX>.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Field Comm</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> main functions were to relay information between the overall
                operations command post and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX> dispatch and to track all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> operating at the
                scene on a large magnetic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX>. Both of these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">missions</ENAMEX> were severely compromised by
                the magnitude of the disaster on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 11</TIMEX>. First, the means of transmitting
                information were unreliable. For example, while FDNY dispatch advised <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Field Comm</ENAMEX>
                that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> were reported via <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">911</NUMEX> to be trapped on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">105th</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tower</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Field Comm</ENAMEX> then attempted to convey that report to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chiefs</ENAMEX> at the outdoor
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">command</ENAMEX> post, this information did not reach the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North Tower</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lobby</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Field</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Comm</ENAMEX>'s ability to keep track of which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> were operating where was limited,
                because many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> reported directly to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North Tower</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">South Tower</ENAMEX>, or the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marriott</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, efforts to track <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> by listening to tactical <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> were severely
                hampered by the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> using that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX>; as many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> tried to speak at
                once, their transmissions overlapped and often became indecipherable. In the opinion
                of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Field Comm</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, tactical <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> simply was not designed to
                handle the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> operating on it <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">that morning</TIMEX>.
            
            The primary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Field Comm van</ENAMEX> had access to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYPD</ENAMEX>'s Special <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Operations</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> (used
                by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYPD Aviation</ENAMEX>), but it was in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garage</ENAMEX> for repairs on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 11</TIMEX>. The backup
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">van</ENAMEX> lacked that capability.
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chief</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department</ENAMEX>, along with civilian <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commissioners</ENAMEX> and senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EMS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chiefs</ENAMEX>,
                organized <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ambulances</ENAMEX> on West Street to expedite the transport of injured <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX>
                to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>.
            
            To our knowledge, none of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chiefs</ENAMEX> present believed that a total collapse of either
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tower</ENAMEX> was possible. One senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> did articulate his concern that upper floors
                could begin to collapse in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a few hours</TIMEX>, and that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">firefighters</ENAMEX> thus should not ascend
                above floors in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 60s</TIMEX>. That opinion was not conveyed to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chiefs</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North Tower</ENAMEX>
                lobby, and there is no evidence that it was conveyed to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chiefs</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South Tower</ENAMEX>
                lobby either.
            
            Although the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chief</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department</ENAMEX> had general authority over operations, tactical
                decisions remained the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lobby commanders</ENAMEX>. The highest-ranking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX>
                in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North Tower</ENAMEX> was responsible for communicating with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chief</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department</ENAMEX>.
                They had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> brief conversations. In the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, the senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lobby chief</ENAMEX> gave the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chief</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department</ENAMEX> a status report and confirmed that this was a rescue, not
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">firefighting</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX>. In the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> conversation, at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 9:45</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chief</ENAMEX> of
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Department</ENAMEX> suggested that given how the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North Tower</ENAMEX> appeared to him, the senior
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lobby chief</ENAMEX> might want to consider evacuating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX>.
            
            At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:46</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chief</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department</ENAMEX> called an additional <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX> alarm, and at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:54 an</TIMEX>
                additional <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> engine and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> ladder <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> were sent to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTC</ENAMEX>. As a result, more
                than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one-third</NUMEX> of all FDNY <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> now had been dispatched to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTC</ENAMEX>. At about
                <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:57</TIMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EMS</ENAMEX> paramedic approached the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chief</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department</ENAMEX> and advised that an
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineer</ENAMEX> in front of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTC</ENAMEX> had just remarked that the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Twin Towers</ENAMEX> in fact were in
                imminent danger of a total collapse.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYPD Response</ENAMEX>
            Immediately after the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> hit, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chief</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of the NYPD</ENAMEX> ordered a
                second <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Level</ENAMEX> 4 mobilization, bringing the total number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYPD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> responding
                to close to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,000</NUMEX>.
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYPD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chief</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department</ENAMEX> called for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Operation Omega</ENAMEX>, which required the
                protection of sensitive locations around the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">NYPD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX> were secured
                and all other government <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> were evacuated.
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESU</ENAMEX> command post at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Church</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vesey</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> coordinated all NYPD ESU rescue
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX>. After the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">South Tower</ENAMEX> was hit, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESU</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> running this command post
                decided to send <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESU</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> (each with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately six</NUMEX> police <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX>) up each
                of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Twin Towers</ENAMEX>' stairwells. While he continued to monitor the citywide SOD
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">channel</ENAMEX>, which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYPD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">helicopters</ENAMEX> were using, he also monitored the point-to-point
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tactical</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESU</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> climbing in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">towers</ENAMEX> would use.
            
            The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> NYPD ESU <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> entered the West Street-level lobby of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North Tower</ENAMEX> and
                prepared to begin climbing at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 9:15 A.M.</TIMEX> They attempted to check in with the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chiefs</ENAMEX> present, but were rebuffed. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OEM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> did not intervene. The ESU
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">team</ENAMEX> began to climb the stairs. Shortly thereafter, a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> NYPD ESU <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> entered
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">South Tower</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">OEM</ENAMEX> field responder present ensured that they check in with the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> in charge of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lobby</ENAMEX>, and it was agreed that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESU</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> would ascend
                and support <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX>.
            
            A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> ESU <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> subsequently entered the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North Tower</ENAMEX> at its elevated mezzanine lobby
                level and made no effort to check in with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX> command post. A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> ESU team
                entered the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">South Tower</ENAMEX>. By <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:59</TIMEX>, a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX> ESU <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> was next to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTC</ENAMEX> and preparing
                to enter the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North Tower</ENAMEX>.
            
            By <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">approximately 9:50</TIMEX>, the lead <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESU</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> had reached the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">31st</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX>, observing that
                there appeared to be no more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> still descending. This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESU</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> encountered a
                large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">firefighters</ENAMEX> and administered <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> to some of them who were
                    exhausted.
            
            At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 9:56</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> running the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESU</ENAMEX> command post on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Church</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vesey</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>
                had a final radio communication with one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESU</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">South Tower</ENAMEX>. The
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">team</ENAMEX> then stated that it was ascending via stairs, was somewhere in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 20s</TIMEX>, and was
                making slow progress because of the numerous descending <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> crowding the
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stairwell</ENAMEX>.
            
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> plainclothes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYPD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> without radios or protective gear had begun
                ascending either stairwell A or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">C</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NorthTower</ENAMEX>. They began checking every other
                floor above <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 12th</TIMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX>. Only occasionally did they find any, and in
                those few cases they ordered the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> to evacuate immediately. While checking
                floors, they used office phones to call their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">superiors</ENAMEX>. In one phone call an NYPD
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> instructed them to leave the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North Tower</ENAMEX>, but they refused to do so. As they
                climbed higher, they encountered increasing smoke and heat. Shortly before <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10:00</TIMEX>
                they arrived on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">54th</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX>.
            
            Throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this period</TIMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:03 to 9:59</TIMEX>), a group of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYPD</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Port Authority</ENAMEX> police
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX>, as well as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Secret Service</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>, continued to assist civilians
                leaving the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North Tower</ENAMEX>. They were positioned around the mezzanine lobby level of
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North Tower</ENAMEX>, directing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> leaving stairwells A and C to evacuate down an
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">escalator</ENAMEX> to the concourse. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> instructed those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> who seemed
                composed to evacuate the complex calmly but rapidly. Other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> exiting the
                stairs who were either injured or exhausted collapsed at the foot of these stairs;
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> then assisted them out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>.
            
            When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> reached the concourse, another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYPD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> stationed at the bottom of
                the escalator directed them to exit through the concourse to the north and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">east</ENAMEX> and
                then out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>. This exit route ensured that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> would not be
                endangered by falling debris and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> on West Street, on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plaza</ENAMEX> between the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">towers</ENAMEX>, and on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Liberty Street</ENAMEX>.
            
            Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> positioned themselves at the top of a flight of stairs by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5WTC</TIMEX> that led
                down into the concourse, going into the concourse when necessary to evacuate injured
                or disoriented <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX>. Numerous other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYPD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> were stationed throughout the
                concourse, assisting burned, injured, and disoriented <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX>, as well as
                directing all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> to exit to the north and east. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYPD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> were also in
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">South Tower</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lobby</ENAMEX> to assist in civilian evacuation. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYPD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> stationed on
                <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Vesey Street</ENAMEX> between West Street and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Church Street</ENAMEX> urged <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> not to remain in
                the area and instead to keep walking north.
            
            At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:06</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYPD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chief</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department</ENAMEX> instructed that no <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> were to land on the
                roof of either <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX>. At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 9:30</TIMEX>, one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">helicopters</ENAMEX> present advised that a
                rooftop evacuation still would not be possible. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYPD</ENAMEX> helicopter <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot</ENAMEX> believed
                one portion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North Tower</ENAMEX> roof to be free enough of smoke that a hoist could be
                lowered in order to rescue <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, but there was no one on the roof. This <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot</ENAMEX>'s
                helicopter never attempted to hover directly over the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX>. Another <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">helicopter</ENAMEX> did
                attempt to do so, and its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot</ENAMEX> stated that the severity of the heat from the jet
                fuel-laden fire in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North Tower</ENAMEX> would have made it impossible to hover low enough
                for a rescue, because the high temperature would have destabilized the
                    helicopter.
            
            At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:51</TIMEX>, an aviation <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> warned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> of large pieces of debris hanging from the
                building. Prior to <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:59</TIMEX>, no <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYPD</ENAMEX> helicopter <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot</ENAMEX> predicted that either <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> would
                    collapse.
            
            Interaction of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">911 Calls</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYPD Operations</ENAMEX>.
            
            At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:37</TIMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilian</ENAMEX> on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">106th</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">South Tower</ENAMEX> reported to a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">911</NUMEX> operator
                that a lower floor-the "<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">90</NUMEX>-something floor"-was collapsing. This information was
                conveyed inaccurately by the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">911</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operator</ENAMEX> to an NYPD dispatcher. The dispatcher
                further confused the substance of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">911</ENAMEX> call by telling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYPD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> at the WTC
                complex that "the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">106th</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX> is crumbling" at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:52, 15 minutes</TIMEX> after the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">911</ENAMEX> call
                was placed. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYPD</ENAMEX> dispatcher conveyed this message on the radio frequency used in
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">precincts</ENAMEX> in the vicinity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTC</ENAMEX> and subsequently on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Special Operations</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Division channel</ENAMEX>, but not on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">City Wide</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> 1.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAPD Response</ENAMEX>
            Initial responders from outside <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAPD</ENAMEX> commands proceeded to the police <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">desk</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> WTC
                or to the fire safety desk in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North Tower</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lobby</ENAMEX>. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> were then
                assigned to assist in stairwell evacuations; others were assigned to expedite
                evacuation in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plaza</ENAMEX>, concourse, and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">PATH station</ENAMEX>. As information was received of
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">civilians</ENAMEX> trapped above ground-level floors of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NorthTower</ENAMEX>, other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAPD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX>
                were instructed to climb to those <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floors</ENAMEX> for rescue efforts. Still others began
                climbing toward the impact zone.
            
            At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:11</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAPD Superintendent</ENAMEX> and an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inspector</ENAMEX> began walking up stairwell B of the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North Tower</ENAMEX> to assess damage near and in the impact zone. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAPD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chief</ENAMEX> and several
                other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAPD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> began ascending a stairwell in order to reach the Windows on the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurant</ENAMEX> on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">106th</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX>, from which calls had been made to the PAPD
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">police desk</ENAMEX> reporting at least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> trapped.
            
            Many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAPD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> from different commands responded on their own initiative. By
                <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:30</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PAPD</ENAMEX> central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">police desk</ENAMEX> requested that responding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> meet at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">West</ENAMEX>
                and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vesey</ENAMEX> and await further instructions. In the absence of a predetermined command
                structure to deal with an incident of this magnitude, a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAPD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inspectors</ENAMEX>,
                captains, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lieutenants</ENAMEX> stepped forward at around <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:30</TIMEX> to formulate an on-site
                response plan. They were hampered by not knowing how many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> were responding
                to the site and where those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> were operating. Many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> who
                responded to this command post lacked suitable protective equipment to enter the
                    complex.
            
            By <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:58</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAPD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> had reached <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 44th</TIMEX>-floor sky <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lobby</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North Tower</ENAMEX>.
                Also in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North Tower</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAPD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> was in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-20s</TIMEX> and another
                was in the lower <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20s</TIMEX>. Numerous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAPD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> were also climbing in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">South Tower</ENAMEX>,
                including the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAPD ESU</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX>. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAPD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> were on the ground floors of the
                complex-some assisting in evacuation, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">others</ENAMEX> manning the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">PAPD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">desk</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTC</ENAMEX> or
                assisting at lobby command posts.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OEM Response</ENAMEX>
            After the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">South Tower</ENAMEX> was hit, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OEM</ENAMEX> senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> decided to remain in its
                "bunker" and continue conducting operations, even though all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> had been
                evacuated from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTC</ENAMEX>. At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">approximately 9:30</TIMEX>, a senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OEM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> ordered the
                evacuation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX>, after a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Secret Service</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTC</ENAMEX> advised him that
                additional commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX> were not accounted for. Prior to its evacuation, no
                outside <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> liaisons had reached <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OEM</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">OEM</ENAMEX> field responders were stationed in each
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tower</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lobby</ENAMEX>, at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX> overall command post, and, at least for some period of
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>, at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYPD</ENAMEX> command post at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Church</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vesey</ENAMEX>.
            
            Summary
            The emergency response effort escalated with the crash of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United 175</ENAMEX> into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tower</ENAMEX>. With that escalation, communications as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">command</ENAMEX> and control became
                increasingly critical and increasingly difficult. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> responders assisted
                <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> in evacuating the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">towers</ENAMEX>, even as incident <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commanders</ENAMEX> from
                responding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> lacked knowledge of what other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> and, in some cases,
                their own responders were doing.
            From <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:59 until 10:28 A.M.</TIMEX>
            At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:58:59</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">South Tower</ENAMEX> collapsed in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">ten seconds</TIMEX>, killing all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> and
                emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> inside, as well a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>-both first responders
                and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX>-in the concourse, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marriott</ENAMEX>, and on neighboring <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX>. The
                building collapsed into itself, causing a ferocious windstorm and creating a massive
                debris cloud. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marriott</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX> suffered significant damage as a result of the
                collapse of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">South Tower</ENAMEX>.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Civilian Response</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North Tower</ENAMEX>
            The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">911</NUMEX> calls placed from most locations in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North Tower</ENAMEX> grew increasingly
                desperate as time went on. As <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">late as 10:28</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> remained alive in some
                locations, including on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 92nd</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">79th</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floors</ENAMEX>. Below the impact zone, it is
                likely that most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> who were physically and emotionally capable of descending
                had exited the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> who were nearing the bottom of stairwell C were
                assisted out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYPD</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAPD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX>. Others, who
                experienced difficulty evacuating, were being helped by <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> responders on lower
                    floors.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY Response</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Immediate Impact</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Collapse of the South Tower</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX> overall command post
                and posts in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">NorthTower</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lobby</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marriott</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lobby</ENAMEX>, and the staging area on West
                Street south of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Liberty</ENAMEX> all ceased to operate upon the collapse of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SouthTower</ENAMEX>,
                as did <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EMS</ENAMEX> staging areas, because of their proximity to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>.
            
            Those who had been in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North Tower</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lobby</ENAMEX> had no way of knowing that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tower</ENAMEX> had suffered a complete collapse. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chiefs</ENAMEX> who had fled from the overall command
                post on the west side of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">West Street</ENAMEX> took <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shelter</ENAMEX> in the underground parking <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garage</ENAMEX>
                at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Financial Center</ENAMEX> and were not available to influence <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> for
                <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the next ten minutes</TIMEX> or so.
            
            When the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">South Tower</ENAMEX> collapsed, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">firefighters</ENAMEX> on upper floors of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North Tower</ENAMEX> heard
                a violent roar, and many were knocked off their feet; they saw debris coming up the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stairs</ENAMEX> and observed that the power was lost and emergency lights activated.
                Nevertheless, those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">firefighters</ENAMEX> not standing near windows facing south had no way
                of knowing that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SouthTower</ENAMEX> had collapsed; many surmised that a bomb had
                exploded, or that the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North Tower</ENAMEX> had suffered a partial collapse on its upper
                    floors.
            
            We do not know whether the repeater <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> continued to function after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:59</TIMEX>.
            
            Initial <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Evacuation Instructions</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Communications</ENAMEX>.
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">South Tower</ENAMEX>'s total collapse was immediately communicated on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manhattan</ENAMEX>
                dispatch <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> by an <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">FDNY</ENAMEX> boat on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hudson River</ENAMEX>; but to our knowledge, no one
                at the site received this information, because every <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX> command post had been
                abandoned-including the overall command post, which included the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Field Comm van</ENAMEX>.
                Despite his lack of knowledge of what had happened to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SouthTower</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> in the
                process of evacuating the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NorthTower</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lobby</ENAMEX> sent out an order within a minute of the
                collapse:"<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Command</ENAMEX> to all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tower 1</ENAMEX>, evacuate the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>." Another chief
                from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North Tower</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lobby</ENAMEX> soon followed with an additional evacuation order issued
                on tactical <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>.
            
            Evacuation orders did not follow the protocol for giving instructions when a
                building's collapse may be imminent-a protocol that includes constantly
                repeating"<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mayday</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mayday, Mayday</ENAMEX>"-during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the 29 minutes</TIMEX> between the fall of the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SouthTower</ENAMEX> and that of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NorthTower</ENAMEX>. In addition, most of the evacuation
                instructions did not mention that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SouthTower</ENAMEX> had collapsed. However, at least
                <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">firefighters</ENAMEX> heard evacuation instructions which stated that the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North Tower</ENAMEX>
                was in danger of "imminent collapse."
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY Personnel</ENAMEX> above the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Ground Floors of the North Tower</ENAMEX>.
            
            Within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX>, some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">firefighters</ENAMEX> began to hear evacuation orders over tactical <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. At
                least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> also gave the evacuation instruction on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">command channel</ENAMEX> used
                only by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chiefs</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North Tower</ENAMEX>, which was much less crowded.
            
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">At least two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">battalion chiefs</ENAMEX> on upper floors of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North Tower</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> on the 23rd
                floor and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">35th</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX>-heard the evacuation instruction on the command
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">channel</ENAMEX> and repeated it to everyone they came across. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">23rd</NUMEX> floor
                apparently aggressively took charge to ensure that all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">firefighters</ENAMEX> on the floors in
                the immediate area were evacuating. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">35th</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX> also heard a
                separate radio communication stating that the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">South Tower</ENAMEX> had collapsed (which the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">23rd</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX> may have heard as well). He subsequently acted with a sense
                of urgency, and some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">firefighters</ENAMEX> heard the evacuation order for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time when
                he repeated it on tactical <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. This <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> also had a bullhorn and traveled to each of
                the stairwells and shouted the evacuation order:"<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">All FDNY</ENAMEX>, get the fuck out!"As a
                result of his efforts, many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">firefighters</ENAMEX> who had not been in the process of
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">evacuating</ENAMEX> began to do so.
            
            Other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">firefighters</ENAMEX> did not receive the evacuation transmissions, for one of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
                reasons: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First</ENAMEX>, some FDNY radios did not pick up the transmission because of the
                difficulties of radio communications in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">high-rises</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, the numbers trying to
                use tactical <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> after the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">South Tower</ENAMEX> collapsed may have drowned out some evacuation
                instructions. According to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX> lieutenant who was on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">31st</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX> of the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North Tower</ENAMEX> at the time, "[<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tactical</ENAMEX>] channel <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> just might have been so bogged down
                that it may have been impossible to get that order through." <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">firefighters</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North Tower</ENAMEX> were off-duty and did not
                have radios. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Fourth</NUMEX>, some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">firefighters</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NorthTower</ENAMEX> had been dispatched to the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South Tower</ENAMEX> and likely were on the different tactical channel assigned to that
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tower</ENAMEX>.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North Tower</ENAMEX> who received the evacuation orders did not respond
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">uniformly</ENAMEX>. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>-including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> knew that the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">South Tower</ENAMEX> had
                collapsed-either delayed or stopped their evacuation in order to assist
                nonambulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX>. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> had become separated during the
                climb attempted to regroup so they could descend together. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> began to
                evacuate but, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">eyewitnesses</ENAMEX>, did not hurry. At least several
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">firefighters</ENAMEX> who survived believed that they and others would have evacuated more
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">urgently</ENAMEX> had they known of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">South Tower</ENAMEX>'s complete collapse. Other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">firefighters</ENAMEX>
                continued to sit and rest on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floors</ENAMEX> while other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> descended past them and
                reminded them that they were supposed to evacuate. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">firefighters</ENAMEX> were determined
                not to leave the building while other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> remained inside and, in one
                case, convinced others to remain with them. In another case, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">firefighters</ENAMEX> had
                successfully descended to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lobby</ENAMEX>, where another firefighter then persuaded them
                to reascend in order to look for specific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX>.
            
            Other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> did not hear the evacuation order on their radio but were
                advised orally to leave the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> by other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">firefighters</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> who were
                themselves evacuating.
            
            By <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10:24</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">FDNY</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> reached the bottom of stairwell B and
                entered the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North Tower</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lobby</ENAMEX>. They stood in the lobby for more than a minute, not
                certain what to do, as no <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chiefs</ENAMEX> were present. Finally, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> firefighter-who had
                earlier seen from a window that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SouthTower</ENAMEX> had collapsed-urged that they all
                leave, as this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> could fall as well. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> then proceeded to exit onto West
                Street. While they were doing so, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NorthTower</ENAMEX> began its pancake collapse, killing
                some of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>.
            
            Other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY Personnel</ENAMEX>.
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marriott Hotel</ENAMEX> suffered significant damage in the collapse of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">South Tower</ENAMEX>.
                Those in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lobby</ENAMEX> were knocked down and enveloped in the darkness of a debris
                cloud. Some were hurt but could walk. Others were more severely injured, and some
                were trapped. Several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">firefighters</ENAMEX> came across a group of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 50</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> who had
                been taking <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">shelter</ENAMEX> in the restaurant and assisted them in evacuating. Up above, at
                the time of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">South Tower</ENAMEX>'s collapse <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> were descending the stairs
                single file in a line of approximately <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> survived.
            
            At the time of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SouthTower</ENAMEX>'s collapse, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> were either at the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eastern</ENAMEX> side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North Tower</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lobby</ENAMEX>, near the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mall concourse</ENAMEX>, or actually in the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mall concourse</ENAMEX>, trying to reach the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SouthTower</ENAMEX>. Many of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> were thrown off
                their feet by the collapse of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">South Tower</ENAMEX>; they then attempted to regroup in the
                darkness of the debris cloud and evacuate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> and themselves, not knowing that
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">South Tower</ENAMEX> had collapsed. Several of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">firefighters</ENAMEX> subsequently searched
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">PATH station</ENAMEX> below the concourse-unaware that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAPD</ENAMEX> had cleared the area of
                all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:19</TIMEX>.
            
            At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 10:15</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chief</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chief</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Safety</ENAMEX>, who had
                returned to West Street from the parking <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garage</ENAMEX>, confirmed that the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">South Tower</ENAMEX> had
                collapsed. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chief</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department</ENAMEX> issued a radio order for all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> to evacuate
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North Tower</ENAMEX>, repeating it <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about five</NUMEX> times. He then directed that the FDNY
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">command</ENAMEX> post be moved further north on West Street and told <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> in the area
                to proceed north on <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">West Street toward Chambers Street</ENAMEX>. At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">approximately 10:25</TIMEX>, he
                radioed for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> ladder <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> to respond to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marriott</ENAMEX>, where he was aware that
                both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> were trapped.
            
            Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chiefs</ENAMEX>, including several of those who had been in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North Tower</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lobby</ENAMEX>, did
                not learn that the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">South Tower</ENAMEX> had collapsed until <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 minutes</TIMEX> or more after the
                event. According to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">eyewitnesses</ENAMEX>, however, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> who knew that
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SouthTower</ENAMEX> had collapsed strongly expressed the opinion that the NorthTower
                would not collapse, because unlike the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">South Tower</ENAMEX>, it had not been hit on a
                    corner.
            
            After the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">South Tower</ENAMEX> collapsed, some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">firefighters</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> neighboring the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North Tower</ENAMEX> remained where they were or came closer to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North Tower</ENAMEX>. Some of
                these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">firefighters</ENAMEX> did not know that the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">South Tower</ENAMEX> had collapsed, but many chose
                despite that knowledge to remain in an attempt to save additional lives. According
                to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> such firefighter, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> who was preparing to mount a search-and-rescue
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mission</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marriott</ENAMEX>, "I would never think of myself as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> if I had
                headed north on West Street after [the] <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South Tower</ENAMEX> collapsed." Just outside the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North Tower</ENAMEX> on West Street one firefighter was directing others exiting the
                building, telling them when no <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">jumpers</ENAMEX> were coming down and it was safe to run out.
                A senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> had grabbed an NYPD bullhorn and was urging <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">firefighters</ENAMEX> exiting onto
                West Street to continue running north, well away from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTC</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> of the most
                senior and respected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX> were involved in attempting to rescue
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">firefighters</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marriott</ENAMEX>.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYPD Response</ENAMEX>
            A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYPD Aviation Unit</ENAMEX> radioed that the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">South Tower</ENAMEX> had collapsed
                immediately after it happened, and further advised that all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in the WTC
                complex and nearby areas should be evacuated. At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10:04</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYPD</ENAMEX> aviation reported that
                the top <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> stories of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North Tower</ENAMEX> "were glowing red" and that they might
                collapse. At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10:08</TIMEX>, a helicopter <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot</ENAMEX> warned that he did not believe the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tower</ENAMEX> would last much longer.
            
            Immediately after the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">South Tower</ENAMEX> collapsed, many NYPD radio frequencies became
                overwhelmed with transmissions relating to injured, trapped, or missing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX>. As
                a result, NYPD radio communications became strained on most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX>. Nevertheless,
                they remained effective enough for the two closest NYPD mobilization points to be
                moved further from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTC</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10:06</TIMEX>.
            
            Just like most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">firefighters</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESU</ENAMEX> rescue <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North Tower</ENAMEX> had no idea that
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">South Tower</ENAMEX> had collapsed. However, by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10:00</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESU</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> running the command
                post at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Church</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vesey</ENAMEX> ordered the evacuation of all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESU</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> from the WTC
                complex. This <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX>, who had observed the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">South Tower</ENAMEX> collapse, reported it to ESU
                units in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North Tower</ENAMEX> in his evacuation instruction.
            
            This instruction was clearly heard by the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESU</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> already in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North Tower</ENAMEX>
                and the other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESU</ENAMEX> unit preparing to enter the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESU</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">31st</NUMEX> floor
                found the full collapse of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">South Tower</ENAMEX> so unfathomable that they radioed back to
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESU</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> at the command post and asked him to repeat his communication. He
                reiterated his urgent message.
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESU</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">31st</NUMEX> floor conferred with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> there to ensure that
                they, too, knew that they had to evacuate, then proceeded down stairwell B. During
                the descent, they reported seeing many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">firefighters</ENAMEX> who were resting and did not
                seem to be in the process of evacuating. They further reported advising these
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">firefighters</ENAMEX> to evacuate, but said that at times they were not acknowledged. In the
                opinion of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESU</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX>, some of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">firefighters</ENAMEX> essentially refused
                to take orders from cops. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">At least one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">firefighter</ENAMEX> who was in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North Tower</ENAMEX> has
                supported that assessment, stating that he was not going to take an evacuation
                instruction from a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cop</ENAMEX> that <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX>. However, another firefighter reports that ESU
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> ran past him without advising him to evacuate.
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESU</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">11th</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX> began descending stairwell C after receiving the
                evacuation order. Once near the mezzanine level-where stairwell C ended-this team
                spread out in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> formation, stretching from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floors</ENAMEX> down to the mezzanine
                itself. They used their flashlights to provide a path of beacons through the
                darkness and debris for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> climbing down the stairs. Eventually, when no one
                else appeared to be descending, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESU</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> exited the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North Tower</ENAMEX> and ran one at a
                time to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTC</ENAMEX>, dodging those who still were jumping from the upper floors of the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North Tower</ENAMEX> by acting as spotters for each other. They remained in the area,
                conducting additional searches for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX>; all but <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of them died.
            
            After surviving the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SouthTower</ENAMEX>'s collapse, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESU</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> that had been preparing to
                enter the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North Tower</ENAMEX> spread into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> formation and created a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">path</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX>
                (who had exited from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NorthTower</ENAMEX> mezzanine) to evacuate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> by
                descending the stairs on the north side of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 and 6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTC</ENAMEX>, which led down to Vesey
                Street. They remained at this post until the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NorthTower</ENAMEX> collapsed, yet all
                    survived.
            
            The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> plainclothes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYPD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> who had made it up to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">54th</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX> of the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">NorthTower</ENAMEX> felt the building shake violently at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:59</TIMEX> as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SouthTower</ENAMEX> collapsed
                (though they did not know the cause). Immediately thereafter, they were joined by
                <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">firefighters</ENAMEX> from an FDNY engine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">firefighters</ENAMEX> apparently
                heard an evacuation order on his radio, but responded in a return radio
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">communication</ENAMEX>, "We're not fucking coming out!" However, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">firefighters</ENAMEX> urged the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police officers</ENAMEX> to descend because they lacked the protective gear and equipment
                needed to handle the increasing smoke and heat. The police <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> reluctantly
                began descending, checking that the lower floors were clear of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX>. They
                proceeded down stairwell B, poking their heads into every <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX> and briefly looking
                for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX>.
            
            Other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYPD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> helping <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">evacuees</ENAMEX> on the mezzanine level of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North Tower</ENAMEX> were
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enveloped</ENAMEX> in the debris cloud that resulted from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SouthTower</ENAMEX>'s collapse. They
                struggled to regroup in the darkness and to evacuate both themselves and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX>
                they encountered. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">At least one</NUMEX> of them died in the collapse of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NorthTower</ENAMEX>. At
                least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYPD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> from this area managed to evacuate out toward <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 WTC</TIMEX>, where he
                teamed up with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Port Authority</ENAMEX> police <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> and acted as a spotter in advising
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> who were still exiting when they could safely run from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTC</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> WTC
                and avoid being struck by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> and debris falling from the upper floors.
            
            At the time of the collapse of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">South Tower</ENAMEX>, there were numerous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYPD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> in
                the concourse, some of whom are believed to have died there. Those who survived
                struggled to evacuate themselves in darkness, assisting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> as they exited the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">concourse</ENAMEX> in all directions.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Port Authority Response</ENAMEX>
            The collapse of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">South Tower</ENAMEX> forced the evacuation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAPD</ENAMEX> command post on
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vesey</ENAMEX>, compelling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAPD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> to move north. There is no evidence that
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAPD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> without <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTC Command</ENAMEX> radios received an evacuation order by radio. Some
                of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North Tower</ENAMEX> decided to evacuate, either on their own or in
                consultation with other <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> responders they came across. Some greatly slowed their
                own descent in order to assist nonambulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX>.
            
            After <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10:28 A.M.</TIMEX>
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North Tower</ENAMEX> collapsed at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10:28:25 A.M.</TIMEX>, killing all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> alive on upper
                floors, an undetermined number below, and scores of <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> responders. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX> Chief
                of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Port Authority Police Department Superintendent</ENAMEX>, and many of
                their senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> were killed. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Incredibly</ENAMEX>, twelve <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">firefighters</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAPD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX>,
                and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> who were descending stairwell B of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North Tower</ENAMEX> survived its
                    collapse.
            
            On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 11</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> suffered the largest loss of life-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,973</NUMEX>-on its soil as a
                result of hostile attack in its history. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX> suffered 343 fatalities- the
                largest loss of life of any emergency response <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> in history. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAPD</ENAMEX> suffered
                37 fatalities-the largest loss of life of any police <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> in history. The NYPD
                suffered <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> fatalities-the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> largest loss of life of any police <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> in
                history, exceeded only by the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAPD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> lost <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the same day</TIMEX>.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mayor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giuliani</ENAMEX>, along with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Police</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fire</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commissioners</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OEM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX>,
                moved quickly north and established an emergency operations command post at the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Police Academy</ENAMEX>. Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the coming hours</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> and
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>, state, and federal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> devoted themselves around the clock to putting
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York City</ENAMEX> back on its feet.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EMERGENCY RESPONSE ATTHE PENTAGON</ENAMEX>
            If it had happened on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">any other day</TIMEX>, the disaster at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> would be remembered
                as a singular challenge and an extraordinary national story. Yet the calamity at the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Trade Center</ENAMEX> that same <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> included catastrophic damage <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,000 feet</NUMEX> above
                the ground that instantly imperiled <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tens of thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> experiences
                are not comparable. Nonetheless, broader lessons in integrating multiagency response
                efforts are apparent when we analyze the response at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX>.
            The emergency response at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> represented a mix of local, state, and federal
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">jurisdictions</ENAMEX> and was generally effective. It overcame the inherent complications of
                a response across jurisdictions because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Incident Command System</ENAMEX>, a formalized
                management structure for emergency response, was in place in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Capital</ENAMEX>
                Region on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX>.
            
            Because of the nature of the event-a plane crash, fire, and partial building
                collapse-the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arlington County</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fire Department</ENAMEX> served as incident <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commander</ENAMEX>.
                Different <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> had different roles. The incident required a major rescue, fire,
                and medical response from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arlington County</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">military</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX>-a
                <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> under the control of the secretary of defense. Since it was a terrorist
                attack, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Justice</ENAMEX> was the lead federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> in charge (with
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">authority</ENAMEX> delegated to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> for operational response). Additionally, the
                terrorist attack affected the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> and emergency management requirements
                of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arlington County</ENAMEX> and all bordering and surrounding jurisdictions.
            
            At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:37</TIMEX>, the west wall of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> was hit by hijacked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Airlines</ENAMEX> Flight
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">77</TIMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">757</ENAMEX>. The crash caused immediate and catastrophic damage. All <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">64</NUMEX> people
                aboard the airliner were killed, as were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">125</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> inside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55</NUMEX> military service <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One hundred six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> were seriously
                injured and transported to area <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>.
            
            While no emergency response is flawless, the response to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX> terrorist attack on
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> was mainly a success for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> reasons: <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, the strong professional
                relationships and trust established among emergency responders; <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>, the adoption
                of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Incident Command System</ENAMEX>; and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX>, the pursuit of a regional approach to
                response. Many fire and police <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> that responded had extensive prior
                experience working together on regional events and training exercises. Indeed, at
                the time preparations were under way at many of these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> to ensure public
                safety at the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> meetings of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Monetary Fund</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Bank</ENAMEX>
                scheduled to be held <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later that month</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">D.C.</ENAMEX>
            
            Local, regional, state, and federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> immediately responded to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX>
                attack. In addition to county fire, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sheriff</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">departments</ENAMEX>, the response
                was assisted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald Reagan</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington National Airport Fire Department</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fort Myer Fire Department</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX>
                State <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Police</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Emergency Management</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FEMA</ENAMEX>, a
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Medical ResponseTeam</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms</ENAMEX>, and
                numerous military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> within the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Military District of Washington</ENAMEX>.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Command</ENAMEX> was established at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:41</TIMEX>. At the same time, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arlington County</ENAMEX> Emergency
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Communications Center</ENAMEX> contacted the fire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">departments</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fairfax County</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alexandria</ENAMEX>,
                and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">District of Columbia</ENAMEX> to request mutual aid.
            The incident command post provided a clear view of and access to the crash site,
                allowing the incident <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commander</ENAMEX> to assess the situation at all times.
            
            At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:55</TIMEX>, the incident <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commander</ENAMEX> ordered an evacuation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> impact area
                because a partial collapse was imminent; it occurred at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:57</TIMEX>, and no <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> responder
                was injured.
            
            At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10:15</TIMEX>, the incident <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commander</ENAMEX> ordered a full evacuation of the command post
                because of the warning of an approaching hijacked <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> passed along by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>.
                This was the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> evacuations caused by reports of incoming <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>, and
                the evacuation order was well communicated and well coordinated.
            
            Several factors facilitated the response to this incident, and distinguish it from
                the far more difficult task in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>. There was a single incident, and it was not
                <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,000 feet</NUMEX> above ground. The incident site was relatively easy to secure and
                contain, and there were no other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> in the immediate area. There was no
                collateral damage beyond the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX>.
            
            Yet the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> response encountered difficulties that echo those experienced in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">York</ENAMEX>. As the "<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arlington County</ENAMEX>: After-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Action Report</ENAMEX>" notes, there were significant
                problems with both self-dispatching and communications: "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Organizations</ENAMEX>, response
                units, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> proceeding on their own initiative directly to an incident
                site, without the knowledge and permission of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> jurisdiction and the Incident
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Commander</ENAMEX>, complicate the exercise of command, increase the risks faced by bonafide
                responders, and exacerbate the challenge of accountability." With respect to
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">communications</ENAMEX>, the report concludes: "Almost all aspects of communications continue
                to be problematic, from initial notification to tactical operations. Cellular
                telephones were of little value. . . . Radio <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> were initially oversaturated.
                . . . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pagers</ENAMEX> seemed to be the most reliable means of notification when available and
                used, but most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">firefighters</ENAMEX> are not issued pagers."
            
            It is a fair inference, given the differing situations in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York City</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX>, that the problems in command, control, and communications that occurred at
                both <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> will likely recur in any emergency of similar scale. The task looking
                forward is to enable <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> responders to respond in a coordinated manner with the
                greatest possible awareness of the situation.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANALYSIS</ENAMEX>
            Like the national defense effort described in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">chapter 1</ENAMEX>, the emergency response to
                the attacks on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9/11</TIMEX> was necessarily improvised. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYPD</ENAMEX>, the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Port Authority</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX>, and the building occupants themselves did their best
                to cope with the effects of an unimaginable catastrophe-unfolding furiously over a
                <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">mere 102 minutes</TIMEX>-for which they were unprepared in terms of both training and
                mindset. As a result of the efforts of <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> responders, assistance from each other,
                and their own good instincts and goodwill, the vast majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> below the
                impact zone were able to evacuate the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">towers</ENAMEX>.
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Institute of Standards and Technology</ENAMEX> has provided a preliminary
                estimation that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between 16,400 and 18,800</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> were in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> as of
                <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:46 A.M.</TIMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 11</TIMEX>. At most <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,152</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> died at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> who
                were not (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) fire or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> first responders, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) security or fire safety personnel
                of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTC</ENAMEX> or individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) volunteer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> who ran to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTC</ENAMEX> after
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX>' impact to help others, or (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) on the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX> that crashed into
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">theTwinTowers</ENAMEX>. Out of this total number of fatalities, we can account for the
                workplace location of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,052</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95.35 percent</NUMEX>. Of this number, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,942</NUMEX> or
                <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">94.64 percent</NUMEX> either worked or were supposed to attend a meeting at or above the
                respective impact zones of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Twin Towers</ENAMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 110</NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.36 percent</NUMEX> of those who
                died, worked below the impact zone. While a given <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> location at the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTC</ENAMEX> does not definitively indicate where that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> died that <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> or
                whether he or she could have evacuated, these data strongly suggest that the
                evacuation was a success for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> below the impact zone.
            
            Several factors influenced the evacuation on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 11</TIMEX>. It was aided greatly by
                changes made by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Port Authority</ENAMEX> in response to the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX> bombing and by the
                training of both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Port Authority</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> after that time. Stairwells
                remained lit near unaffected <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floors</ENAMEX>; some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tenants</ENAMEX> relied on procedures learned in
                fire drills to help them to safety; others were guided down the stairs by fire
                safety <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> based in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lobby</ENAMEX>. Because of damage caused by the impact of the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">planes</ENAMEX>, the capability of the sophisticated building <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">systems</ENAMEX> may have been impaired.
                Rudimentary improvements, however, such as the addition of glow strips to the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">handrails</ENAMEX> and stairs, were credited by some as the reason for their survival. The
                general evacuation time for the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">towers</ENAMEX> dropped from <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">more than four hours</TIMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX> to
                under <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one hour</TIMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 11</TIMEX> for most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> who were not trapped or physically
                incapable of enduring a long descent.
            <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX> responders also played a significant role in the success of the evacuation.
                Some specific rescues are quantifiable, such as an FDNY <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX>'s rescue of
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">civilians</ENAMEX> trapped on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">22d</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North Tower</ENAMEX>, or the success of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAPD</ENAMEX>,
                and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYPD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> in carrying nonambulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> out of both the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North and</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South Towers</ENAMEX>. In other instances, intangibles combined to reduce what could have
                been a much higher death total. It is impossible to measure how many more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX>
                who descended to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ground floors</ENAMEX> would have died but for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYPD</ENAMEX> and PAPD
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> directing them-via safe exit routes that avoided <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">jumpers</ENAMEX> and debris-to
                leave the complex urgently but calmly. It is impossible to measure how many more
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> would have died but for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">determination</ENAMEX> of many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX>,
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAPD</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYPD</ENAMEX> to continue assisting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> after the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">South Tower</ENAMEX> collapsed. It
                is impossible to measure the calming influence that ascending <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">firefighters</ENAMEX> had on
                descending <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> or whether but for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">firefighters</ENAMEX>' presence the poor behavior
                of a very few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> could have caused a dangerous and panicked mob flight. But
                the positive impact of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> responders on the evacuation came at a tremendous
                cost of <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> responder lives lost.
            
            Civilian and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Private-Sector Challenges</ENAMEX>
            The "first" <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> responders on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9/11</TIMEX>, as in most catastrophes, were private sector
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX>. Because <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">85 percent</NUMEX> of our <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s critical infrastructure is controlled
                not by government but by the private sector, private-sector <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> are likely to
                be the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> responders in any future catastrophes. For that reason, we have
                assessed the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of private sector and civilian preparedness in order to formulate
                recommendations to address this critical need. Our recommendations grow out of the
                experience of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Trade Center</ENAMEX> on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX>.
            Lack of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Protocol</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rooftop Rescues</ENAMEX>.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Civilians</ENAMEX> at or above the impact zone in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North Tower</ENAMEX> had the smallest hope of
                survival. Once the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> struck, they were prevented from descending because of
                damage to or impassable conditions in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> stairwells. The only hope
                for those on the upper floors of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North Tower</ENAMEX> would have been a swift and
                extensive air rescue. Several factors made this impossible. Doors leading to the
                roof were kept locked for security reasons, and damage to software in the security
                command <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">station</ENAMEX> prevented a lock release order from taking effect. Even if the doors
                had not been locked, structural and radiation hazards made the rooftops unsuitable
                staging areas for a large number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX>; and even if conditions permitted
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">general</ENAMEX> helicopter <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">evacuations</ENAMEX>-which was not the case-only several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> could be
                lifted at a time.
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTC</ENAMEX> lacked any plan for evacuation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> on upper floors of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTC</ENAMEX> in the
                event that all stairwells were impassable below.
            Lack of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Comprehensive Evacuation of South Tower</ENAMEX>.
            
            Immediately after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North Tower Impact</ENAMEX>. No decision has been criticized more than
                the decision of building <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> not to evacuate the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">South Tower</ENAMEX> immediately after
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NorthTower</ENAMEX> was hit. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX> and prompt evacuation order would likely have led
                many to safety. Even a strictly "advisory" announcement would not have dissuaded
                those who decided for themselves to evacuate. The advice to stay in place was
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">understandable</ENAMEX>, however, when considered in its context. At that moment, no one
                appears to have thought a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> could hit the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">South Tower</ENAMEX>. The evacuation of
                <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> was seen as inherently dangerous. Additionally, conditions were
                hazardous in some areas outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">towers</ENAMEX>.
            
            Less understandable, in our view, is the instruction given to some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> who had
                reached the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lobby</ENAMEX> to return to their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>. They could have been held in the lobby
                or perhaps directed through the underground concourse. Despite the initial advice
                given over its public-address system, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">South Tower</ENAMEX> was ordered to be evacuated by
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAPD</ENAMEX> within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12 minutes</TIMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North Tower</ENAMEX>'s being hit. If not for a
                <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>, unanticipated attack, the evacuation presumably would have proceeded.
            Impact of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fire Safety Plan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Fire Drills on Evacuation</ENAMEX>.
            
            Once the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">South Tower</ENAMEX> was hit, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> on upper floors wasted time ascending the
                stairs instead of searching for a clear path down, when stairwell A was at least
                initially passable. Although rooftop rescues had not been conclusively ruled out,
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> were not informed in fire drills that roof doors were locked, that rooftop
                <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">areas</ENAMEX> were hazardous, and that no helicopter evacuation plan existed. In both
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">towers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> who were able to reach the stairs and descend were also stymied by
                the deviations in the stairways and by smoke doors. This confusion delayed the
                evacuation of some and may have obstructed that of others. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Port Authority</ENAMEX> has
                acknowledged that in the future, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tenants</ENAMEX> should be made aware of what conditions
                they will encounter during descent. Impact of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">911</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Calls on Evacuation</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYPD</ENAMEX>'s
                <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">911</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operators</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX> dispatch were not adequately integrated into the emergency
                response. In several ways, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">911</ENAMEX> system was not ready to cope with a major
                disaster. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operators</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dispatchers</ENAMEX> were one of the only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of
                information for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> at and above the impact zone of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">towers</ENAMEX>. The FDNY
                ordered both towers fully evacuated by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:57</TIMEX>, but this guidance was not conveyed to
                <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">911</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operators</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dispatchers</ENAMEX>, who for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the next hour</TIMEX> often continued to advise
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> not to self-evacuate, regardless of whether they were above or below the
                impact zones. Nor were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">911</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operators</ENAMEX> or FDNY <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dispatchers</ENAMEX> advised that rooftop
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rescues</ENAMEX> had been ruled out. This failure may have been harmful to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> on the
                upper floors of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">South Tower</ENAMEX> who called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">911</ENAMEX> and were not told that their only
                evacuation hope was to attempt to descend, not to ascend. In planning for future
                disasters, it is important to integrate those taking <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">911</NUMEX> calls into the emergency
                response <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> and to involve them in providing upto- date information and assistance
                to the public.
            Preparedness of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Individual Civilians</ENAMEX>.
            
            One clear lesson of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 11</TIMEX> is that individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> need to take
                responsibility for maximizing the probability that they will survive, should
                disaster strike. Clearly, many <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> occupants in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Trade Center</ENAMEX> did not
                take preparedness seriously. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Individuals</ENAMEX> should know the exact location of every
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stairwell</ENAMEX> in their workplace. In addition, they should have access at all times to
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">flashlights</ENAMEX>, which were deemed invaluable by some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> who managed to evacuate
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTC</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 11</TIMEX>.
            Challenges Experienced by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Responders</ENAMEX>
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Challenge of Incident Command</ENAMEX>.
            
            As noted above, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 2001</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mayor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giuliani</ENAMEX> updated a directive titled "Direction
                and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Control of Emergencies in the City</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>." The directive designated, for
                different types of emergencies, an appropriate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> as "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Incident Commander"</ENAMEX>; it
                would be "responsible for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">City</ENAMEX>'s response to the emergency."
                The directive also provided that where incidents are "so multifaceted that no one
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agency</ENAMEX> immediately stands out as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Incident</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Commander</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OEM</ENAMEX> will assign the role of
                Incident <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Commander</ENAMEX> to an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> as the situation demands."
            
            To some degree, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mayor</ENAMEX>'s directive for incident command was followed on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX>. It
                was clear that the lead response <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX>, and that the other responding
                local, federal, bistate, and state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> acted in a supporting role. There was a
                tacit understanding that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> would have primary responsibility for
                evacuating <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> who were above the ground floors of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Twin Towers</ENAMEX>, while NYPD
                and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAPD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> would be in charge of evacuating <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> from the WTC complex
                once they reached ground level. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYPD</ENAMEX> also greatly assisted responding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">units</ENAMEX>
                by clearing emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTC</ENAMEX>.
            
            In addition, coordination occurred at high levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">command</ENAMEX>. For example, the Mayor
                and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Police</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Commissioner</ENAMEX> consulted with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Chief of the</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of the FDNY</ENAMEX> at
                <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9</TIMEX>:<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>. There were other instances of coordination at operational
                levels, and information was shared on an ad hoc basis. For example, an NYPD ESU team
                passed the news of their evacuation order to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">firefighters</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North Tower</ENAMEX>.
            
            It is also clear, however, that the response operations lacked the kind of integrated
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">communications</ENAMEX> and unified command contemplated in the directive. These problems
                existed both within and among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> responding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Command</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control</ENAMEX> within <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Responder Agencies</ENAMEX>.
            
            For a unified incident management system to succeed, each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participant</ENAMEX> must have
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">command</ENAMEX> and control of its own <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> and adequate internal communications. This was
                not always the case at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTC</ENAMEX> on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX>.
            Understandably lacking experience in responding to events of the magnitude of the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Trade Center</ENAMEX> attacks, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX> as an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX> proved incapable of
                coordinating the numbers of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> dispatched to different points within the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">16-acre</NUMEX>
                complex. As a result, numerous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> were congregating in the undamaged <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marriott</ENAMEX>
                Hotel and at the overall command post on West Street by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:30</TIMEX>, while <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chiefs</ENAMEX> in charge
                of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">South Tower</ENAMEX> still were in desperate need of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>. With better understanding
                of the resources already available, additional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> might not have been dispatched
                to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">South Tower</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:37</TIMEX>. The task of accounting for and coordinating the units
                was rendered difficult, if not impossible, by internal communications breakdowns
                resulting from the limited capabilities of radios in the high-rise environment of
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTC</ENAMEX> and from confusion over which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> were assigned to which frequency.
                Furthermore, when the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">South Tower</ENAMEX> collapsed the overall FDNY command post ceased to
                operate, which compromised the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX>'s ability to understand the situation; an FDNY
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">marine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX>'s immediate radio communication to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX> dispatch that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South Tower</ENAMEX>
                had fully collapsed was not conveyed to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chiefs</ENAMEX> at the scene. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX>'s inability to
                coordinate and account for the different radio <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> that would be used in an
                emergency of this scale contributed to the early lack of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">South Tower</ENAMEX>,
                whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lobby chief</ENAMEX> initially could not communicate with anyone outside that
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tower</ENAMEX>.
            
            Though almost no one at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:50</TIMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 11</TIMEX> was contemplating an imminent total
                collapse of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TwinTowers</ENAMEX>, many <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> responders and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> were contemplating
                the possibility of imminent additional terrorist attacks throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York City</ENAMEX>.
                Had any such attacks occurred, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX>'s response would have been severely
                compromised by the concentration of so many of its off-duty <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX>, particularly
                its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elite personnel</ENAMEX>, at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTC</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PortAuthority</ENAMEX>'s response was hampered by the
                lack of both standard operating procedures and radios capable of enabling multiple
                commands to respond in unified fashion to an incident at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTC</ENAMEX>. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX>
                reporting from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tunnel</ENAMEX> and airport commands could not hear instructions being
                issued over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTC Command</ENAMEX> frequency. In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">command</ENAMEX> and control was
                complicated by senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Port Authority Police</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> becoming directly involved in
                frontline rescue operations.
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYPD</ENAMEX> experienced comparatively fewer internal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">command</ENAMEX> and control and
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">communications</ENAMEX> issues. Because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> has a history of mobilizing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX>
                of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> for major events requiring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crowd</ENAMEX> control, its technical radio capability
                and major incident protocols were more easily adapted to an incident of the
                magnitude of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX>. In addition, its mission <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that day</TIMEX> lay largely outside the towers
                themselves. Although there were <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESU</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> and a few individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police officers</ENAMEX>
                climbing in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">towers</ENAMEX>, the vast majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYPD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> were staged outside,
                assisting with crowd control and evacuation and securing other sites in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX>.
                The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYPD ESU</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX> had firm command and control over its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>, in part because
                there were so few of them (in comparison to the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>) and all
                reported to the same <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESU</ENAMEX> command post. It is unclear, however, whether non-ESU NYPD
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> operating on the ground floors, and in a few cases on upper floors, of the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WTC</ENAMEX> were as well coordinated.
            Significant shortcomings within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">command</ENAMEX> and control capabilities were
                painfully exposed on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 11</TIMEX>. To its great credit, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> has made a
                substantial effort in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past three years</TIMEX> to address these. While significant
                problems in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">command</ENAMEX> and control of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAPD</ENAMEX> also were exposed on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 11</TIMEX>,
                it is less clear that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Port Authority</ENAMEX> has adopted new training exercises or major
                incident protocols to address these shortcomings.
            
            Lack of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Coordination</ENAMEX> among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Responder Agencies</ENAMEX>. Any attempt to establish a
                unified command on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9/11</TIMEX> would have been further frustrated by the lack of
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">communication</ENAMEX> and coordination among responding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>. Certainly, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX> was
                not "responsible for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">City</ENAMEX>'s response to the emergency," as the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mayor</ENAMEX>'s directive would have required. The command posts were in different
                locations, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OEM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX>, which could have served as a focal point for
                information sharing, did not play an integrating role in ensuring that information
                was shared among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9/11</TIMEX>, even prior to its evacuation. There was a lack of
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comprehensive</ENAMEX> coordination between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYPD</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAPD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> climbing above the
                ground floors in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Twin Towers</ENAMEX>.
            Information that was critical to informed decisionmaking was not shared among
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chiefs</ENAMEX> in leadership roles <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">that morning</TIMEX> have told us that their
                decision making capability was hampered by a lack of information from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYPD</ENAMEX> aviation.
                At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:51 A.M.</TIMEX>, a helicopter <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot</ENAMEX> cautioned that "large pieces" of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South Tower</ENAMEX>
                appeared to be about to fall and could pose a danger to those below. Immediately
                after the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX>'s collapse, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">helicopter</ENAMEX> pilot radioed that news. This transmission
                was followed by communications at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10:08, 10:15</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10:22</TIMEX> that called into question
                the condition of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North Tower</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chiefs</ENAMEX> would have benefited greatly had
                they been able to communicate with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">helicopter</ENAMEX>.
            The consequence of the lack of real-time intelligence from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYPD</ENAMEX> aviation should not
                be overstated. Contrary to a widely held misperception, no NYPD <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">helicopter</ENAMEX> predicted
                the fall of either <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tower</ENAMEX> before the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">South Tower</ENAMEX> collapsed, and no NYPD personnel
                began to evacuate the WTC complex prior to that time. Furthermore, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX>, as an
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">institution</ENAMEX>, was in possession of the knowledge that the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">South Tower</ENAMEX> had collapsed
                as early as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYPD</ENAMEX>, as its fall had been immediately reported by an <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">FDNY</ENAMEX> boat on a
                dispatch <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX>. Because of internal breakdowns within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX>, however,
                this information was not disseminated to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> on the scene.
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAPD</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYPD</ENAMEX> did not coordinate their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> that were searching the WTC
                complex for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX>. In many cases, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">redundant</ENAMEX> searches of specific floors and
                <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">areas</ENAMEX> were conducted. It is unclear whether fewer <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> responders in the aggregate
                would have been in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Twin Towers</ENAMEX> if there had been an integrated response, or what
                impact, if any, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">redundant</ENAMEX> searches had on the total number of <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> responder
                fatalities.
            Whether the lack of coordination between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYPD</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 11</TIMEX> had a
                catastrophic effect has been the subject of controversy. We believe that there are
                too many variables for us to responsibly quantify those consequences. It is clear
                that the lack of coordination did not affect adversely the evacuation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX>.
                It is equally clear, however, that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Incident Command System</ENAMEX> did not function to
                integrate awareness among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> or to facilitate interagency response.
            
            If <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> and other major <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> are to be prepared for future terrorist attacks,
                different first responder <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> within each <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> must be fully coordinated, just
                as different <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branches</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">military</ENAMEX> are. Coordination entails a unified
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">command</ENAMEX> that comprehensively deploys all dispatched <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX>, fire, and other first
                responder resources.
            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 2004</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York City</ENAMEX> adopted an emergency response plan that expressly
                contemplates <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> or more <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> jointly being lead <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> when responding to a
                terrorist attack but does not mandate a comprehensive and unified incident command
                that can deploy and monitor all <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> responder resources from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> overall command
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">post</ENAMEX>. In our judgment, this falls short of an optimal response plan, which requires
                clear <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">command</ENAMEX> and control, common training, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">trust</ENAMEX> that such training
                creates. The experience of the military suggests that integrated into such a
                coordinated response should be a unified field intelligence <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX>, which should
                receive and combine information from all <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> responders-including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">911</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operators</ENAMEX>.
                Such a field intelligence <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> could be valuable in large and complex incidents.
            Radio <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Communication Challenges: The Effectiveness and Urgency of</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Evacuation Instructions</ENAMEX>.
            
            As discussed above, the location of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYPD ESU</ENAMEX> command post was crucial in making
                possible an urgent evacuation order explaining the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">South Tower</ENAMEX>'s full collapse.
                Firefighters most certainly would have benefited from that information.
            A separate matter is the varied success at conveying evacuation instructions to
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North Tower</ENAMEX> after the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">South Tower</ENAMEX>'s collapse. The success of NYPD
                ESU instruction is attributable to a combination of (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) the strength of the radios,
                (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) the relatively small numbers of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> using them, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) use of the
                correct <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> by all.
            The same <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> factors worked against successful communication among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX>.
                First, the radios' effectiveness was drastically reduced in the high-rise
                environment. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, tactical channel <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1</TIMEX> was simply overwhelmed by the number of
                units attempting to communicate on it at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10:00</TIMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">firefighters</ENAMEX> were on the
                wrong <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> or simply lacked radios altogether. It is impossible to know what
                difference it made that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North Tower</ENAMEX> were not using the repeater channel
                after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10:00</TIMEX>. While the repeater <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> was at least partially operational before
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">South Tower</ENAMEX> collapsed, we do not know whether it continued to be operational
                after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:59</TIMEX>. Even without the repeater <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 24</NUMEX> of the at most <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> who were dispatched to and actually in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North Tower</ENAMEX> received the
                evacuation instruction-either via radio or directly from other <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> responders.
                Nevertheless, many of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">firefighters</ENAMEX> died, either because they delayed their
                evacuation to assist <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX>, attempted to regroup their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>, lacked urgency, or
                some combination of these factors. In addition, many other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">firefighters</ENAMEX> not
                dispatched to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North Tower</ENAMEX> also died in its collapse. Some had their radios on
                the wrong <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX>. Others were off-duty and lacked radios. In view of these
                considerations, we conclude that the technical failure of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX> radios, while a
                contributing factor, was not the primary cause of the many firefighter fatalities in
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North Tower</ENAMEX>.
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX> has worked hard in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past several years</TIMEX> to address its radio deficiencies.
                To improve radio capability in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">high-rises</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX> has internally developed a "post
                radio" that is small enough for a battalion <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> to carry to the upper floors and
                that greatly repeats and enhances radio signal strength.
            
            The story with respect to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Port Authority</ENAMEX> police <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NorthTower</ENAMEX> is less
                complicated; most of them lacked access to the radio <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> on which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Port</ENAMEX>
                Authority police evacuation order was given. Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 11</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Port Authority</ENAMEX>
                has worked hard to integrate the radio <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">systems</ENAMEX> of their different commands.
            The lesson of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">9/11</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> responders can be stated simply: in the
                new age of terror, they-we-are the primary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX>. The losses <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> suffered that
                day demonstrated both the gravity of the terrorist threat and the commensurate need
                to prepare ourselves to meet it.
            The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> responders of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> live in a world transformed by the attacks on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX>.
                Because no one believes that every conceivable form of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">attack</ENAMEX> can be prevented,
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> responders will again find themselves on the front lines. We
                must plan for that eventuality. A rededication to preparedness is perhaps the best
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> to honor the memories of those we lost <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that day</TIMEX>.
