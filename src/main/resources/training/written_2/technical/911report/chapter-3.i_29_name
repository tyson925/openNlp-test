            In <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">chapter 2</ENAMEX>, we described the growth of a new kind of terrorism, and a new terrorist
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX>-especially from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988 to 1998</TIMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Usama Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> declared war and
                organized the bombing of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">embassies</ENAMEX>. In this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX>, we trace the parallel
                evolution of government efforts to counter terrorism by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Islamic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">extremists</ENAMEX> against
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>.
            We mention many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personalities</ENAMEX> in this report. As in any study of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>,
                some of the most important <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institutions</ENAMEX>. We will introduce various
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agencies</ENAMEX>, and how they adapted to a new kind of terrorism.
            FROM THE <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OLD TERRORISM</ENAMEX> TO THE <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEW</ENAMEX>: THE <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FIRST WORLD TRADE CENTER</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BOMBING</ENAMEX>
            At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">18 minutes</TIMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">noon</TIMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February 26,1993</TIMEX>, a huge <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bomb</ENAMEX> went off beneath the two
                towers of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Trade Center</ENAMEX>. This was not a suicide attack. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX>
                parked a truck <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bomb</ENAMEX> with a timing device on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Level B-2</ENAMEX> of the underground <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">garage</ENAMEX>,
                then departed. The ensuing explosion opened a hole <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> stories up. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Six</NUMEX> people
                died. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">More than a thousand</NUMEX> were injured. An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> at the scene described the
                relatively low number of fatalities as a miracle.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Clinton</ENAMEX> ordered his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Security Council</ENAMEX> to coordinate the
                response. Government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> swung into action to find the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">culprits</ENAMEX>. The
                <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Counterterrorist Center</ENAMEX> located at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> combed its files and queried sources
                around the world. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Security Agency</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSA</ENAMEX>), the huge <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense Department</ENAMEX>
                signals collection <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>, ramped up its communications intercept <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> and
                searched its databases for clues.
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Field Office of the FBI</ENAMEX> took control of the local investigation and, in
                the end, set a pattern for future <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> of terrorist incidents.
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> features of this episode have significance for the story of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX>. First, the
                bombing signaled a new terrorist challenge, one whose rage and malice had no limit.
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ramzi Yousef</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sunni</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">extremist</ENAMEX> who planted the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bomb</ENAMEX>, said later that he had hoped
                to kill <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>.
            
            <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX> did excellent work investigating the
                bombing. Within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> identified a truck remnant as part of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ryder</ENAMEX> rental
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">van</ENAMEX> reported stolen in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jersey City</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX> before the bombing.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mohammed Salameh</ENAMEX>, who had rented the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">truck</ENAMEX> and reported it stolen, kept calling the
                rental <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> to get back his <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$400</NUMEX> deposit. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> arrested him there on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 4</TIMEX>,
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>. In short order, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bureau</ENAMEX> had several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">plotters</ENAMEX> in custody, including <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nidal</ENAMEX>
                Ayyad, an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineer</ENAMEX> who had acquired <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemicals</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bomb</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mahmoud Abouhalima</ENAMEX>,
                who had helped mix the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemicals</ENAMEX>.
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> identified another conspirator, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ahmad Ajaj</ENAMEX>, who had been arrested by
                immigration <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">John F. Kennedy International Airport</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 1992</TIMEX>
                and charged with document fraud. His traveling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">companion</ENAMEX> was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ramzi Yousef</ENAMEX>, who had
                also entered with fraudulent documents but claimed political asylum and was
                admitted. It quickly became clear that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yousef</ENAMEX> had been a central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">player</ENAMEX> in the
                attack. He had fled to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> immediately after the bombing and would remain at
                large for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nearly two years</TIMEX>.
            
            The arrests of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salameh, Abouhalima</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ayyad</ENAMEX> led the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Farouq</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX> in
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brooklyn</ENAMEX>, where a central figure was <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sheikh</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Omar Abdel Rahman</ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">extremist</ENAMEX> Sunni
                <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cleric</ENAMEX> who had moved to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX>. In speeches and
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">writings</ENAMEX>, the sightless <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rahman</ENAMEX>, often called the "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Blind Sheikh</ENAMEX>," preached the
                message of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sayyid Qutb's Milestones</ENAMEX>, characterizing the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> as the
                oppressor of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslims</ENAMEX> worldwide and asserting that it was their religious duty to
                fight against God's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enemies</ENAMEX>. An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> informant learned of a plan to bomb major <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">York</ENAMEX> landmarks, including the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Holland</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lincoln</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tunnels</ENAMEX>. Disrupting this
                "landmarks plot," the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 1993</TIMEX> arrested <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Rahman</ENAMEX> and various
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">confederates</ENAMEX>.
            
            As a result of the investigations and arrests, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Attorney</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern</ENAMEX>
                District of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> prosecuted and convicted multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ajaj</ENAMEX>,
                Salameh, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ayyad, Abouhalima, the Blind Sheikh</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ramzi Yousef</ENAMEX>, for crimes related
                to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Trade Center</ENAMEX> bombing and other plots. An unfortunate consequence of
                this superb investigative and prosecutorial effort was that it created an impression
                that the law enforcement system was well-equipped to cope with terrorism. Neither
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>, his principal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisers</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>, nor the news media felt
                prompted, until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later</TIMEX>, to press the question of whether the procedures that put the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blind Sheikh</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ramzi Yousef</ENAMEX> behind bars would really protect <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> against the
                new virus of which these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> were just the first symptoms.
            
            <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, the successful use of the legal system to address the first <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Trade Center</ENAMEX>
                bombing had the side effect of obscuring the need to examine the character and
                extent of the new threat facing the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. The trials did not bring the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bin</ENAMEX>
                Ladin network to the attention of the public and policymakers.
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> assembled, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Attorney</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> put forward, some evidence showing
                that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">dock</ENAMEX> were not the only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">plotters</ENAMEX>. Materials taken from Ajaj
                indicated that the plot or plots were hatched at or near the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Khaldan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camp</ENAMEX>, a
                terrorist training <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camp</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> border. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ajaj</ENAMEX> had left <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> in
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 1992</TIMEX> to go there to learn how to construct bombs. He had met <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ramzi Yousef</ENAMEX> in
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>, where they discussed bombing targets in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> and assembled a
                "terrorist kit" that included <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bomb</ENAMEX>-making manuals, operations guidance, videotapes
                advocating terrorist action against the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, and false identification
                    documents.
            
            Yousef was captured in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> following the discovery by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philippines</ENAMEX>
                in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 1995</TIMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manila</ENAMEX> air plot, which envisioned placing bombs on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> a
                dozen <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">trans-Pacific</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">airliners</ENAMEX> and setting them off simultaneously. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Khalid</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sheikh</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mohammed-Yousef</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">uncle</ENAMEX>, then located in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Qatar</ENAMEX>-was a fellow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">plotter</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yousef 's</ENAMEX> in
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manila</ENAMEX> air plot and had also wired him some money prior to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Trade Center</ENAMEX>
                bombing. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Attorney</ENAMEX> obtained an indictment against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 1996</TIMEX>, but
                an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qatar</ENAMEX> probably warned him about it. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Khalid</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sheikh</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mohammed</ENAMEX> evaded capture (and stayed at large to play a central part in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 9/11</TIMEX>
                attacks)<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.10</NUMEX> The law enforcement process is concerned with proving the guilt of
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons apprehended</ENAMEX> and charged. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Investigators</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutors</ENAMEX> could not present all
                the evidence of possible involvement of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> other than those charged,
                although they continued to pursue such investigations, planning or hoping for later
                prosecutions. The process was meant, by its nature, to mark for the public the
                events as finished-case solved, justice done. It was not designed to ask if the
                events might be harbingers of worse to come. Nor did it allow for aggregating and
                analyzing facts to see if they could provide clues to terrorist tactics more
                generally-methods of entry and finance, and mode of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX> inside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX>.
            <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Fourth</NUMEX>, although the bombing heightened awareness of a new terrorist danger,
                successful prosecutions contributed to widespread underestimation of the threat. The
                government's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorneys</ENAMEX> stressed the seriousness of the crimes, and put forward
                evidence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yousef</ENAMEX> 's technical ingenuity. Yet the public image that persisted was
                not of clever <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yousef</ENAMEX> but of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stupid</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salameh</ENAMEX> going back again and again to reclaim his
                <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$400</NUMEX> truck rental deposit.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">ADAPTATION-AND NONADAPTATION-IN THE LAW ENFORCEMENT COMMUNITY</ENAMEX>
            Legal processes were the primary method for responding to these early manifestations
                of a new type of terrorism. Our overview of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> capabilities for dealing with it
                thus begins with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s vast complex of law enforcement <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>.
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> At the federal level, much law enforcement
                activity is concentrated in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Justice</ENAMEX>. For countering terrorism, the
                dominant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> under <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Bureau of Investigation</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> does
                not have a general grant of authority but instead works under specific statutory
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">authorizations</ENAMEX>. Most of its work is done in local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> called field <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>.
                There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">56</NUMEX> of them, each covering a specified geographic area, and each quite
                separate from all others. Prior to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX>, the special <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> in charge was in general
                free to set his or her <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>'s priorities and assign personnel accordingly.
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>'s priorities were driven by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> primary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concerns</ENAMEX>. First, performance in
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bureau</ENAMEX> was generally measured against statistics such as numbers of arrests,
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">indictments</ENAMEX>, prosecutions, and convictions. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Counterterrorism</ENAMEX> and counterintelligence
                work, often involving lengthy intelligence investigations that might never have
                positive or quantifiable results, was not career-enhancing. Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> who reached
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management ranks</ENAMEX> had little counterterrorism experience. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, priorities were
                driven at the local level by the field <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>, whose <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concerns</ENAMEX> centered on
                traditional crimes such as white-collar <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">offenses</ENAMEX> and those pertaining to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> and
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gangs</ENAMEX>. Individual field <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> made choices to serve local priorities, not national
                    priorities.
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bureau</ENAMEX> also operates under an "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> of origin" system. To avoid duplication and
                possible conflicts, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> designates a single <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> to be in charge of an entire
                investigation. Because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Field Office</ENAMEX> indicted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> prior to the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">East Africa</ENAMEX> bombings, it became the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> of origin for all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> cases,
                including the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Africa</ENAMEX> bombings and later the attack on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">USS Cole</ENAMEX>. Most of the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>'s institutional knowledge on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> resided there. This office
                worked closely with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Attorney</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southern District of New York</ENAMEX> to
                identify, arrest, prosecute, and convict many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">perpetrators</ENAMEX> of the attacks and
                plots. Field <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> other than the specified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> of origin were often reluctant
                to spend much energy on matters over which they had no control and for which they
                received no credit.
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>'s domestic intelligence gathering dates from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1930s</TIMEX>. With <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX>
                looming, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Franklin D. Roosevelt</ENAMEX> ordered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">J. Edgar Hoover</ENAMEX> to

                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hoover</ENAMEX> added investigation of possible espionage, sabotage, or subversion to the
                duties of field <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>. After the war, foreign intelligence duties were assigned to
                the newly established <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central Intelligence Agency</ENAMEX>. Hoover jealously guarded the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>'s domestic portfolio against all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">rivals</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hoover</ENAMEX> felt he was accountable only to
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>'s domestic intelligence activities kept growing. In the
                1960s, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> was receiving significant assistance within the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> from
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> and from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Army Intelligence</ENAMEX>. The legal basis for some of this assistance was
                dubious.
            Decades of encouragement to perform as a domestic intelligence <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> abruptly ended
                in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1970s</TIMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Two years</TIMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hoover</ENAMEX>'s death in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1972</TIMEX>, congresCOUNTERTERRORISM
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sional</ENAMEX> and news media investigations of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Watergate</ENAMEX> scandals of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nixon</ENAMEX>
                administration expanded into general investigations of foreign and domestic
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intelligence</ENAMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Church</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pike</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committees</ENAMEX>.
            
            They disclosed domestic intelligence efforts, which included a covert action program
                that operated from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1956 to 1971</TIMEX> against domestic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> and, eventually,
                domestic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dissidents</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> had spied on a wide range of political <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">figures</ENAMEX>,
                especially <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> whom <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hoover</ENAMEX> wanted to discredit (notably the Reverend <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Luther King, Jr.</ENAMEX>), and had authorized unlawful wiretaps and surveillance. The shock
                registered in public opinion polls, where the percentage of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> declaring a
                "highly favorable" view of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> dropped from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">84 percent to 37 percent</NUMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>'s
                Domestic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelligence Division</ENAMEX> was dissolved.
            
            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1976</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Attorney General</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward Levi</ENAMEX> adopted domestic security guidelines to
                regulate intelligence collection in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> and to deflect calls for even
                stronger regulation. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1983</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Attorney General</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William French Smith</ENAMEX> revised the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Levi</ENAMEX>
                guidelines to encourage closer investigation of potential terrorism. He also
                loosened the rules governing authorization for investigations and their duration.
                Still, his guidelines, like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Levi's</ENAMEX>, took account of the reality that suspicion of
                "terrorism," like suspicion of "subversion," could lead to making <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>
                targets for investigation more because of their beliefs than because of their acts.
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX>'s guidelines also took account of the reality that potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX> were
                often <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">extremist</ENAMEX> religious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> and that investigation of
                terrorism could cross the line separating state and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">church</ENAMEX>.
            
            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> authorized the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> to investigate terrorist attacks against
                <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> that occur outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Three years later</TIMEX>, it added
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">authority</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> to make arrests abroad without consent from the host <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>.
                Meanwhile, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">task force</ENAMEX> headed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George H.W. Bush</ENAMEX> had endorsed a
                concept already urged by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central Intelligence</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Casey</ENAMEX>-a
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Counterterrorist Center</ENAMEX>, where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>, and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> could work
                together on international terrorism. While it was distinctly a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>
                detailed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> to work at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center</ENAMEX> and obtained leads that helped in the
                capture of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> wanted for trial in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>.
            The strengths that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> brought to counterterrorism were nowhere more brilliantly
                on display than in the case of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan American</ENAMEX> Flight 103, bound from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">York</ENAMEX>, which blew up over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lockerbie</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Scotland</ENAMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 1988</TIMEX>, killing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">270</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>.
                Initial evidence pointed to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Syria</ENAMEX> and, later, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX>. The
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Counterterrorist Center</ENAMEX> reserved judgment on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">perpetrators</ENAMEX> of the attack.
                Meanwhile, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">technicians</ENAMEX>, working with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.K.</ENAMEX> security services, gathered and
                analyzed the widely scattered fragments of the airliner. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX>, with the help of
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Counterterrorist Center</ENAMEX>, they identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> small fragment as part of a timing
                device-to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">technicians</ENAMEX>, as distinctive as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>. It was a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Libyan</ENAMEX> device. Together
                with other evidence, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> put together a case pointing conclusively to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Libyan</ENAMEX>
                government. Eventually <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Libya</ENAMEX> acknowledged its responsibility.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan Am</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">103</NUMEX> became a cautionary tale against rushing to judgment in attributing
                responsibility for a terrorist act. It also showed again how-given a case to
                solve-the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> remained capable of extraordinary investigative success.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI Organization</ENAMEX> and Priorities In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> chose <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis Freeh</ENAMEX> as the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bureau</ENAMEX>. Freeh, who would remain <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX> until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 2001</TIMEX>, believed
                that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>'s work should be done primarily by the field <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>. To emphasize this
                view he cut headquarters <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> and decentralized operations. The special <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> in
                charge gained power, influence, and independence.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Freeh</ENAMEX> recognized terrorism as a major threat. He increased the number of legal
                attach� <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> abroad, focusing in particular on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Middle East</ENAMEX>. He also urged
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> not to wait for terrorist acts to occur before taking action. In his first
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">budget</ENAMEX> request to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> after the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Trade Center</ENAMEX> bombing, he stated that
                "merely solving this type of crime is not enough; it is equally important that the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> thwart terrorism before such acts can be perpetrated." Within <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX>, he
                created a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Counterterrorism Division</ENAMEX> that would complement the Counterterrorist
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> and arranged for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchanges</ENAMEX> of senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> counterterrorism
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>. He pressed for more cooperation between legal attach�s and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> stations
                    abroad.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Freeh</ENAMEX>'s efforts did not, however, translate into a significant shift of resources to
                counterterrorism. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office of Management and Budget</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> said
                that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> seemed unwilling to shift resources to terrorism from other
                areas such as violent crime and drug enforcement; other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> blamed
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OMB</ENAMEX> for a lack of political will and failure to understand the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>'s counterterrorism resource needs. In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Freeh</ENAMEX> did not impose his views
                on the field <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>. With a few notable exceptions, the field <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> did not apply
                significant resources to terrorism and often reprogrammed funds for other
                    priorities.
            
            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> issued a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five-year</TIMEX> strategic plan led by its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">deputy director</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Robert</ENAMEX>
                "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bear</ENAMEX>" <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bryant</ENAMEX>. For the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> designated national and economic
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">security</ENAMEX>, including counterterrorism, as its top priority. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dale Watson</ENAMEX>, who would
                later become the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Counterterrorism Division</ENAMEX>, said that after the East
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Africa</ENAMEX> bombings,"the light came on" that cultural change had to occur within the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>. The plan mandated a stronger intelligence collection effort. It called for a
                nationwide automated system to facilitate information collection, analysis, and
                dissemination. It envisioned the creation of a professional intelligence <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cadre</ENAMEX> of
                experienced and trained <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX>. If successfully implemented, this would
                have been a major step toward addressing terrorism systematically, rather than as
                individual unrelated cases. But the plan did not succeed.
            
            First, the plan did not obtain the necessary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human resources</ENAMEX>. Despite
                desCOUNTERTERRORISM
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ignating</ENAMEX> "national and economic security" as its top priority in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> did
                not shift <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human resources</ENAMEX> accordingly. Although the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>'s counterterrorism budget
                tripled during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-1990s</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> counterterrorism spending remained fairly constant
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between fiscal years 1998 and 2001</TIMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>, there were still twice as many agents
                devoted to drug enforcement as to counterterrorism.
            
            <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX> intended to strengthen the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>'s strategic analysis
                capability faltered. It received insufficient resources and faced resistance from
                senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>'s operational <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">divisions</ENAMEX>. The new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX> was supposed to
                identify trends in terrorist activity, determine what the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> did not know, and
                ultimately drive collection efforts. However, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> had little appreciation for
                the role of analysis. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> continued to be used primarily in a tactical
                fashion-providing support for existing cases. Compounding the problem was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>'s
                tradition of hiring <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> from within instead of recruiting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> with the
                relevant educational background and expertise.
            
            Moreover, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> had difficulty getting access to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> and intelligence
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">community</ENAMEX> information they were expected to analyze. The poor <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>'s
                information systems meant that such access depended in large part on an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX>'s
                personal relationships with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> in the operational <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">squads</ENAMEX> where the
                information resided. For all of these reasons, prior to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX> relatively few
                strategic analytic reports about counterterrorism had been completed. Indeed, the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> had never completed an assessment of the overall terrorist threat to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">homeland</ENAMEX>.
            
            <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> did not have an effective intelligence collection effort. Collection
                of intelligence from human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> was limited, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> were inadequately
                trained. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Only three days</TIMEX> of a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16-week</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">course</ENAMEX> were devoted to
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">counterintelligence</ENAMEX> and counterterrorism, and most subsequent training was received
                on the job. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> did not have an adequate mechanism for validating source
                reporting, nor did it have a system for adequately tracking and sharing source
                reporting, either internally or externally. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> did not dedicate sufficient
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX> to the surveillance and translation needs of counterterrorism <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>. It
                lacked sufficient translators proficient in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Arabic</ENAMEX> and other key languages,
                resulting in a significant backlog of untranslated intercepts.
            
            Finally, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>'s information systems were woefully inadequate. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> lacked the
                ability to know what it knew: there was no effective mechanism for capturing or
                sharing its institutional knowledge. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> did create records of interviews and
                other investigative efforts, but there were no reports <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> to condense the
                information into meaningful intelligence that could be retrieved and
                    disseminated.
            
            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> created separate Counterterrorism and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Counterintelligence</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">divisions</ENAMEX>.
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dale Watson</ENAMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Counterterrorism Division</ENAMEX>, recognized the
                urgent need to increase the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>'s counterterrorism capability. His plan, called
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAXCAP</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">05</TIMEX>, was unveiled in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>: it set the goal of bringing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bureau</ENAMEX> to its
                "maximum feasible capacity" in counterterrorism by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2005</TIMEX>. Field <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX> told
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Watson</ENAMEX> that they did not have the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX>, linguists, or technically trained
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> to carry out the strategy. In a report provided to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Mueller</ENAMEX>
                in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 2001</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one year</TIMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Watson</ENAMEX> presented his plan to field <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executives</ENAMEX>,
                almost every <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> field <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> was assessed to be operating below "maximum capacity."
                The report stated that "the goal to 'prevent terrorism' requires a dramatic shift in
                emphasis from a reactive capability to highly functioning intelligence capability
                which provides not only leads and operational support, but clear strategic analysis
                and direction."
            
            Legal Constraints on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> and "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">the Wall" The FBI</ENAMEX> had different tools for law
                enforcement and intelligence.
            
            For criminal matters, it could apply for and use traditional criminal warrants. For
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intelligence</ENAMEX> matters involving international terrorism, however, the rules were
                different. For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many years</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney general</ENAMEX> could authorize surveillance of
                foreign powers and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> of foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">powers</ENAMEX> without any court review, but in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1978</TIMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> passed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Foreign Intelligence Surveillance</ENAMEX> Act<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.29</NUMEX>This law regulated
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intelligence</ENAMEX> collection directed at foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">powers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> of foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">powers</ENAMEX> in
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. In addition to requiring court review of proposed surveillance
                (and later, physical searches), the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1978</TIMEX> act was interpreted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">courts</ENAMEX> to
                require that a search be approved only if its "primary purpose" was to obtain
                foreign intelligence information. In other words, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FISA</ENAMEX> law
                could not be used to circumvent traditional criminal warrant requirements. The
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX> interpreted these rulings as saying that criminal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutors</ENAMEX>
                could be briefed on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FISA</ENAMEX> information but could not direct or control its
                    collection.
            
            Throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1980s</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 1990s</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutors</ENAMEX> had informal arrangements
                for obtaining information gathered in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FISA</ENAMEX> process, the understanding being that
                they would not improperly exploit that process for their criminal cases. Whether the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> shared with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutors</ENAMEX> information pertinent to possible criminal
                investigations was left solely to the judgment of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>.
            
            But the prosecution of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aldrich Ames</ENAMEX> for espionage in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX> revived concerns about the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutors</ENAMEX>' role in intelligence investigations. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Justice</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office</ENAMEX>
                of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelligence Policy and Review</ENAMEX> (OIPR) is responsible for reviewing and presenting
                all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FISA</ENAMEX> applications to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FISA Court</ENAMEX>. It worried that because of the numerous
                prior consultations between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutors</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> might rule that
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FISA</ENAMEX> warrants had been misused. If that had happened, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ames</ENAMEX> might have escaped
                conviction. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Scruggs</ENAMEX>, the acting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OIPR</ENAMEX>, complained to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Attorney General</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Janet Reno</ENAMEX> about the lack of information-sharing controls. On his own, he began
                imposing informationsharing procedures for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FISA</ENAMEX> material. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office of Intelligence</ENAMEX>
                Policy and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Review</ENAMEX> became the gatekeeper for the flow of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FISA</ENAMEX> information to criminal
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutors</ENAMEX>.
            
            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 1995</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Attorney General</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reno</ENAMEX> issued formal procedures aimed at managing
                information sharing between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutors</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>. They were
                developed in a working <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> led by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Executive Office of</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Security</ENAMEX>, overseen by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Deputy Attorney General</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jamie Gorelick</ENAMEX>.
            
            These procedures-while requiring the sharing of intelligence information with
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutors</ENAMEX>-regulated the manner in which such information could be shared from the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intelligence</ENAMEX> side of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> to the criminal side.
            These procedures were almost immediately misunderstood and misapplied. As a result,
                there was far less information sharing and coordination between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> and the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Criminal Division</ENAMEX> in practice than was allowed under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX>'s procedures.
                Over time the procedures came to be referred to as "the wall." The term "the wall"
                is misleading, however, because several factors led to a series of barriers to
                information sharing that developed.
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office of Intelligence Policy and Review</ENAMEX> became the sole gatekeeper for passing
                information to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Criminal Division</ENAMEX>. Though <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Attorney General</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reno</ENAMEX>'s procedures did
                not include such a provision, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office</ENAMEX> assumed the role anyway, arguing that its
                position reflected the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concerns</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Judge</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Royce Lamberth</ENAMEX>, then chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">judge</ENAMEX> of the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office</ENAMEX> threatened that if it could not
                regulate the flow of information to criminal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutors</ENAMEX>, it would no longer present
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>'s warrant requests to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FISA Court</ENAMEX>. The information flow withered.
            
            The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX> procedures dealt only with sharing between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> and criminal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutors</ENAMEX>,
                not between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> kinds of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>, those working on intelligence matters and those
                working on criminal matters. But pressure from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office of Intelligence Policy</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Review</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FISA Court</ENAMEX> built barriers between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>-even agents
                serving on the same <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">squads</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Deputy Director</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bryant</ENAMEX> reinforced the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office</ENAMEX>'s
                caution by informing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> that too much information sharing could be a career
                stopper. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Agents</ENAMEX> in the field began to believe-incorrectly-that no <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FISA</ENAMEX> information
                could be shared with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> working on criminal investigations.
            
            This perception evolved into the still more exaggerated belief that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> could not
                share any intelligence information with criminal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX>, even if no <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FISA</ENAMEX>
                procedures had been used. Thus, relevant information from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Security</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agency</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> often failed to make its way to criminal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX>. Separate
                reviews in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999, 2000</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX> concluded independently that information sharing was
                not occurring, and that the intent of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX> procedures was ignored
                    routinely.
            
            We will describe some of the unfortunate consequences of these accumulated
                institutional beliefs and practices in chapter 8.
            There were other legal limitations. Both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutors</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> argued that they
                were barred by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> rules from sharing grand jury information, even though the
                prohibition applied only to that small fraction that had been presented to a grand
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jury</ENAMEX>, and even that prohibition had exceptions. But as interpreted by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> field
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>, this prohibition could conceivably apply to much of the information
                unearthed in an investigation. There were also restrictions, arising from executive
                order, on the commingling of domestic information with foreign intelligence. Finally
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSA</ENAMEX> began putting caveats on its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>-related reports that required prior
                approval before sharing their contents with criminal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutors</ENAMEX>.
                These developments further blocked the arteries of information sharing.
            
            Other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Law Enforcement Agencies The Justice Department</ENAMEX> is much more than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>. It
                also has a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Marshals Service</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost 4,000</NUMEX> strong on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX> and especially expert
                in tracking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fugitives</ENAMEX>, with much local police knowledge. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drug</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enforcement Administration</ENAMEX> had, as of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 4,500</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>.
            
            There were a number of occasions when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> were able to introduce <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> to
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> for counterterrorism use.
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Immigration and Naturalization Service</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INS</ENAMEX>), with its <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Border Patrol</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,500</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inspectors</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,000</NUMEX> immigration special <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>, had perhaps the
                greatest potential to develop an expanded role in counterterrorism. However, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INS</ENAMEX>
                was focused on the formidable challenges posed by illegal entry over the southwest
                border, criminal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aliens</ENAMEX>, and a growing backlog in the applications for naturalizing
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX>, and above all the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>
                reinforced these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concerns</ENAMEX>. In addition, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Doris Meissner</ENAMEX> became <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INS Commissioner</ENAMEX>
                in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>, she found an agency seriously hampered by outdated technology and
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">insufficient human resources</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Border Patrol</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> were still using manual
                typewriters; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inspectors</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ports</ENAMEX> of entry were using a paper watchlist; the asylum
                and other benefits <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">systems</ENAMEX> did not effectively deter fraudulent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">applicants</ENAMEX>.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Commissioner</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Meissner</ENAMEX> responded in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Trade Center</ENAMEX> bombing by
                providing seed money to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Consular Affairs Bureau</ENAMEX> to automate
                its terrorist watchlist, used by consular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> and border <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inspectors</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INS</ENAMEX>
                assigned an individual in a new "lookout" <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> to work with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX> in
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">watchlisting</ENAMEX> suspected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX> and with the intelligence <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> in
                determining how to deal with them when they appeared at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ports</ENAMEX> of entry. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">97</NUMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">suspected</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX> had been denied admission at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ports</ENAMEX> of entry because of the
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">watchlist</ENAMEX>.
            
            How to conduct deportation cases against <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aliens</ENAMEX> who were suspected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX> caused
                significant debate. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INS</ENAMEX> had immigration law expertise and authority to bring the
                cases, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> possessed the classified information sometimes needed as
                evidence, and information-sharing conflicts resulted. New laws in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> authorized
                the use of classified evidence in removal hearings, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INS</ENAMEX> removed only a
                handful of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aliens</ENAMEX> with links to terrorist activity (none identified as
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>) using classified evidence.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Midlevel INS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> proposed comprehensive counterterrorism proCOUNTERTERRORISM
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">posals</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986, 1995</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>. No action was taken on them. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>, a
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Security</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Unit</ENAMEX> was set up to handle alerts, track potential terrorist cases
                for possible immigration enforcement action, and work with the rest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Department</ENAMEX>. It focused on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>'s priorities of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hezbollah</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hamas</ENAMEX>, and began to
                examine how immigration laws could be brought to bear on terrorism. For instance, it
                sought unsuccessfully to require that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> security checks be completed before
                naturalization applications were approved.
            
            Policy questions, such as whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">resident</ENAMEX> alien status should be revoked upon the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>'s conviction of a terrorist crime, were not addressed. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>, with the
                support of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>, doubled the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Border Patrol</ENAMEX> agents
                required along the border with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every quarter</TIMEX> mile by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>. It
                rejected efforts to bring additional resources to bear in the north. The border with
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> for every <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">13.25 miles</NUMEX>. Despite examples of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX> entering
                from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>, awareness of terrorist activity in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> and its more lenient
                immigration laws, and an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inspector general</ENAMEX>'s report recommending that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Border</ENAMEX>
                Patrol develop a northern border strategy, the only positive step was that the
                number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Border Patrol</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> was not cut any further.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Inspectors</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ports</ENAMEX> of entry were not asked to focus on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX>. Inspectors
                told us they were not even aware that when they checked the names of incoming
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> against the automated watchlist, they were checking in part for
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX>. In general, border <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inspectors</ENAMEX> also did not have the information they
                needed to make fact-based determinations of admissibility. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INS</ENAMEX> initiated but
                failed to bring to completion <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> efforts that would have provided <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inspectors</ENAMEX> with
                information relevant to counterterrorism-a proposed system to track foreign student
                visa compliance and a program to establish a way of tracking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">travelers</ENAMEX>' entry to and
                exit from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>.
            
            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>, a new law enabled the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INS</ENAMEX> to enter into agreements with state and local law
                enforcement <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> through which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INS</ENAMEX> provided training and the local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>
                exercised immigration enforcement <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authority</ENAMEX>. Terrorist watchlists were not available
                to them. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mayors</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> with large <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrant populations</ENAMEX> sometimes imposed limits
                on city <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX> cooperation with federal immigration <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>. A large population
                lives outside the legal framework. Fraudulent documents could be easily obtained.
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> kept the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> static in the face of the overwhelming
                    problem.
            
            The chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicle</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INS</ENAMEX> and for state and local participation in law enforcement
                was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joint Terrorism Task Force</ENAMEX> (JTTF), first tried out in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York City</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1980</TIMEX>
                in response to a spate of incidents involving domestic terrorist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>. This
                task <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> was managed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Field Office of the FBI</ENAMEX>, and its existence
                provided an opportunity to exchange information and, as happened after the first
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Trade Center</ENAMEX> bombing, to enlist local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX>, as well as other agency
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX>, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> investigation. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> expanded the number
                of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">JTTFs</ENAMEX> throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1990s</TIMEX>, and by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9/11</TIMEX> there were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</NUMEX>. While useful, the JTTFs
                had limitations. They set priorities in accordance with regional and field office
                concerns, and most were not fully staffed. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> and local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> believed
                they had little to gain from having a full-time <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> on a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JTTF</ENAMEX>.
            
            Other federal law enforcement resources, also not seriously enlisted for
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">counterterrorism</ENAMEX>, were to be found in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury Department</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX> housed the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Secret Service</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Customs Service</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco</ENAMEX>, and
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Firearms</ENAMEX>. Given the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Secret Service</ENAMEX>'s mission to protect the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> and other high
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>, its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> did become involved with those of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> whenever terrorist
                assassination plots were rumored. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Customs Service</ENAMEX> deployed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> at all points
                of entry into the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. Its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> worked alongside <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>, and the two
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> sometimes cooperated. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the winter of 1999-2000</TIMEX>, as will be detailed in
                <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">chapter 6</ENAMEX>, questioning by an especially alert <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Customs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inspector</ENAMEX> led to the arrest of
                an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorist</ENAMEX> whose apparent mission was to bomb <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Airport</ENAMEX>.
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms</ENAMEX> was used on occasion by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> as a
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resource</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATF</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratories</ENAMEX> and analysis were critical to the investigation of
                the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February 1993</TIMEX> bombing of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Trade Center</ENAMEX> and the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 1995</TIMEX> bombing of
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alfred P. Murrah</ENAMEX> Federal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Building</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oklahoma City</ENAMEX>.
            
            Before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9/11</TIMEX>, with the exception of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> portion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>, very little of the
                sprawling <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> law enforcement <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> was engaged in countering terrorism.
                Moreover, law enforcement could be effective only after specific <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> were
                identified, a plot had formed, or an attack had already occurred. Responsible
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> had to be located, apprehended, and transported back to a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> for
                prosecution. As <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> emphasized to us, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX> do
                not have cruise <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missiles</ENAMEX>. They declare war by indicting someone. They took on the
                lead role in addressing terrorism because they were asked to do so.
            
             . . . AND IN THE FEDERAL <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AVIATION ADMINISTRATION</ENAMEX>
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Aviation Administration</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>) within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Transportation</ENAMEX> had
                been vested by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> with the sometimes conflicting mandate of regulating the
                safety and security of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> civil aviation while also promoting the civil aviation
                industry. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> had a security mission to protect the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> of commercial air
                transportation against terrorism and other criminal acts. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years before 9/11</TIMEX>,
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> perceived sabotage as a greater threat to aviation than hijacking. First, no
                domestic hijacking had occurred in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a decade</TIMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, the commercial aviation system
                was perceived as more vulnerable to explosives than to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX> such as firearms.
                Finally, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">explosives</ENAMEX> were perceived as deadlier than hijacking and therefore of
                greater consequence. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>, a presidential <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">commission</ENAMEX> on aviation safety and
                security chaired by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Gore</ENAMEX> reinforced the prevailing concern about
                sabotage and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">explosives</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gore Commission</ENAMEX> also flagged, as a new
                danger, the possibility of attack by surface-to-air <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missiles</ENAMEX>. Its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997 final</TIMEX> report
                did not discuss the possibility of suicide hijackings.
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> set and enforced aviation security rules, which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">airlines</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airports</ENAMEX> were
                required to implement. The rules were supposed to produce a "layered" system of
                defense. This meant that the failure of any one layer of security would not be
                fatal, because additional layers would provide backup security. But each layer
                relevant to hijackings-intelligence, passenger <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">prescreening</ENAMEX>, checkpoint screening,
                and onboard security-was seriously flawed prior to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX>. Taken together, they did
                not stop any of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX> hijackers from getting on board <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> different <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> at
                <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> different <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airports</ENAMEX>.
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>'s policy was to use intelligence to identify both specific plots and general
                threats to civil aviation security, so that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> could develop and deploy
                appropriate countermeasures. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX>-person intelligence <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> was supposed to
                receive a broad range of intelligence data from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>, and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> so
                that it could make assessments about the threat to aviation. But the large volume of
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> contained little pertaining to the presence and activities of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX> in the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX>. For example, information on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>'s effort in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX> to assess the
                potential use of flight training by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phoenix</ENAMEX> electronic
                <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">communication of 2001</ENAMEX> warning of radical <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Middle Easterners</ENAMEX> attending flight school
                were not passed to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX>. Several top <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> intelligence <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> called
                the domestic threat picture a serious blind spot.
            
            Moreover, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>'s intelligence <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> did not receive much attention from the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agency</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX>. Neither <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Administrator</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jane Garvey</ENAMEX> nor her <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">deputy</ENAMEX> routinely
                reviewed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> intelligence, and what they did see was screened for them. She was
                unaware of a great amount of hijacking threat information from her own intelligence
                unit, which, in turn, was not deeply involved in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s policymaking process.
                Historically, decisive security action took place only after a disaster had occurred
                or a specific plot had been discovered.
            
            The next aviation security layer was passenger <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">prescreening</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> directed air
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carriers</ENAMEX> not to fly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> known to pose a "direct" threat to civil aviation.
                But as of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>'s "no-fly" list contained the names of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">just 12</NUMEX> terrorist
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">suspects</ENAMEX> (including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mastermind Khalid</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sheikh</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mohammed</ENAMEX>), even though government
                watchlists contained the names of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">many thousands</NUMEX> of known and suspected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX>.
                This astonishing mismatch existed despite the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gore Commission</ENAMEX>'s having called on the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four years earlier</TIMEX> to provide terrorist watchlists to improve
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prescreening</ENAMEX>. The longtime <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>'s civil aviation security division
                testified that he was not even aware of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX>'sTIPOFF list of known
                and suspected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 60,000</NUMEX> before <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX>) until he heard it mentioned
                during the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 26, 2004</TIMEX>, public hearing. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> had access to some
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TIPOFF</ENAMEX> data, but apparently found it too difficult to use.
            
            The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> part of prescreening called on the air <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carriers</ENAMEX> to implement an
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>-approved computerized algorithm (known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAPPS</ENAMEX>, for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Computer Assisted Passenger</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prescreening System</ENAMEX>) designed to identify <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> whose profile suggested they
                might pose more than a minimal risk to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>. Although the algorithm included
                hijacker profile data, at that time only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> checking bags were eligible to
                be selected by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAPPS</ENAMEX> for additional scrutiny. Selection entailed only having one's
                checked baggage screened for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">explosives</ENAMEX> or held off the airplane until one had
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">boarded</ENAMEX>. Primarily because of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> regarding potential discrimination and the
                impact on passenger <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">throughput</ENAMEX>, "selectees" were no longer required to undergo
                extraordinary screening of their carry-on baggage as had been the case before the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX> was computerized in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1997.55</NUMEX> This policy change also reflected the perception
                that nonsuicide sabotage was the primary threat to civil aviation.
            Checkpoint screening was considered the most important and obvious layer of security.
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Walk-through</ENAMEX> metal detectors and X-ray machines operated by trained <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">screeners</ENAMEX> were
                employed to stop prohibited items. Numerous government reports indicated that
                checkpoints performed poorly, often failing to detect even obvious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> test items.
                Many deadly and dangerous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">items</ENAMEX> did not set off metal detectors, or were hard to
                distinguish in an X-ray machine from innocent everyday items.
            
            While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> rules did not expressly prohibit knives with blades under <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4 inches</NUMEX> long,
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">airlines</ENAMEX>' checkpoint operations guide (which was developed in cooperation with
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>), explicitly permitted them. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>'s basis for this policy was (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agency</ENAMEX> did not consider such items to be menacing, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) most local laws did not
                prohibit <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> from carrying such knives, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) such knives would have been
                difficult to detect unless the sensitivity of metal detectors had been greatly
                increased. A proposal to ban <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">knives</ENAMEX> altogether in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX> had been rejected because
                small cutting implements were difficult to detect and the number of innocent
                "alarms" would have increased significantly, exacerbating congestion problems at
                    checkpoints.
            
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Several years</TIMEX> prior to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> requirement for screeners to conduct "continuous"
                and "random" hand searches of carry-on luggage at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">checkpoints</ENAMEX> had been replaced by
                explosive trace detection or had simply become ignored by the air <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carriers</ENAMEX>.
                Therefore, secondary screening of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> and their carry-on bags to identify
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">weapons</ENAMEX> (other than bombs) was nonexistent, except for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> who triggered the
                metal detectors. Even when small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">knives</ENAMEX> were detected by secondary screening, they
                were usually returned to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">traveler</ENAMEX>. Reportedly, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">9/11</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">hijackers</ENAMEX> were
                instructed to use items that would be undetectable by <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport checkpoints</ENAMEX>.
            
            In the pre-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX> security system, the air <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carriers</ENAMEX> played a major role. As the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Inspector General</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ofTransportation</ENAMEX> told us, there were great
                pressures from the air <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carriers</ENAMEX> to control security costs and to "limit the impact
                of security requirements on aviation <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX>, so that the industry could
                concentrate on its primary mission of moving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>. . . . [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>]hose
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">counterpressures</ENAMEX> in turn manifested themselves as significant weaknesses in
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">security</ENAMEX>." A longtime <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> described the air <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carriers</ENAMEX>' approach to
                security regulation as "decry, deny and delay" and told us that while "the air
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carriers</ENAMEX> had seen the enlightened hand of self-interest with respect to safety, they
                hadn't seen it in the security arena."
            
            The final layer, security on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>, was not designed to counter
                suicide hijackings. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>-approved "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Common Strategy</ENAMEX>" had been elaborated over
                decades of experience with scores of hijackings, beginning in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s</TIMEX>. It taught
                flight <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crews</ENAMEX> that the best way to deal with hijackers was to accommodate their
                demands, get the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> to land safely, and then let law enforcement or the military
                handle the situation. According to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>, the record had shown that the longer a
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hijacking</ENAMEX> persisted, the more likely it was to end peacefully. The strategy operated
                on the fundamental assumption that hijackers issue negotiable demands (most often
                for asylum or the release of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoners</ENAMEX>) and that, as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> put
                it,"suicide wasn't in the game plan" of hijackers. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> training material provided no
                guidance for flight <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crews</ENAMEX> should violence occur.
            
            This prevailing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Common Strategy</ENAMEX> of cooperation and nonconfrontation meant that even a
                hardened cockpit door would have made little difference in a hijacking. As the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Security Committee of the Air Line Pilots Association</ENAMEX> observed when
                proposals were made in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 2001</TIMEX> to install reinforced cockpit doors in commercial
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aircraft</ENAMEX>, "Even if you make a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">vault</ENAMEX> out of the door, if they have a noose around my
                flight <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attendant</ENAMEX>'s neck, I'm going to open the door." Prior to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> regulations
                mandated that cockpit doors permit ready access into and out of the cockpit in the
                event of an emergency. Even so, rules implemented in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">1960s</NUMEX> required air <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crews</ENAMEX> to
                keep the cockpit door closed and locked in flight. This requirement was not always
                observed or vigorously enforced.
            
            As for law enforcement, there were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 33</NUMEX> armed and trained federal air marshals as
                of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX>. They were not deployed on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> domestic flights, except when in transit to
                provide security on international departures. This policy reflected the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>'s view
                that domestic hijacking was in check-a view held confidently as no <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorist</ENAMEX> had
                hijacked a U.S.commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> anywhere in the world since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX>.
            
            In the absence of any recent aviation security incident and without "specific and
                credible" evidence of a plot directed at civil aviation, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>'s leadership
                focused elsewhere, including on operational concerns and the ever-present issue of
                safety. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA Administrator</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Garvey</ENAMEX> recalled that "<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every day in 2001</TIMEX> was like the day
                before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thanksgiving</TIMEX>." <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heeding</ENAMEX> calls for improved air service, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> concentrated
                its efforts on a "passenger bill of rights," to improve capacity, efficiency, and
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer</ENAMEX> satisfaction in the aviation system. There was no focus on terrorism.
            
             . . . AND IN THE <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY</ENAMEX>
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">National Security Act of 1947</ENAMEX> created the position of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelligence</ENAMEX> (DCI). Independent from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">departments</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice</ENAMEX>, and
                other policy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">departments</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DCI</ENAMEX> heads the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>intelligence <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> and provides
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intelligence</ENAMEX> to federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX>.
            The sole element of the intelligence <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> independent from a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cabinet agency</ENAMEX> is
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>. As an independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>, it collects, analyzes, and disseminates
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intelligence</ENAMEX> from all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>'s number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> of the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX>, who also has the authority to direct it to conduct covert
                    operations.
            
            Although covert actions represent a very small fraction of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agency</ENAMEX>'s entire
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">budget</ENAMEX>, these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> have at times been controversial and over time have
                dominated the public's perception of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DCI</ENAMEX> is confirmed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> but
                is not technically a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cabinet</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX>'s power under
                federal law over the loose, confederated "intelligence <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX>" is limited.
            
            He or she states the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX>'s priorities and coordinates development of
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intelligence</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> budget requests for submission to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>.
            This responsibility gives many the false impression that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DCI</ENAMEX> has line authority
                over the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heads</ENAMEX> of these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> and has the power to shift resources within these
                budgets as the need arises. Neither is true. In fact, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DCI</ENAMEX>'s real authority has
                been directly proportional to his personal closeness to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>, which has
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">waxed</ENAMEX> and waned over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</TIMEX>, and to others in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>, especially the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX> of defense.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelligence</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Defense</ENAMEX> account for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">approximately 80</TIMEX>
                percent of all <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> spending for intelligence, including some that supports a
                national <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customer base</ENAMEX> and some that supports specific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense Department</ENAMEX> or
                military service needs.
            
            As they are housed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense Department</ENAMEX>, these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> are keenly attentive to
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">military</ENAMEX>'s strategic and tactical requirements.
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the intelligence <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense</ENAMEX> with a national customer base is the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Security Agency</ENAMEX>, which intercepts and analyzes foreign communications and
                breaks codes. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSA</ENAMEX> also creates codes and ciphers to protect government
                information. Another is the recently renamed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency</ENAMEX>
                (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NGA</ENAMEX>), which provides and analyzes imagery and produces a wide array of products,
                including maps, navigation tools, and surveillance intelligence. A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> such agency
                in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Reconnaissance Office</ENAMEX>. It develops, procures, launches,
                and maintains in orbit information-gathering satellites that serve other government
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense Intelligence Agency</ENAMEX> supports the secretary of defense, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joint</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chiefs of Staff</ENAMEX>, and military field <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commanders</ENAMEX>. It does some collection through
                human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> as well as some technical intelligence collection. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Army</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Force</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marine Corps</ENAMEX> have their own intelligence <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">components</ENAMEX> that collect
                information, help them decide what <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX> to acquire, and serve the tactical
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intelligence</ENAMEX> needs of their respective services.
            In addition to those from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Defense</ENAMEX>, other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> in the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intelligence</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> include the national security parts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bureau of</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelligence and Research</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX>; the intelligence component of the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury Department</ENAMEX>; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Energy Department</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office of Intelligence</ENAMEX> and
                Counterintelligence, the former of which, through leveraging the expertise of the
                national <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory system</ENAMEX>, has special competence in nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX>; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office of</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelligence of the Coast Guard</ENAMEX>; and, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Directorate</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelligence</ENAMEX>
                Analysis and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Infrastructure Protection</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Homeland Security</ENAMEX>.
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Security Agency The National Security Agency</ENAMEX>'s intercepts of terrorist
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">communications</ENAMEX> often set off alarms elsewhere in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>. Often, too, its
                intercepts are conclusive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX>'s jigsaw puzzle. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineers</ENAMEX>
                build technical systems to break ciphers and to make sense of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s complex
                signals environment. Its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> listen to conversations between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreigners</ENAMEX> not
                meant for them. They also perform "traffic analysis"-studying technical
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">communications</ENAMEX> systems and codes as well as foreign organizational structures,
                including those of terrorist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Cold War</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adversaries</ENAMEX> used very hierarchical, familiar, and predictable military
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">command</ENAMEX> and control methods. With globalization and the telecommunications
                revolution, and with loosely affiliated but networked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">adversaries</ENAMEX> using commercial
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">devices</ENAMEX> and encryption, the technical impediments to signals collection grew at a
                geometric rate. At the same time, the end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Cold War</ENAMEX> and the resultant cuts in
                national security funding forced intelligence <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> to cut systems and seek
                economies of scale. Modern <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adversaries</ENAMEX> are skilled <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> of communications
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">technologies</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSA</ENAMEX>'s challenges, and its opportunities, increased exponentially
                in "volume, variety, and velocity."
            
            The law requires the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSA</ENAMEX> to not deliberately collect data on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> or on
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> without a warrant based on foreign intelligence
                requirements. Also, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSA</ENAMEX> was supposed to let the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> know of any indication of
                crime, espionage, or "terrorist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enterprise</ENAMEX>" so that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> could obtain the
                appropriate warrant. Later in this story, we will learn that while the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSA</ENAMEX> had the
                technical capability to report on communications with suspected terrorist facilities
                in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Middle East</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSA</ENAMEX> did not seek <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FISA Court</ENAMEX> warrants to collect
                communications between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> and foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>,
                because it believed that this was an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> role. It also did not want to be viewed as
                targeting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> and possibly violating laws that governed
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSA</ENAMEX>'s collection of foreign intelligence.
            
            An almost obsessive protection of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> and methods by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSA</ENAMEX>, and its focus on
                foreign intelligence, and its avoidance of anything domestic would, as will be seen,
                be important elements in the story of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX>.
            Technology as an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelligence Asset</ENAMEX> and Liability The application of newly developed
                scientific technology to the mission of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> war <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fighters</ENAMEX> and national security
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">decisionmakers</ENAMEX> is one of the great success stories of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">twentieth century</TIMEX>. It did
                not happen by accident. Recent wars have been waged and won decisively by brave men
                and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> using advanced technology that was developed, authorized, and paid for by
                conscientious and diligent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> and legislative branch <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many years</TIMEX>
                earlier.
            The challenge of technology, however, is a daunting <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>. It is expensive, sometimes
                fails, and often can create problems as well as solve them. Some of the advanced
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">technologies</ENAMEX> that gave us insight into the closed-off territories of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Soviet</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Union</ENAMEX> during the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Cold War</ENAMEX> are of limited use in identifying and tracking individual
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX>.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Terrorists</ENAMEX>, in turn, have benefited from this same rapid development of communication
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">technologies</ENAMEX>. They simply could buy off the shelf and harvest the products of a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$3</NUMEX>
                <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">trillion</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> telecommunications industry. They could acquire without great
                expense communication devices that were varied, global, instantaneous, complex, and
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">encrypted</ENAMEX>.
            The emergence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Wide Web</ENAMEX> has given <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX> a much easier means of
                acquiring information and exercising command and control over their operations. The
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">operational</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX> conspiracy, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mohamed Atta</ENAMEX>, went online from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hamburg</ENAMEX>,
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>, to research <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> flight <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>. Targets of intelligence collection have
                become more sophisticated. These changes have made surveillance and threat warning
                more difficult.
            Despite the problems that technology creates, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>' love affair with it leads
                them to also regard it as the solution. But technology produces its best results
                when an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> has the doctrine, structure, and incentives to exploit it. For
                example, even the best information technology will not improve information sharing
                so long as the intelligence <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>' personnel and security systems reward
                protecting information rather than disseminating it. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> is a descendant
                of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office of Strategic</ENAMEX> Services (OSS), which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roosevelt</ENAMEX> created early
                in <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX> after having first thought the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> might take that role. The father
                of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OSS</ENAMEX> was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William J." Wild Bill" Donovan</ENAMEX>, a Wall Street <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX>. He recruited
                into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OSS</ENAMEX> others like himself-well traveled, well connected, well-to-do
                professional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>.
            
            An innovation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donovan</ENAMEX>'s, whose legacy remains part of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> intelligence <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, was
                the establishment of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Research and Analysis Branch</ENAMEX>. There large numbers of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scholars</ENAMEX>
                from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">universities</ENAMEX> pored over accounts from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spies</ENAMEX>, communications intercepted by
                the armed forces, transcripts of radio broadcasts, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publications</ENAMEX> of all types,
                and prepared reports on economic, political, and social conditions in foreign
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">theaters</ENAMEX> of operation.
            At the end of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX>, to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donovan</ENAMEX>'s disappointment, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harry Truman</ENAMEX>
                dissolved the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office of Strategic Services</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Four months later</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">President</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">directed</ENAMEX> that "all Federal foreign intelligence activities be planned, developed and
                coordinated so as to assure the most effective accomplishment of the intelligence
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mission</ENAMEX> related to the national security," under a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Intelligence Authority</ENAMEX>
                consisting of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretaries</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">War</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX>, and a personal
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>. This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> was to be assisted by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelligence Group</ENAMEX>, made up of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> detailed from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">departments</ENAMEX> of each of the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> and headed by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central Intelligence</ENAMEX>.
            
            Subsequently, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Truman</ENAMEX> agreed to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">National Security Act of 1947</ENAMEX>, which,
                among other things, established the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central Intelligence Agency</ENAMEX>, under the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX>
                of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central Intelligence</ENAMEX>. Lobbying by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>, combined with fears of creating a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
                    Gestapo, led to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>'s being assigned
                responsibility for internal security functions and counterespionage. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> was
                specifically accorded "no <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX>, subpoena, or law enforcement powers or internal
                security functions." This <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> built in tensions
                between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense Department</ENAMEX>'s intelligence <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>, and between the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clandestine</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Covert Action</ENAMEX>.
             With this history, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> brought to the era of 9/11 many attributes of an elite
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX>, viewing itself as serving on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s front lines to engage
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enemies</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Officers</ENAMEX> in its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clandestine Service</ENAMEX>, under what became the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Directorate of Operations</ENAMEX>, fanned out into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stations</ENAMEX> abroad. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> of station
                was a very important <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>, given the additional title of the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DCI</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> in that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. He (occasionally she) was governed by an
                operating directive that listed operational priorities issued by the relevant
                regional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Directorate</ENAMEX>, constrained by centrally determined
                allocations of resources.
            Because the conduct of espionage was a high-risk activity, decisions on the
                clandestine targeting, recruitment, handling, and termination of secret <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> and
                the dissemination of collected information required <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>'s approval and
                action. But in this decentralized system, analogous in some ways to the culture of
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> field <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, everyone in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Directorate</ENAMEX> of
                Operations presumed that it was the job of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX> to support the field, rather
                than manage field activities.
            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> suffered exposure of its botched effort to land <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Cuban</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">exiles</ENAMEX> at
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bay</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Pigs</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Vietnam War</ENAMEX> brought on more criticism. A prominent feature of
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Watergate</ENAMEX> era was investigations of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committees</ENAMEX> headed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Frank Church</ENAMEX>
                in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Otis Pike</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX>. They published evidence that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> had
                secretly planned to assassinate <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fidel Castro</ENAMEX> and other foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX>. The
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> had not taken plain responsibility for these judgments. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> had
                taken most of the blame, saying they had done so in order to preserve the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX>'s "plausible deniability."
            
            After the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Watergate</ENAMEX> era, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> established oversight <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committees</ENAMEX> to ensure that the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> did not undertake covert action contrary to basic <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> law. Case <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> in
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clandestine Service</ENAMEX> interpreted legislation, such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hughes-Ryan</ENAMEX>
                Amendment requiring that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> approve and report to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> any covert
                action, as sending a message to them that covert action often leads to trouble and
                can severely damage one's career. Controversies surrounding <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Central American</ENAMEX> covert
                action programs in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-1980s</TIMEX> led to the indictment of several senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> of
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clandestine Service</ENAMEX>. During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1990s</TIMEX>, tension sometimes arose, as it did in the
                effort against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>, between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">policymakers</ENAMEX> who wanted the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> to undertake more
                aggressive covert action and wary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> who counseled prudence and making sure
                that the legal basis and presidential authorization for their actions were
                undeniably clear.
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clandestine Service</ENAMEX> felt the impact of the post-<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Cold War</ENAMEX> peace dividend, with
                cuts beginning in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX>. As the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> declined and overseas facilities
                were closed, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DCI</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> responded to developing crises in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Balkans</ENAMEX>
                or in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX> by "surging," or taking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> from across the service to use on the
                immediate problem. In many cases the surge <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> had little familiarity with the
                new issues. Inevitably, some parts of the world and some collection <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> were not
                fully covered, or not covered at all. This strategy also placed great emphasis on
                close relations with foreign liaison services, whose help was needed to gain
                information that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> itself did not have the capacity to collect.
            The nadir for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clandestine Service</ENAMEX> was in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>, when <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 25</NUMEX> trainees became new
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX>.
            
            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DCI</ENAMEX> was able to persuade the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> to endorse
                a long-range rebuilding program. It takes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five to seven years</TIMEX> of training, language
                study, and experience to bring a recruit up to full performance.
            
            Analysis.
             The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Directorate</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelligence</ENAMEX> retained some of its original <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> of a
                university gone to war. Its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> tended to judge one another by the
                quantity and quality of their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publications</ENAMEX> (in this case, classified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publications</ENAMEX>).
                Apart from their own <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peers</ENAMEX>, they looked for approval and guidance to policymakers.
                During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1990s</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, particular value is attached to having a contribution
                included in one of the classified <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">newspapers</ENAMEX>"- the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senior Executive</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelligence Brief-or</ENAMEX>, better still, selected for inclusion in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">President's Daily</ENAMEX>
                    Brief.
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> had been created to wage the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Cold War</ENAMEX>. Its steady focus on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one or two</TIMEX> primary
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">adversaries</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decade</TIMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decade</TIMEX>, had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> positive effect: it created an
                environment in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> could safely invest time and resources in
                basic research, detailed and reflective. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Payoffs</ENAMEX> might not be immediate. But when
                they wrote their estimates, even in brief papers, they could draw on a deep base of
                knowledge.
            When the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Cold War</ENAMEX> ended, those investments could not easily be reallocated to new
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enemies</ENAMEX>. The cultural effects ran even deeper. In a more fluid international
                environment with uncertain, changing goals and interests, intelligence <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> no
                longer felt they could afford such a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>, strategic approach to long-term
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accumulation</ENAMEX> of intellectual capital. A university culture with its versions of
                books and articles was giving way to the culture of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">newsroom</ENAMEX>.
            During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1990s</TIMEX>, the rise of round-the-clock news shows and the Internet reinforced
                pressure on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> to pass along fresh reports to policymakers at an ever-faster
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pace</ENAMEX>, trying to add context or supplement what their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">customers</ENAMEX> were receiving from
                the media. Weaknesses in all-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> and strategic analysis were highlighted by a
                panel, chaired by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Admiral David Jeremiah</ENAMEX>, that critiqued the intelligence
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">community</ENAMEX>'s failure to foresee the nuclear weapons tests by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> in
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>, as well as by a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1999</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>, chaired by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Rumsfeld</ENAMEX>, that discussed the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">community</ENAMEX>'s limited ability to assess the ballistic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missile</ENAMEX> threat to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX>. Both reports called attention to the dispersal of effort on too many
                priorities, the declining attention to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">craft</ENAMEX> of strategic analysis, and security
                rules that prevented adequate sharing of information. Another <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Cold War</ENAMEX> craft had
                been an elaborate set of methods for warning against surprise attack, but that too
                had faded in analyzing new dangers like terrorism.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Security</ENAMEX>. Another set of experiences that would affect the capacity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> to
                cope with the new terrorism traced back to the early <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Cold War</ENAMEX>, when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agency</ENAMEX>
                developed a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX>, bordering on <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">paranoia</ENAMEX>, about penetration by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KGB</ENAMEX>.
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Jesus Angleton</ENAMEX>, who headed counterintelligence in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> until the early
                1970s, became obsessed with the belief that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agency</ENAMEX> harbored one or more <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX>
                "moles." Although the pendulum swung back after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Angleton's</ENAMEX> forced retirement, it did
                not go very far. Instances of actual <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> penetration kept apprehensions
                    high.
            
            Then, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1990s</TIMEX>, came the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aldrich Ames</ENAMEX> espionage case, which intensely
                embarrassed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>. Though obviously unreliable, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ames</ENAMEX> had been protected and
                promoted by fellow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> while he paid his bills by selling to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Soviet Union</ENAMEX>
                the names of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>, a number of whom died as a result.
            The concern about security vastly complicated information sharing. Information was
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">compartmented</ENAMEX> in order to protect it against exposure to skilled and technologically
                sophisticated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adversaries</ENAMEX>. There were therefore numerous restrictions on handling
                information and a deep suspicion about sending information over newfangled
                electronic systems, like email, to other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>.
            
            Security <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concerns</ENAMEX> also increased the difficulty of recruiting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> qualified for
                counterterrorism. Very few <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">colleges</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">universities</ENAMEX> offered programs in
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Middle Eastern</ENAMEX> languages or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Islamic</ENAMEX> studies. The total number of undergraduate
                degrees granted in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Arabic</ENAMEX> in all <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">colleges</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">universities</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX> was
                    <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six</TIMEX>.
            
            Many who had traveled much outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> could expect a very long wait
                for initial clearance. Anyone who was foreign-born or had numerous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> abroad
                was well-advised not even to apply. With budgets for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> shrinking after the end
                of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Cold War</ENAMEX>, it was not surprising that, with some notable exceptions, new hires
                in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clandestine Service</ENAMEX> tended to have qualifications similar to those of serving
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX>: that is, they were suited for traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> recruitment or for
                exploiting liaison relationships with foreign services but were not equipped to seek
                or use assets inside the terrorist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX>.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Early Counterterrorism</ENAMEX> Efforts In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1970s and 1980s</TIMEX>, terrorism had been tied to
                regional conflicts, mainly in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Middle East</ENAMEX>. The majority of terrorist groups
                either were sponsored by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> or, like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Palestine Liberation Organization</ENAMEX>,
                were militants trying to create <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX>.
            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-1980s</TIMEX>, on the basis of a report from a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">task force</ENAMEX> headed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Bush</ENAMEX> and after terrorist attacks at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airports</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Athens</ENAMEX>, the DCI
                created a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Counterterrorist Center</ENAMEX> to unify activities across the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Directorate</ENAMEX> of
                Operations and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Directorate</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelligence</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Counterterrorist Center</ENAMEX> had
                representation from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>. In the formal table of organization
                it reported to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DCI</ENAMEX>, but in fact most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chiefs</ENAMEX> belonged to the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clandestine Service</ENAMEX> and usually looked for guidance to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Directorate</ENAMEX>
                of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Operations</ENAMEX>.
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center</ENAMEX> stimulated and coordinated collection of information by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stations</ENAMEX>,
                compiled the results, and passed selected reports to appropriate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stations</ENAMEX>, the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Directorate of Intelligence</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX>, other parts of the intelligence <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX>, or
                to policymakers. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center</ENAMEX> protected its bureaucratic turf. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelligence</ENAMEX> had once had a national intelligence <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> for terrorism to
                coordinate analysis; that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> was abolished in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 1980s</TIMEX> and its duties
                absorbed in part by the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Counterterrorist Center</ENAMEX>. Though <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> assigned to the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center</ENAMEX> produced a large number of papers, the focus was support to operations. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inspector general</ENAMEX>'s report in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX> criticized the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center</ENAMEX>'s capacity to provide
                warning of terrorist attacks.
            
            Subsequent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapters</ENAMEX> will raise the issue of whether, despite tremendous talent,
                energy, and dedication, the intelligence <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> failed to do enough in coping
                with the challenge from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>. Confronted with such questions,
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> in the intelligence <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> often responded that they had meager
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX> with which to work.
            
            Cuts in national security expenditures at the end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Cold War</ENAMEX> led to budget cuts
                in the national foreign intelligence <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">program</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal years 1990 to 1996</TIMEX> and
                essentially flat budgets from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal years 1996 to 2000</TIMEX> (except for the so-called
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gingrich</ENAMEX> supplemental to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">FY1999</NUMEX> budget and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two later</TIMEX>, smaller supplementals).
                These cuts compounded the difficulties of the intelligence <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>. Policymakers
                were asking them to move into the digitized future to fight against
                computer-to-computer communications and modern communication systems, while
                maintaining capability against older systems, such as high-frequency radios and
                ultra-high- and very-high-frequency (line of sight) systems that work like old-style
                television antennas. Also, demand for imagery increased dramatically following the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">success</ENAMEX> of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Gulf War</ENAMEX>. Both these developments, in turn, placed a premium on
                planning the next generation of satellite systems, the cost of which put great
                pressure on the rest of the intelligence budget. As a result, intelligence <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>
                experienced staff reductions, affecting both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operators</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX>.
            
            Yet at least for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>, part of the burden in tackling terrorism arose from the
                background we have described: an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> capable of attracting extraordinarily
                motivated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> but institutionally averse to risk, with its capacity for covert
                action atrophied, predisposed to restrict the distribution of information, having
                difficulty assimilating new types of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX>, and accustomed to presenting
                descriptive reportage of the latest intelligence. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>, to put it another way,
                needed significant change in order to get maximum effect in counterterrorism.
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> appointed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Tenet</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DCI</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>, and by all accounts
                terrorism was a priority for him. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tenet</ENAMEX>'s own assessment, when questioned by the
                Commission, was that in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>'s clandestine service was still at least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> away from being fully ready to play its counterterrorism role.
            
            And while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tenet</ENAMEX> was clearly the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>, the intelligence <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX>'s
                confederated structure left open the question of who really was in charge of the
                entire <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> intelligence effort. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.5</NUMEX> . . . AND IN THE <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STATE DEPARTMENT AND</ENAMEX> THE
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DEFENSE DEPARTMENT The State Department</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Commission</ENAMEX> asked <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Deputy Secretary</ENAMEX> of
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Armitage</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX> why the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX> had so long pursued what
                seemed, and ultimately proved, to be a hopeless effort to persuade the Taliban
                regime in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> to deport <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Armitage</ENAMEX> replied: "We do what the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Department</ENAMEX> does, we don't go out and fly <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bombers</ENAMEX>, we don't do things like that[;] .
                . . we do our part in these things."
            
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Fifty years earlier</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Armitage</ENAMEX>'s position would not have spoken of the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Department</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State</ENAMEX> as having such a limited role. Until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 1950s</TIMEX>, the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> dominated the processes of advising the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
                relations with the rest of the world. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Security Council</ENAMEX> was created in
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1947</TIMEX> largely as a result of lobbying from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> for a forum where the
                military could object if they thought the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX> was setting national
                objectives that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> did not have the wherewithal to pursue.
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX> retained primacy until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s</TIMEX>, when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kennedy</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Johnson</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">administrations</ENAMEX> turned instead to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert McNamara</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense Department</ENAMEX>, where a
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mini</ENAMEX>-state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> was created to analyze foreign policy issues. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Nixon</ENAMEX> then concentrated policy planning and policy coordination in a
                powerful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Security Council</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>, overseen by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Kissinger</ENAMEX>.
            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later years</TIMEX>, individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretaries of state</ENAMEX> were important figures, but the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX>'s role continued to erode. State came into the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">1990s</NUMEX> overmatched by the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX> of other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">departments</ENAMEX> and with little support for its budget either in the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> or in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office of Management and Budget</ENAMEX>. Like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> and the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Directorate of Operations</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX> had a tradition of emphasizing
                service in the field over service in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>. Even <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ambassadors</ENAMEX>, however, often
                found host <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> not only making connections with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> through
                their own <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">missions</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>, but working through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">station</ENAMEX> or a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">attach�.</ENAMEX> Increasingly, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">embassies</ENAMEX> themselves were overshadowed by powerful
                regional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commanders</ENAMEX> in chief reporting to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX>.
            
            Counterterrorism In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s and 1970s</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX> managed
                counterterrorism policy. It was the official <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> for communication with the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> presumed to be behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX>. Moreover, since terrorist
                incidents of this period usually ended in negotiations, an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ambassador</ENAMEX> or other
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">embassy</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> was the logical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> to represent <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> interests.
            Keeping <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> diplomatic efforts against terrorism coherent was a recurring challenge.
                In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1976</TIMEX>, at the direction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> elevated its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coordinator</ENAMEX> for
                combating terrorism to the rank equivalent to an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assistant secretary of state</ENAMEX>. As an
                "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ambassador</ENAMEX> at large," this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> sought to increase the visibility of
                counterterrorism matters within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> and to help integrate <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> policy
                implementation among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government agencies</ENAMEX>. The prolonged crisis of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1979-1981</TIMEX>, when <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">53</NUMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> were held hostage at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">embassy</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tehran</ENAMEX>, ended the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State</ENAMEX>
                Department <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> in counterterrorism. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carter</ENAMEX>'s assertive national
                security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zbigniew Brzezinski</ENAMEX>, took charge, and the coordination function
                remained thereafter in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX> of
                state, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Shultz</ENAMEX>, advocated active <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> efforts to combat terrorism, often
                recommending the use of military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Caspar Weinberger</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">opposed Shultz</ENAMEX>, who made little headCOUNTERTERRORISM
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weinberger</ENAMEX>, or even within his own <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX>. Though <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shultz</ENAMEX> elevated the
                status and visibility of counterterrorism coordination by appointing as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coordinator</ENAMEX>
                first <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L. Paul Bremer and then Robert Oakley</ENAMEX>, both senior career <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ambassadors</ENAMEX> of high
                standing in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Foreign Service</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> continued to be dominated by
                regional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bureaus</ENAMEX> for which terrorism was not a first-order <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX>.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretaries</ENAMEX> of state after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shultz</ENAMEX> took less personal interest in the problem. Only
                congressional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opposition</ENAMEX> prevented <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary of state</ENAMEX>,
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Warren Christopher</ENAMEX>, from merging terrorism into a new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bureau</ENAMEX> that would have also
                dealt with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">narcotics</ENAMEX> and crime. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coordinator</ENAMEX> under <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madeleine Albright</ENAMEX>
                told the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> that his job was seen as a minor <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX>.
            
            Although the description of his status has been disputed, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albright</ENAMEX>
                strongly supported the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 1998</TIMEX> strikes against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>, the role played by the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Department</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State</ENAMEX> in counterterrorism was often cautionary before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9/11</TIMEX>. This was a
                reflection of the reality that counterterrorism priorities nested within broader
                foreign policy aims of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX> consular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> around the world, it should not be forgotten, were
                constantly challenged by the problem of terrorism, for they handled visas for travel
                to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. After it was discovered that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abdel Rahman</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Blind Sheikh</ENAMEX>,
                had come and gone almost at will, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State</ENAMEX> initiated significant reforms to its
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">watchlist</ENAMEX> and visa-processing policies. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> passed legislation
                allowing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State</ENAMEX> to retain visa-processing fees for border security; those fees were
                then used by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> to fully automate the terrorist watchlist. By the late
                1990s, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State</ENAMEX> had created a worldwide, real-time electronic database of visa, law
                enforcement, and watchlist information, the core of the post-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX> border screening
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX>. Still, as will be seen <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> had many holes.
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Defense The Department of Defense</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">behemoth</ENAMEX> among federal
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>. With an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> budget larger than the gross domestic product of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX>, it
                is an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">empire</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense Department</ENAMEX> is part civilian, part military. The civilian
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary of defense</ENAMEX> has ultimate control, under the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>. Among the uniformed
                military, the top <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joint Chiefs of Staff</ENAMEX>, who is
                supported by a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joint Staff</ENAMEX> divided into standard military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> compartments-J-2
                (intelligence), <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">J-3</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX>), and so on.
            Because of the necessary and demanding focus on the differing mission of each
                service, and their long and proud traditions, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Army</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marine</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corps</ENAMEX> have often fought ferociously over roles and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">missions</ENAMEX> in war fighting and over
                budgets and posts of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> developments diminished this competition.
            The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> was the passage by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Goldwater-Nichols Act</ENAMEX>, which,
                among other things, mandated that promotion to high rank required some period of
                duty with a different service or with a joint (i.e., multiservice) command. This had
                strong and immediate effects, loosening the loyalties of senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> to their
                separate services and causing them to think more broadly about the military
                establishment as a whole.
            
            However, it also may have lessened the diversity of military advice and options
                presented to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goldwater-Nichols</ENAMEX> example is seen by some as having
                lessons applicable to lessening competition and increasing cooperation in other
                parts of the federal bureaucracy, particularly the law enforcement and intelligence
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX>.
            The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>, related development was a significant transfer of planning and command
                responsibilities from the service <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chiefs</ENAMEX> and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staffs</ENAMEX> to the joint and unified
                commands outside of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>, especially those for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Strategic Forces</ENAMEX> and for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">four</TIMEX>
                regions: <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South</ENAMEX>. Posts in these commands
                became prized assignments for ambitious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX>, and the voices of their <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five</TIMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commanders in chief</ENAMEX> became as influential as those of the service <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chiefs</ENAMEX>.
            Counterterrorism The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> first became concerned about terrorism as a result of
                hostage taking in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1970s</TIMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 1976</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Palestinian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX> seized an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> plane and landed it at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Entebbe</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Uganda</ENAMEX>, holding <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">105</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israelis</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX>
                as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hostages</ENAMEX>. A special <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commando force</ENAMEX> stormed the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX>, killed all the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">terrorists</ENAMEX>, and rescued all but one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hostages</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 1977</TIMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">West German</ENAMEX>
                special <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> dealt similarly with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lufthansa</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> sitting on a tarmac in
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mogadishu</ENAMEX>: every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorist</ENAMEX> was killed, and every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hostage</ENAMEX> brought back safely. The
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>, and the news media asked the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> whether the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX> was prepared for similar action. The answer was no. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Army</ENAMEX>
                immediately set about creating the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta Force</ENAMEX>, one of whose <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">missions</ENAMEX> was hostage
                rescue.
            The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> test for the new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> did not go well. It came in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 1980</TIMEX> during the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Iranian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hostage</ENAMEX> crisis, when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">helicopters</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> flew to a site
                known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Desert One</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">some 200 miles</NUMEX> southeast of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tehran</ENAMEX>, to rendezvous with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Force</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX> carrying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta Force</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commandos</ENAMEX> and fresh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fuel</ENAMEX>. Mild sandstorms disabled
                <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">helicopters</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commander</ENAMEX> ordered the mission aborted. But
                foul-ups on the ground resulted in the loss of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">airmen</ENAMEX>, and
                <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three marines</TIMEX>. Remembered as "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Desert One</ENAMEX>,"this failure remained vivid for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of
                the armed forces. It also contributed to the later <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goldwater-Nichols</ENAMEX> reforms.
            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1983</TIMEX> came <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hezbollah</ENAMEX>'s massacre of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marines</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beirut</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> quickly
                withdrew <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lebanon</ENAMEX>-a reversal later routinely cited by jihadists as
                evidence of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> weakness. A detailed investigation produced a list of new
                procedures that would become customary for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> deployed abroad. They involved a
                number of defensive measures, including caution not only about strange <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> and
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trucks</ENAMEX> but also about unknown aircraft overhead. "Force protection" became a
                significant claim on the time and resources of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Defense</ENAMEX>.
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A decade later</TIMEX>, the military establishment had another experience that evoked both
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Desert One</ENAMEX> and the withdrawal from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beirut</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> had authorized
                the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> to ensure humanitarian relief in war-torn <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Somalia</ENAMEX>.
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Tribal factions</ENAMEX> interfered with the supply missions. By the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">autumn of 1993</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">commanders</ENAMEX> concluded that the main source of trouble was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">warlord</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mohammed Farrah</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aidid</ENAMEX>. An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Army</ENAMEX> special <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> launched a raid on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mogadishu</ENAMEX> to capture him. In the
                course of a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">long night</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Black Hawk</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">helicopters</ENAMEX> were shot down, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">73</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> were
                wounded, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> were killed, and the world's television screens showed images of an
                <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">corpse</ENAMEX> dragged through the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">streets</ENAMEX> by exultant <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Somalis</ENAMEX>. Under pressure from
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> soon ordered the withdrawal of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX>. "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Black Hawk</ENAMEX>
                down" joined "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Desert One</ENAMEX>" as a symbol among <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> in uniform, code phrases used
                to evoke the risks of daring exploits without maximum preparation, overwhelming
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">force</ENAMEX>, and a well-defined mission.
            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995-1996</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense Department</ENAMEX> began to invest effort in planning how to handle
                the possibility of a domestic terrorist incident involving <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX> of mass
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">destruction</ENAMEX> (WMD). The idea of a domestic command for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">homeland</ENAMEX> defense began to be
                discussed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>, and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joint Chiefs</ENAMEX> developed a concept for the
                establishment of a domestic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unified Command</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> killed the idea. Instead, the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Department</ENAMEX> established the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joint Forces Command</ENAMEX>, located at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Norfolk</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX>,
                making it responsible for military response to domestic emergencies, both natural
                and man-made.
            
            Pursuant to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nunn-Lugar-Domenici Domestic Preparedness Program</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Department</ENAMEX> began in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX> to train <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> responders in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">120</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s largest
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>. As a key part of its efforts, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense</ENAMEX> created <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Guard WMD Civil</ENAMEX>
                Support <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Teams</ENAMEX> to respond in the event of a WMD terrorist incident. A total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX>
                such <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Guard</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teams</ENAMEX> were authorized by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 2001</TIMEX>. Under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">command</ENAMEX> of
                state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governors</ENAMEX>, they provided support to civilian <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> to assess the nature of
                the attack, offer medical and technical advice, and coordinate state and local
                    responses.
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Defense</ENAMEX>, like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of State</ENAMEX>, had a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coordinator</ENAMEX> who
                represented the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> on the interagency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committee</ENAMEX> concerned with
                counterterrorism. By the end of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> term, this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> had
                become the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assistant secretary</ENAMEX> of defense for special <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> and low-intensity
                    conflict.
            
            The experience of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">1980s</NUMEX> had suggested to the military establishment that if it
                were to have a role in counterterrorism, it would be a traditional military role-to
                act against state <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sponsors</ENAMEX> of terrorism. And the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">military</ENAMEX> had what seemed an
                excellent example of how to do it. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bomb</ENAMEX> went off at a disco in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX>,
                killing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">soldiers</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelligence</ENAMEX> clearly linked the bombing to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Libya</ENAMEX>'s
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Colonel</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Muammar Qadhafi</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> ordered air strikes against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Libya</ENAMEX>. The
                operation was not cost free: the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX> lost <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX>. Evidence accumulated
                later, including the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX> bombing of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan Am</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">103</NUMEX>, clearly showed that the operation
                did not curb <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qadhafi</ENAMEX>'s interest in terrorism. However, it was seen at the time as a
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">success</ENAMEX>. The lesson then taken from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Libya</ENAMEX> was that terrorism could be stopped by the
                use of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> air power that inflicted pain on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sponsors</ENAMEX> of terrorist
                acts.
            This lesson was applied, using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tomahawk</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missiles</ENAMEX>, early in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinton</ENAMEX>
                administration. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George H.W. Bush</ENAMEX> was scheduled to visit <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuwait</ENAMEX> to be honored for his
                rescue of that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Gulf War of 1991</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Kuwaiti</ENAMEX> security services warned
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Iraqi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> were planning to assassinate the former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>.
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> not only ordered precautions to protect <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> but asked about
                options for a reprisal against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> proposed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> targets for Tomahawk
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missiles</ENAMEX>. Debate in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> and at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> about possible collateral damage
                pared the list down to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>, then to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>- <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Iraqi</ENAMEX> intelligence <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX> in
                central <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baghdad</ENAMEX>. The attack was made at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>, to minimize civilian <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">casualties</ENAMEX>.
                <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twenty-three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missiles</ENAMEX> were fired. Other than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> civilian <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">casualty</ENAMEX>, the operation
                seemed completely successful: the intelligence <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX> was demolished. No
                further intelligence came in about terrorist acts planned by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX>.
            
            The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX> attack in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Libya</ENAMEX> and the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX> attack on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> symbolized for the military
                establishment effective use of military power for counterterrorism- limited
                retaliation with air power, aimed at deterrence. What remained was the hard question
                of how deterrence could be effective when the adversary was a loose transnational
                network.
             . . . AND IN THE <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WHITE HOUSE</ENAMEX>
            Because coping with terrorism was not (and is not) the sole <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">province</ENAMEX> of any component
                of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>, some coordinating mechanism is necessary. When terrorism was
                not a prominent issue, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX> could perform this role. When the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Iranian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hostage</ENAMEX> crisis developed, this procedure went by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National</ENAMEX>
                Security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Advisor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zbigniew Brzezinski</ENAMEX> took charge of crisis management.
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> continued and formalized the practice of having
                presidential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> coordinate counterterrorism. After the killing of the marines in
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beirut</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> signed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Security Directive 138</ENAMEX>, calling for a
                "shift . . . from passive to active defense measures" and reprogramming or adding
                new resources to effect the shift. It directed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX> "to intensify
                efforts to achieve cooperation of other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX>" and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> to "intensify use
                of liaison and other intelligence capabilities and also to develop plans and
                capability to preempt <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> planning strikes against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
                    interests."
            
            Speaking to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Bar Association</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 1985</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> characterized
                terrorism as "an act of war" and declared:"There can be no place on earth left where
                it is safe for these monsters to rest, to train, or practice their cruel and deadly
                skills. We must act together, or unilaterally, if necessary to ensure that
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX> have no <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">sanctuary</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">anywhere</NUMEX>." The air strikes
                against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Libya</ENAMEX> were one manifestation of this strategy.
            Through most of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> term, the coordination of counterterrorism
                was overseen by a high-level interagency committee chaired by the deputy national
                security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adviser</ENAMEX>. But the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> closed with a major scandal that
                cast a cloud over the notion that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> should guide counterterrorism.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> was concerned because <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hezbollah</ENAMEX> was taking <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> hostage and
                periodically killing them. He was also constrained by a bill he signed into law that
                made it illegal to ship military aid to anticommunist <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Contra</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guerrillas</ENAMEX> in
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nicaragua</ENAMEX>, whom he strongly supported. His national security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adviser</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Robert</ENAMEX>
                McFarlane, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McFarlane</ENAMEX>'s deputy, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Admiral John Poindexter</ENAMEX>, thought the hostage
                problem might be solved and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> position in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Middle East</ENAMEX> improved if the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX> quietly negotiated with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> about exchanging <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hostages</ENAMEX> for modest
                quantities of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shultz</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weinberger</ENAMEX>, united for once, opposed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McFarlane</ENAMEX> and
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Poindexter</ENAMEX>.
            A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staffer</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McFarlane</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Poindexter</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lieutenant Colonel</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oliver North</ENAMEX>,
                developed a scheme to trade <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hostages</ENAMEX> and divert the proceeds to the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Contras</ENAMEX> to get around <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> law. He may have had encouragement from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX> of
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central Intelligence</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Casey</ENAMEX>.
            
            When the facts were revealed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986 and 1987</TIMEX>, it appeared to be the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">1970s</NUMEX> all over
                again: a massive abuse of covert action. Now, instead of stories about poisoned
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cigars</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mafia</ENAMEX> hit <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> heard testimony about a secret visit to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tehran</ENAMEX>
                by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McFarlane</ENAMEX>, using an assumed name and bearing a chocolate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cake</ENAMEX> decorated with
                icing depicting a key. An investigation by a special <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counsel</ENAMEX> resulted in the
                indictment of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McFarlane</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Poindexter</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">North</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> others, including several
                high-ranking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clandestine Service</ENAMEX>. The investigations
                spotlighted the importance of accountability and official responsibility for
                faithful execution of laws. For the story of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX>, the significance of the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Iran-Contra</ENAMEX> affair was that it made parts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bureaucracy</ENAMEX> reflexively skeptical
                about any operating directive from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>.
            
            As the national security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisor</ENAMEX>'s function expanded, the procedures and structure of
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisor</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>, conventionally called the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Security Council</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>,
                became more formal. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisor</ENAMEX> developed recommendations for presidential
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">directives</ENAMEX>, differently labeled by each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>. For <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>, they were
                to be <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Presidential Decision Directives</ENAMEX>; for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George W. Bush</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Security Policy Directives</ENAMEX>. These documents and many others requiring approval by
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> worked their way through interagency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committees</ENAMEX> usually composed of
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">departmental</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assistant secretary</ENAMEX> level or just below it. The
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> had senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX> who would sit on these interagency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committees</ENAMEX>, often
                as chair, to facilitate agreement and to represent the wider interests of the
                national security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisor</ENAMEX>. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> took office, he decided right away
                to coordinate counterterrorism from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 25, 1993</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mir Amal</ENAMEX>
                Kansi, an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Islamic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">extremist</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>, shot and killed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> at the
                main highway entrance to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX>. (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kansi</ENAMEX> drove away and was
                captured abroad much later.) <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Only a month</TIMEX> afterward came the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Trade Center</ENAMEX>
                bombing and, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few weeks</TIMEX> after that, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Iraqi</ENAMEX> plot against former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s first national security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anthony Lake</ENAMEX>, had retained from
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staffer</ENAMEX> who dealt with crime, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">narcotics</ENAMEX>, and terrorism
                (a portfolio often known as "<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">thugs</ENAMEX>"), the veteran civil <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">servant</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lake</ENAMEX> turned to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> to do the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> work for them in
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coordinating</ENAMEX> counterterrorism. Before long, he would chair a midlevel interagency
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">committee</ENAMEX> eventually titled the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Counterterrorism Security Group</ENAMEX> (CSG). We will later
                tell of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX>'s evolution as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adviser</ENAMEX> on and, in time, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">counterterrorist</ENAMEX> effort. When explaining the missile strike against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> provoked by
                the plot to kill <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> stated:"From <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first days</TIMEX> of
                our <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Revolution</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>'s security has depended on the clarity of the message: Don't
                tread on us. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX> and commensurate response was essential to protect our
                sovereignty, to send a message to those who engage in state-sponsored terrorism, to
                deter further violence against our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, and to affirm the expectation of
                civilized behavior among <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nations</ENAMEX>."
            
            In his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State of the Union</ENAMEX> message in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 1995</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> promised
                "comprehensive legislation to strengthen our hand in combating <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX>, whether
                they strike at home or abroad." In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February</TIMEX>, he sent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> proposals to extend
                federal criminal jurisdiction, to make it easier to deport <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX>, and to act
                against terrorist fund-raising. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early May</TIMEX>, he submitted a bundle of strong
                amendments. The interval had seen the news from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX> that a doomsday <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cult</ENAMEX>,
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aum Shinrikyo</ENAMEX>, had released sarin nerve <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> in a subway, killing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> and injuring
                <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX>. The sect had extensive properties and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratories</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">worldwide</ENAMEX>, including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>. Neither the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> nor the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> had ever heard of
                it. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX> had come the bombing of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Murrah</ENAMEX> federal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oklahoma City</ENAMEX>;
                immediate suspicions that it had been the work of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Islamists</ENAMEX> turned out to be wrong,
                and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bombers</ENAMEX> proved to be <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antigovernment extremists</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Timothy Mc</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Veigh</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Terry Nichols</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> proposed to amend his earlier proposals
                by increasing wiretap and electronic surveillance authority for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>, requiring
                that explosives carry traceable taggants, and providing substantial new money not
                only for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> but also for local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX>.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> issued a classified directive in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 1995</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Presidential Decision</ENAMEX>
                Directive <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX>, which said that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> should "deter, defeat and respond
                vigorously to all terrorist attacks on our <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">territory</ENAMEX> and against our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX>." The
                directive called terrorism both a matter of national security and a crime, and it
                assigned responsibilities to various <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>. Alarmed by the incident in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX>,
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> made it the very highest priority for his own <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> and for all
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> to prepare to detect and respond to terrorism that involved <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemical</ENAMEX>,
                biological, or nuclear weapons.
            
            During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995 and 1996</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> devoted considerable time to seeking
                cooperation from other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nations</ENAMEX> in denying <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">sanctuary</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX>. He proposed
                significantly larger budgets for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>, with much of the increase designated for
                counterterrorism. For the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>, he essentially stopped cutting allocations and
                supported requests for supplemental funds for counterterrorism.
            
            When announcing his new national security <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> after being reelected in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>,
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> mentioned terrorism <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> in a list of several challenges facing
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>.
            
            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>, after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>'s fatwa and other alarms, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> accepted a
                proposal from his national security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samuel "Sandy" Berger</ENAMEX>, and gave <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX>
                a new position as national <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coordinator</ENAMEX> for security, infrastructure protection, and
                counterterrorism. He issued <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Presidential Decision Directives</ENAMEX>, numbers <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">62 and 63</TIMEX>,
                that built on the assignments to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> that had been made in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Presidential</ENAMEX>
                Decision Directive <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39</NUMEX>; laid out <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> program areas for counterterrorism; and
                enhanced, at least on paper, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX>'s authority to police these assignments. Because
                of concerns especially on the part of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Attorney General</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reno</ENAMEX>, this new authority was
                defined in precise and limiting language. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> was only to "provide advice"
                regarding budgets and to "coordinate the development of interagency agreed
                guidelines" for action.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> also was awarded a seat on the cabinet-level <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Principals Committee</ENAMEX> when it met
                on his issues-a highly unusual step for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staffer</ENAMEX>. His interagency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>,
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSG</ENAMEX>, ordinarily reported to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deputies Committee</ENAMEX> of subcabinet <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>,
                unless <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX> asked them to report directly to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principals</ENAMEX>. The complementary
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">directive</ENAMEX>, number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">63</NUMEX>, defined the elements of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s critical infrastructure
                and considered ways to protect it. Taken together, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> directives basically left
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> in charge at home and left terrorism abroad to
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX>, and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>, under <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX>'s and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX>'s
                coordinating hands. Explaining the new arrangement and his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concerns</ENAMEX> in another
                commencement speech, this time at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Naval Academy</ENAMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 1998</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">President</ENAMEX>
                said: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First</ENAMEX>, we will use our new integrated approach to intensify the fight against
                all forms of terrorism: to capture <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX>, no matter where they hide; to work
                with other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nations</ENAMEX> to eliminate terrorist sanctuaries overseas; to respond rapidly
                and effectively to protect <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> from terrorism at home and abroad. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, we
                will launch a comprehensive plan to detect, deter, and defend against attacks on our
                critical infrastructures, our power systems, water supplies, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX>, fire, and
                medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">services</ENAMEX>, air traffic control, financial services, telephone systems, and
                computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX>. . . . <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, we will undertake a concerted effort to prevent the
                spread and use of biological weapons and to protect our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in the event these
                terrible <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX> are ever unleashed by a rogue <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, a terrorist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, or an
                international criminal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>. . . . Finally, we must do more to protect our
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilian population</ENAMEX> from biological weapons.
            
            Clearly, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX>'s concern about terrorism had steadily risen. That heightened
                worry would become even more obvious <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early in 1999</TIMEX>, when he addressed the National
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Academy of Sciences</ENAMEX> and presented his most somber account yet of what could happen
                if the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> were hit, unprepared, by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX> wielding either <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX> of
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">mass</ENAMEX> destruction or potent <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cyberweapons</ENAMEX>.
             . . . AND IN THE <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CONGRESS</ENAMEX>
            Since the beginning of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Republic</ENAMEX>, few debates have been as hotly contested as the
                <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> over <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> versus legislative powers. At the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Constitutional Convention</ENAMEX>, the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">founders</ENAMEX> sought to create a strong <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> but check its powers. They left those
                powers sufficiently ambiguous so that <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> was left for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> and the president
                to struggle over the direction of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX>'s security and foreign policies.
            The most serious question has centered on whether or not the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> needs
                congressional authorization to wage war. The current status of that debate seems to
                have settled into a recognition that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> can deploy military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> for
                small and limited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX>, but needs at least congressional support if not
                explicit authorization for large and more open-ended military operations.
            This calculus becomes important in this story as both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">President</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> chose not to seek a declaration of war on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> after he had declared and
                begun to wage war on us, a declaration that they did not acknowledge publicly. Not
                until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">after 9/11</TIMEX> was a congressional authorization sought.
            The most substantial change in national security oversight in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> took place
                following <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War</ENAMEX> II. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Congressional Reorganization Act of 1946</ENAMEX> created the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">modern Armed Services</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committees</ENAMEX> that have become so powerful <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> especially
                noteworthy innovation was the creation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joint House-Senate Atomic Energy</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Committee</ENAMEX>, which is credited by many with the development of our nuclear deterrent
                capability and was also criticized for wielding too much power relative to the
                executive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX>.
            Ironically, this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committee</ENAMEX> was eliminated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1970s</TIMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> was undertaking
                the next most important reform of oversight in response to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Church</ENAMEX> and Pike
                investigations into abuses of power. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1977</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> created select
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">committees</ENAMEX> to exercise oversight of the executive branch's conduct of intelligence
                operations.
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelligence Committees The House</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> select <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committees</ENAMEX> on intelligence
                share some important characteristics. They have limited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX>. They do not
                have exclusive authority over intelligence <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>. Appropriations are ultimately
                determined by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appropriations</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committees</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Armed Services</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committees</ENAMEX> exercise
                jurisdiction over the intelligence <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Defense</ENAMEX> (and,
                in the case of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX>, over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central Intelligence Agency</ENAMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> consequence is
                that the rise and fall of intelligence budgets are tied directly to trends in
                defense spending.
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> is required by law to ensure the congressional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelligence</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committees</ENAMEX>
                are kept fully and currently informed of the intelligence activities of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committees</ENAMEX> allow the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> to some extent to withhold information in order
                to protect <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>, methods, and operations. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> must bring presidentially
                authorized covert action <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Findings and Memoranda of Notification</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelligence</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">committees</ENAMEX>, and it must detail its failures. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committees</ENAMEX> conduct their most
                important work in closed hearings or briefings in which security over classified
                material can be maintained. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelligence</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committees</ENAMEX> serve for a
                limited time, a restriction imposed by each <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX>. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> believe these
                limits prevent committee <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> from developing the necessary expertise to conduct
                effective oversight.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Secrecy</ENAMEX>, while necessary, can also harm oversight. The overall budget of the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intelligence</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> is classified, as are most of its activities. Thus, the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelligence</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committees</ENAMEX> cannot take advantage of democracy's best oversight
                mechanism: public disclosure. This makes them significantly different from other
                congressional oversight <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committees</ENAMEX>, which are often spurred into action by the work
                of investigative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalists</ENAMEX> and watchdog <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>. Adjusting to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post-Cold</ENAMEX>
                War Era The unexpected and rapid end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Cold War</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX> created trauma in the
                foreign policy and national security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> both in and out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>. While
                some criticized the intelligence <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> for failing to forecast the collapse of
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> (and used this argument to propose drastic cuts in intelligence
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agencies</ENAMEX>), most recognized that the good news of being relieved of the substantial
                burden of maintaining a security structure to meet the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> challenge was
                accompanied by the bad news of increased insecurity. In many directions, the
                community faced threats and intelligence challenges that it was largely unprepared
                to meet.
            So did the intelligence oversight <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committees</ENAMEX>. New digitized technologies, and the
                demand for imagery and continued capability against older systems, meant the need to
                spend more on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">satellite systems</ENAMEX> at the expense of human efforts. In addition, denial
                and deception became more effective as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> learned from public <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> what our
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intelligence</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> were doing. There were comprehensive reform proposals of the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intelligence</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX>, such as those offered by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Senators</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boren</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCurdy</ENAMEX>. That
                said, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> still took too little action to address institutional
                    weaknesses.
            
            With the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Cold War</ENAMEX> over, and the intelligence <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> roiled by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ames</ENAMEX> spy
                scandal, a presidential commission chaired first by former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary of defense</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Les</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aspin</ENAMEX> and later by former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary of defense</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harold Brown</ENAMEX> examined the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intelligence</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX>'s future. After it issued recommendations addressing the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DCI</ENAMEX>'s lack of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> and budget authority over the intelligence <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX>, the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelligence</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committees</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> introduced implementing legislation to remedy these
                problems.
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Defense</ENAMEX> and its congressional authorizing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committees</ENAMEX> rose in
                opposition to the proposed changes. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DCI</ENAMEX> did not actively support
                these changes. Relatively small changes made in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> gave the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DCI consultative</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">authority</ENAMEX> and created a new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">deputy</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> and assistant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DCIs</ENAMEX> for collection
                and analysis. These reforms occurred only after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate Select Committee on</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelligence</ENAMEX> took the unprecedented step of threatening to bring down the defense
                <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">authorization bill.</ENAMEX> Indeed, rather than increasing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DCI</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> over
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">national</ENAMEX> intelligence, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1990s</TIMEX> witnessed movement in the opposite direction
                through, for example, the transfer of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>'s imaging analysis capability to the
                new imagery and mapping <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> created within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Defense</ENAMEX>.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress Adjusts Congress</ENAMEX> as a whole, like the executive branch, adjusted slowly to
                the rise of transnational terrorism as a threat to national security. In particular,
                the growing threat and capabilities of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> were not understood in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>. As
                the most representative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> of the federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> closely tracks
                trends in what public opinion and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">electorate</ENAMEX> identify as key issues. In the
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 11</TIMEX>, terrorism seldom registered as important. To the extent
                that terrorism did break through and engage the attention of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> as a
                whole, it would briefly command attention after a specific incident, and then return
                to a lower rung on the public policy agenda.
            Several points about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> are worth noting. First, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> always has a strong
                orientation toward domestic affairs. It usually takes on foreign policy and national
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">security</ENAMEX> issues after threats are identified and articulated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>.
                In the absence of such a detailed-and repeated-articulation, national security tends
                not to rise very high on the list of congressional priorities. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Presidents</ENAMEX> are
                selective in their use of political capital for international issues.
            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the decade</TIMEX> before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9/11</TIMEX>, presidential discussion of and congressional and public
                attention to foreign affairs and national security were dominated by other
                issues-among them, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Haiti</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bosnia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Somalia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kosovo</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">enlargement</ENAMEX>,
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Middle East</ENAMEX> peace process, missile defense, and globalization. Terrorism
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">infrequently</ENAMEX> took center stage; and when it did, the context was often <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX>'
                tactics-a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemical</ENAMEX>, biological, nuclear, or computer threat-not terrorist
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX>.
            
            <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> tends to follow the overall lead of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> on budget issues
                with respect to national security matters. There are often sharp arguments about
                individual programs and internal priorities, but by and large the overall funding
                authorized and appropriated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> comes out close to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>'s
                request. This tendency was certainly illustrated by the downward trends in spending
                on defense, intelligence, and foreign affairs in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> part of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1990s</TIMEX>. The
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>, to be sure, read the political signals coming from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Capitol Hill</ENAMEX>, but
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> largely acceded to the executive branch's funding requests. In the
                <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the decade</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> appropriated some <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">98 percent</NUMEX> of what the
                administration requested for intelligence programs. Apart from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gingrich</ENAMEX>
                supplemental of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1.5 billion</NUMEX> for overall intelligence programs in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fiscal year 1999</TIMEX>,
                the key decisions on overall allocation of resources for national security issues in
                the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decade</TIMEX> before <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX>-including counterterrorism funding-were made in the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office of Management and Budget</ENAMEX>.
            
            <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> did not reorganize itself after the end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Cold War</ENAMEX> to address
                new threats. Recommendations by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joint Committee on the Organization of Congress</ENAMEX>
                were implemented, in part, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House of Representatives</ENAMEX> after the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX> elections,
                but there was no reorganization of national security functions. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> undertook
                no appreciable changes. Traditional issues-foreign policy, defense,
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intelligence</ENAMEX>-continued to be handled by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committees</ENAMEX> whose <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> remained largely
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">unaltered</ENAMEX>, while issues such as transnational terrorism fell between the cracks.
                Terrorism came under the jurisdiction of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 14</NUMEX> different <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committees</ENAMEX> in the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> alone, and budget and oversight functions in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> concerning
                terrorism were also splintered badly among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committees</ENAMEX>. Little effort was made to
                consider an integrated policy toward terrorism, which might range from identifying
                the threat to addressing vulnerabilities in critical infrastructure; and the
                piecemeal approach in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> contributed to the problems of the executive
                branch in formulating such a policy.
            
            <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Fourth</NUMEX>, the oversight function of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> has diminished over time. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX>,
                traditional review of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> of programs and the implementation of laws
                has been replaced by "a focus on personal investigations, possible scandals, and
                issues designed to generate media attention." The unglamorous but essential work of
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oversight</ENAMEX> has been neglected, and few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> past or present believe it is
                performed well. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DCI Tenet</ENAMEX> told us: "We ran from threat to threat to threat. . . .
                [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>]here was not a system in place to say,<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">'You</ENAMEX> got to go back and do this and this
                and this.'" Not just the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DCI</ENAMEX> but the entire executive branch needed help from
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> in addressing the questions of counterterrorism strategy and policy,
                looking past <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day-to-day</TIMEX> concerns. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Members</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>, however, also found their
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> spent on such everyday matters, or in looking back to investigate mistakes, and
                often missed the big questions-as did the executive branch. Staff tended as well to
                focus on parochial considerations, seeking to add or cut funding for individual
                (often small) programs, instead of emphasizing comprehensive oversight
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">projects</ENAMEX>.
            
            <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Fifth</NUMEX>, on certain issues, other priorities pointed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> in a direction that was
                unhelpful in meeting the threats that were emerging in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the months</TIMEX> leading up to
                <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Committees</ENAMEX> with oversight responsibility for aviation focused overwhelmingly
                on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX> congestion and the economic health of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">airlines</ENAMEX>, not aviation
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">security</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Committees</ENAMEX> with responsibility for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INS</ENAMEX> focused on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southwest</ENAMEX>
                border, not on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> told us that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committees</ENAMEX> with
                responsibility for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> tightly restricted appropriations for improvements in
                information technology, in part because of concerns about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>'s ability to
                manage such projects. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Committees</ENAMEX> responsible for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Asia</ENAMEX> spent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the decade</TIMEX> of the
                1990s imposing sanctions on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>, leaving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">presidents</ENAMEX> with little leverage to
                alter <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>'s policies before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9/11</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Committees</ENAMEX> with responsibility for the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense Department</ENAMEX> paid little heed to developing military responses to terrorism
                and stymied intelligence reform. All <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committees</ENAMEX> found themselves swamped in the
                minutiae of the budget process, with little time for consideration of longer-term
                questions, or what many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> past and present told us was the proper conduct of
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oversight</ENAMEX>.
            
            Each of these trends contributed to what can only be described as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>'s slowness
                and inadequacy in treating the issue of terrorism in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years before 9/11</TIMEX>. The
                legislative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> adjusted little and did not restructure itself to address
                changing threats.
            
            Its attention to terrorism was episodic and splintered across several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committees</ENAMEX>.
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> gave little guidance to executive branch <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>, did not reform them in
                any significant way, and did not systematically perform oversight to identify,
                address, and attempt to resolve the many problems in national security and domestic
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> that became apparent in the aftermath of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX>.
            Although individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">senators</ENAMEX> took significant steps, the overall
                level of attention in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> to the terrorist threat was low. We examined the
                number of hearings on terrorism from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 1998 to September 2001</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Armed Services Committee</ENAMEX> held <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> related to the attack on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">USS Cole</ENAMEX>. The
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Armed Services Committee</ENAMEX> also held <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> of them by a special oversight
                panel on terrorism. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate Foreign Relations Committee</ENAMEX> and its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> counterpart
                both held <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate Select Committee on Intelligence</ENAMEX>, in addition to its
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> worldwide threat hearing, held <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX>; its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterpart</ENAMEX> held perhaps <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
                exclusively devoted to counterterrorism, plus the briefings by its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorist</ENAMEX> working
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> intelligence <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panels</ENAMEX> did not raise public and
                congressional attention on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> prior to the joint inquiry into
                the attacks of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 11</TIMEX>, perhaps in part because of the classified nature of
                their work. Yet in the context of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committees</ENAMEX> that each hold scores of hearings every
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX> on issues in their jurisdiction, this list is not impressive. Terrorism was a
                <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>- or <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX>-order priority within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committees</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> responsible for
                national security.
            
            In fact, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> had a distinct tendency to push questions of emerging national
                security threats off its own plate, leaving them for others to consider. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>
                asked outside commissions to do the work that arguably was at the heart of its own
                oversight responsibilities.
            
            Beginning in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>, the reports of these commissions made scores of recommendations to
                address terrorism and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">homeland</ENAMEX> security but drew little attention from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>.
                Most of their impact came after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX>.

            <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">BEFORE THE BOMBINGS IN KENYA AND TANZANIA</ENAMEX>
            Although the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Intelligence Estimate</ENAMEX> had warned of a new type of
                terrorism, many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> continued to think of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> of states
                (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Saudi Hezbollah</ENAMEX> acting for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Khobar Towers</ENAMEX>) or as domestic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">criminals</ENAMEX>
                (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Timothy Mc Veigh</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oklahoma City</ENAMEX>). As we pointed out in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">chapter 3</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>
                is not a natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">locus</ENAMEX> for program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>. Hence, government efforts to cope
                with terrorism were essentially the work of individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Clinton</ENAMEX>'s counterterrorism <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Presidential Decision Directives</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>
                (no. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39</NUMEX>) and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 1998</TIMEX> (no. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">62</NUMEX>) reiterated that terrorism was a national security
                problem, not just a law enforcement issue. They reinforced the authority of the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Security Council</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSC</ENAMEX>) to coordinate domestic as well as foreign
                counterterrorism efforts, through <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Clarke</ENAMEX> and his interagency
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Counterterrorism Security Group</ENAMEX> (CSG). Spotlighting new concerns about
                <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">unconventional attacks</ENAMEX>, these directives assigned tasks to lead <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> but did not
                differentiate types of terrorist threats. Thus, while <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> might prod or push
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> to act, what actually happened was usually decided at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX>,
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>, or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX>. The efforts of these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> were
                sometimes energetic and sometimes effective. Terrorist plots were disrupted and
                individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX> were captured. But the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> did not, before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9/11</TIMEX>,
                adopt as a clear strategic objective the elimination of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>. Early Efforts
                against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> Until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>, hardly anyone in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> government understood that
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Usama Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> was an inspirer and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">organizer</ENAMEX> of the new terrorism. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>
                noted that he had paid for the training of some <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Egyptian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sudan</ENAMEX>. The
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX> detected his money in aid to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Yemeni</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX> who set a bomb
                in an attempt to kill <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Aden</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> even saw
                suspicious links with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Omar Abdel Rahman</ENAMEX>, the "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Blind Sheikh</ENAMEX>" in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> area,
                commenting that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> seemed "committed to financing 'Jihads' against 'anti
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Islamic</ENAMEX>' regimes worldwide." After the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> designated <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sudan</ENAMEX> a state sponsor
                of terrorism in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>, it put <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> on its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TIPOFF</ENAMEX> watchlist, a move that might
                have prevented his getting a visa had he tried to enter the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. As late
                as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>, however, even the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Counterterrorist Center</ENAMEX> continued to describe him
                as an "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">extremist financier</ENAMEX>."
            
            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> set up a special <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a dozen</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> to analyze intelligence on
                and plan <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Cohen</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>'s
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Directorate of Operations</ENAMEX>, wanted to test the idea of having a "virtual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">station</ENAMEX>"-a
                station based at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX> but collecting and operating against a subject much as
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stations</ENAMEX> in the field focus on a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. Taking his cue from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Security</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Advisor Anthony Lake</ENAMEX>, who expressed special interest in terrorist finance, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cohen</ENAMEX>
                formed his virtual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">station</ENAMEX> as a terrorist financial links <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX>. He had trouble
                getting any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Directorate of Operations</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> to run it; he finally recruited a
                former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> who was then running the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Islamic Extremist Branch</ENAMEX> of the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Counterterrorist Center</ENAMEX>. This <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX>, who was especially knowledgeable about
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>, had noticed a recent stream of reports about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> and something
                called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>, and suggested to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cohen</ENAMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">station</ENAMEX> focus on this one
                individual. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cohen</ENAMEX> agreed. Thus was born the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX>.
            
            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 1996</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> left <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sudan</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A few months later</TIMEX>, as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bin</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ladin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> was gearing up, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jamal Ahmed al Fadl</ENAMEX> walked into a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">embassy</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX>,
                established his bona fides as a former senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employee</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>, and provided a
                major breakthrough of intelligence on the creation, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX>, direction, and
                intentions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>. Corroborating evidence came from another walk-in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> at a
                different <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">embassy</ENAMEX>. More confirmation was supplied <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later that year</TIMEX> by
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intelligence</ENAMEX> and other sources, including <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">material</ENAMEX> gathered by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kenyan</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> from an <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nairobi</ENAMEX>.
            
            By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> recognized that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> was more than just
                a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">financier</ENAMEX>. They learned that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> had a military <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committee</ENAMEX> that was planning
                operations against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> interests worldwide and was actively trying to obtain
                nuclear material. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Analysts</ENAMEX> assigned to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">station</ENAMEX> looked at the information it had
                gathered and "found connections everywhere," including links to the attacks on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Aden</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Somalia</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992 and 1993</TIMEX> and to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manila</ENAMEX> air plot in the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philippines</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994-1995</TIMEX>.
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX> was already working on plans for offensive operations against
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>. These plans were directed at both physical assets and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of finance.
                In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end</TIMEX>, plans to identify and attack <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>'s money <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> did not go
                    forward.
            
            In late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> was still in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sudan</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>
                learned that <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Sudanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> were discussing with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Saudi</ENAMEX> government the
                possibility of expelling <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Ambassador</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Timothy Carney</ENAMEX> encouraged the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Sudanese</ENAMEX> to pursue this course. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saudis</ENAMEX>, however, did not want <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>, giving
                as their reason their revocation of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizenship</ENAMEX>.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sudan</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minister</ENAMEX> of defense, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fatih Erwa</ENAMEX>, has claimed that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sudan</ENAMEX> offered to hand Bin
                Ladin over to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> has found no credible evidence that
                this was so. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Ambassador</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carney</ENAMEX> had instructions only to push the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Sudanese</ENAMEX> to expel
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Ambassador</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carney</ENAMEX> had no legal basis to ask for more from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Sudanese</ENAMEX>
                since, at the time, there was no indictment outstanding.
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX>, whom we will call "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike</ENAMEX>," saw <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>'s move to
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> as a stroke of luck. Though the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> had virtually abandoned <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>
                after the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviet</ENAMEX> withdrawal, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">case officers</ENAMEX> had reestablished old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contacts</ENAMEX> while
                tracking down <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mir Amal Kansi</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pakistani</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gunman</ENAMEX> who had murdered <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 1993</TIMEX>. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contacts</ENAMEX> contributed to intelligence about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bin</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ladin</ENAMEX>'s local movements, business activities, and security and living arrangements,
                and helped provide evidence that he was spending large amounts of money to help the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Counterterrorist Center</ENAMEX>, whom we will call "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeff</ENAMEX>," told
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Tenet</ENAMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>'s intelligence assets were "near to providing
                real-time information about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>'s activities and travels in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>." One
                of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">contacts</ENAMEX> was a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> associated with particular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tribes</ENAMEX> among <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>'s
                ethnic <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pashtun</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX>.
            
            By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fall of 1997</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> had roughed out a plan for these <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Afghan</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tribals</ENAMEX> to capture <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> and hand him over for trial either in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>
                or in an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 1998</TIMEX>, the cabinet-level <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Principals Committee</ENAMEX>
                apparently gave the concept its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blessing</ENAMEX>.
            
            On their own separate <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">track</ENAMEX>, getting information but not direction from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>, the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Field Office</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Attorney</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southern District of New</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">York</ENAMEX> were preparing to ask a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">grand jury</ENAMEX> to indict <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>. The Counterterrorist
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center</ENAMEX> knew that this was happening.
            
            The eventual charge, conspiring to attack <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> defense installations, was finally
                issued from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">grand jury</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 1998-</TIMEX>as a sealed indictment. The indictment was
                publicly disclosed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November of that year</TIMEX>.
            When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> moved to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 1996</TIMEX>, he became a subject of interest to
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Asia</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bureau</ENAMEX>. At the time, as one <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diplomat</ENAMEX> told us,
                <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Asia</ENAMEX> was seen in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> generally as a low
                priority. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madeleine Albright</ENAMEX> was beginning her tenure as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX> of
                state, an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSC</ENAMEX> policy review concluded that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> should pay more
                attention not just to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> but also to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>.
            
            With regard to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>, another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diplomat</ENAMEX> said, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> at the time had
                "no policy."
            
            In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX>, concerns about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> tensions often crowded out
                attention to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>. Aware of instability and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RESPONSES TO AL</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QAEDA</ENAMEX>'S <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">INITIAL ASSAULTS 111</ENAMEX> growing <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Islamic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">extremism</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> worried most about an arms race and possible war between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> and
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>. After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 1998</TIMEX>, when both <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> surprised the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> by testing
                nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX>, these dangers became daily first-order concerns of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State</ENAMEX>
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Department</ENAMEX>.
            
            In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX> tried to end the civil war that had continued
                since the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviets</ENAMEX>' withdrawal. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Asia</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bureau</ENAMEX> believed it might have a carrot
                for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>'s warring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">factions</ENAMEX> in a project by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Union Oil Company</ENAMEX> of
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UNOCAL</ENAMEX>) to build a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pipeline</ENAMEX> across the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. While there was probably
                never much chance of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pipeline</ENAMEX> actually being built, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Afghan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">desk</ENAMEX> hoped that
                the prospect of shared pipeline profits might lure <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">faction leaders</ENAMEX> to a conference
                table.<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diplomats</ENAMEX> did not favor the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX> over the rival <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">factions</ENAMEX>. Despite
                growing concerns, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diplomats</ENAMEX> were willing at the time, as one <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> said, to
                "give the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX> a chance."
            
            Though <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albright</ENAMEX> made no secret of thinking the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX> "despicable," the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ambassador</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Nations</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Richardson</ENAMEX>, led a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">delegation</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX>-including <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>-in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 1998</TIMEX>. No <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> of such rank had been to
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kabul</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Ambassador</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richardson</ENAMEX> went primarily to urge negotiations to end
                the civil war. In view of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>'s recent public call for all <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslims</ENAMEX> to kill
                <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richardson</ENAMEX> asked the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX> to expel <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>. They answered that they
                did not know his whereabouts. In any case, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX> said, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> was not a
                threat to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>.
            
            In sum, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late 1997 and the spring of 1998</TIMEX>, the lead <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> each pursued
                their own efforts against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Counterterrorist Center</ENAMEX> was
                developing a plan to capture and remove him from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>. Parts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Department</ENAMEX> were moving toward indicting <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>, making possible a criminal trial
                in a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX>. Meanwhile, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX> was focused more on lessening
                Indo-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pakistani</ENAMEX> nuclear tensions, ending the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Afghan</ENAMEX> civil war, and ameliorating the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX>'s human rights abuses than on driving out <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>. Another key <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">actor</ENAMEX>,
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marine General Anthony Zinni</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commander in chief</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Central Command</ENAMEX>,
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">shared the State Department</ENAMEX>'s view.
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> Develops a <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Capture Plan Initially</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DCI</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Counterterrorist Center</ENAMEX> and its
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> considered a plan to ambush <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> when he traveled between
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kandahar</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Taliban</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> where he sometimes stayed <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the night</TIMEX>, and his primary
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">residence at the time, Tarnak Farms</ENAMEX>. After the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Afghan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tribals</ENAMEX> reported that they had
                tried such an ambush and failed, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center</ENAMEX> gave up on it, despite suspicions that
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tribals</ENAMEX>' story might be fiction. Thereafter, the capture plan focused on a
                <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">nighttime</ENAMEX> raid on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tarnak Farms</ENAMEX>.
            
            A <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">compound</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 80</NUMEX> concrete or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mud</ENAMEX>-brick <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> surrounded by a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10-foot</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wall</ENAMEX>,
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tarnak Farms</ENAMEX> was located in an isolated desert area on the outskirts of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kandahar</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">airport</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> were able to map the entire site, identifying the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> that
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">belonged to Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wives</ENAMEX> and the one where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> himself was most likely to
                sleep. Working with the tribals, they drew up plans for the raid. They ran two
                complete rehearsals in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fall of 1997</TIMEX>.
            
            By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 1998</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planners</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Counterterrorist Center</ENAMEX> were ready to come back to the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> to seek formal approval. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tenet</ENAMEX> apparently walked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Security</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Advisor Sandy Berger</ENAMEX> through the basic plan on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February 13</TIMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of tribals
                would subdue the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guards</ENAMEX>, enter Tarnak <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Farms stealthily</ENAMEX>, grab <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>, take him to
                a desert <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">site</ENAMEX> outside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kandahar</ENAMEX>, and turn him over to a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. This second
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> of tribals would take him to a desert landing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">zone</ENAMEX> already tested in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>
                Kansi capture. From there, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> would take him to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX>,
                or wherever he was to be arraigned. Briefing papers prepared by the Counterterrorist
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center</ENAMEX> acknowledged that hitches might develop. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">People</ENAMEX> might be killed, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bin</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ladin</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supporters</ENAMEX> might retaliate, perhaps taking <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kandahar</ENAMEX>
                hostage. But the briefing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX> also noted that there was risk in not acting.
                "Sooner or later," they said, "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> will attack <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> interests, perhaps using
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WMD</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX> of mass destruction]."
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Counterterrorism Security Group</ENAMEX> reviewed the capture plan for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX>. Noting
                that the plan was in a "very early stage of development," the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> then told
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planners</ENAMEX> to go ahead and, among other things, start drafting any legal
                documents that might be required to authorize the covert action. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSG</ENAMEX> apparently
                stressed that the raid should target <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> himself, not the whole compound.
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planners</ENAMEX> conducted their <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> complete rehearsal in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX>, and they again
                briefed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSG</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> wrote <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 7</TIMEX> that he saw the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX> as
                "somewhat embryonic" and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> as "<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> away from doing anything."
            
            "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike"</ENAMEX> thought the capture plan was "the perfect operation." It required minimum
                infrastructure. The plan had now been modified so that the tribals would keep Bin
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ladin</ENAMEX> in a hiding place for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">up to a month</TIMEX> before turning him over to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX>-thereby increasing the chances of keeping the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hand</ENAMEX> out of sight." <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike</ENAMEX>"
                trusted the information from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Afghan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX>; it had been corroborated by other
                means, he told us. The lead <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> in the field, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gary Schroen</ENAMEX>, also had
                confidence in the tribals. In a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 6</TIMEX> cable to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX>, he pronounced their
                planning "almost as professional and detailed . . . as would be done by any <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
                military special operations element." He and the other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> who had worked
                through the plan with the tribals judged it "about as good as it can be." (By that,
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schroen</ENAMEX> explained, he meant that the chance of capturing or killing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> was
                <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 40 percent</NUMEX>.) Although the tribals thought they could pull off the raid, if the
                operation were approved by <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX> and the policymakers, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schroen</ENAMEX> wrote there
                was going to be a point when "we step back and keep our fingers crossed that the
                [<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tribals</ENAMEX>] prove as good (and as lucky) as they think they will be."
            
            Military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> reviewed the capture plan and, according to "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike</ENAMEX>," "found no
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">showstoppers</ENAMEX>." The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commander</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta Force</ENAMEX> felt "uncomfortable" with having the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tribals</ENAMEX> hold <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> captive for so long, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commander</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joint Special</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Operations Forces</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lieutenant General</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Canavan</ENAMEX>, was worried about the safety
                of the tribals inside <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tarnak Farms</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Canavan</ENAMEX> said he had actually thought the
                operation too complicated for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>-"out of their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">league</ENAMEX>"-and an effort to get
                results "on the cheap." But a senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joint</ENAMEX> Staff <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> described the plan as
                "generally, not too much different than we might have come up with ourselves." No
                <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX>, so far as we know, advised the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> not to
                    proceed.
            
            In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX> expressed doubt about the dependability of the tribals. In his
                meeting with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tenet</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX> focused most, however, on the question of what was to be
                done with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> if he were actually captured. He worried that the hard evidence
                against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> was still skimpy and that there was a danger of snatching him and
                bringing him to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> only to see him acquitted.
            
            On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 18</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> reviewed a draft <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Memorandum of Notification</ENAMEX> (MON), a legal
                document authorizing the capture operation. A <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX> presidential finding had
                authorized worldwide covert action against terrorism and probably provided adequate
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">authority</ENAMEX>. But mindful of the old "rogue elephant" charge, senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> may
                have wanted something on paper to show that they were not acting on their own.
            Discussion of this memorandum brought to the surface an unease about paramilitary
                covert action that had become ingrained, at least among some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX>.
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Pavitt</ENAMEX>, the assistant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Directorate of Operations</ENAMEX>, expressed concern
                that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> might get killed; it appears he thought the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX> had at least a
                slight flavor of a plan for an assassination. Moreover, he calculated that it would
                cost <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">several million dollars</NUMEX>. He was not prepared to take that money "out of hide,"
                and he did not want to go to all the necessary congressional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committees</ENAMEX> to get
                special money. Despite <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pavitt</ENAMEX>'s misgivings, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> cleared the draft
                memorandum and sent it on to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Security Council</ENAMEX>.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Counterterrorist Center</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> briefed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Attorney General</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Janet Reno</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis Freeh</ENAMEX>, telling them that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX> had about a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 percent</NUMEX> chance of
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">success</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center</ENAMEX>'s chief, "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeff</ENAMEX>," joined <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John O'Neill</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>'s New
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">York Field Office</ENAMEX>, in briefing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Jo White</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Attorney</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern</ENAMEX>
                District of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>, and her staff. Though "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeff</ENAMEX> " also used the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 percent</NUMEX> success
                figure, he warned that someone would surely be killed in the operation. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">White</ENAMEX>'s
                impression from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> briefing was that the chances of capturing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>
                alive were nil.
            
            From <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 20 to 24</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> ran a final, graded rehearsal of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX>, spread
                over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> time zones, even bringing in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> from the region. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> also
                participated. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rehearsal</ENAMEX> went well. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Counterterrorist Center</ENAMEX> planned to brief
                cabinet-level <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principals</ENAMEX> and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">deputies</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the following week</TIMEX>, giving <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 23</TIMEX> as
                the date for the raid, with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> to be brought out of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> no later than
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 23</TIMEX>.
            
            On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 20</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tenet</ENAMEX> discussed the high risk of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX> and
                his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">deputies</ENAMEX>, warning that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> might be killed, including <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Success</ENAMEX> was
                to be defined as the exfiltration of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> out of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>.
            
            A meeting of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principals</ENAMEX> was scheduled for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 29</TIMEX> to decide whether the operation
                should go ahead.
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principals</ENAMEX> did not meet. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 29</TIMEX>, "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeff "</ENAMEX> informed "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike</ENAMEX>" that he had just met
                with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tenet, Pavitt</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Directorate</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Near Eastern Division</ENAMEX>. The
                decision was made not to go ahead with the operation." <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike</ENAMEX>" cabled the field that
                he had been directed to "stand down on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX> for the time being." He had
                been told, he wrote, that cabinet-level <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> thought the risk of civilian
                casualties-"collateral damage"-was too high. They were concerned about the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tribals</ENAMEX>'
                safety, and had worried that "the purpose and nature of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX> would be
                subject to unavoidable misinterpretation and misrepresentation-and probably
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recriminations</ENAMEX>-in the event that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>, despite our best intentions and efforts,
                did not survive."
            
            Impressions vary as to who actually decided not to proceed with the operation. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Clarke</ENAMEX>
                told us that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSG</ENAMEX> saw the plan as flawed. He was said to have described it to a
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleague</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> as "<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-assed" and predicted that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principals</ENAMEX> would
                not approve it. "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeff "</ENAMEX> thought the decision had been made at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cabinet</ENAMEX> level.
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pavitt</ENAMEX> thought that it was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX>'s doing, though perhaps on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tenet</ENAMEX>'s advice. Tenet
                told us that given the recommendation of his chief operations <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX>, he alone had
                decided to "turn off " the operation. He had simply informed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX>, who had not
                pushed back. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX>'s recollection was similar. He said the plan was never presented
                to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> for a decision.
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>'s senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> clearly did not think the plan would work. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tenet</ENAMEX>'s deputy
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> wrote to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few weeks later</TIMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> assessed the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tribals</ENAMEX>' ability to capture <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> and deliver him to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> as low. But
                working-level <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> were disappointed. Before it was canceled, Schroen
                described it as the "best plan we are going to come up with to capture [<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>]
                while he is in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> and bring him to justice."
            
            No capture plan before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9/11</TIMEX> ever again attained the same level of detail and
                preparation. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tribals</ENAMEX>' reported readiness to act diminished. And <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>'s
                security precautions and defenses became more elaborate and formidable. At this
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX> was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than three years</TIMEX> away. It was the duty of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tenet</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> to balance the risks of inaction against jeopardizing the lives of their
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>. And they had reason to worry about failure: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</NUMEX> of
                dollars down the drain; a shoot-out that could be seen as an assassination; and, if
                there were repercussions in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>, perhaps a coup. The decisions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
                government in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 1998</TIMEX> were made, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX> has put RESPONSES TO <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AL QAEDA</ENAMEX>'S INITIAL
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ASSAULTS 115</ENAMEX> it, from the vantage point of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">driver</ENAMEX> looking through a muddy
                windshield moving forward, not through a clean rearview mirror.
            
            Looking for Other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Options The Counterterrorist Center</ENAMEX> continued to track <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>
                and to contemplate covert action. The most hopeful possibility seemed now to lie in
                diplomacy- but not diplomacy managed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of State</ENAMEX>, which focused
                primarily on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> nuclear tensions during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer of 1998</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>
                learned in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the spring of 1998</TIMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Saudi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> had quietly disrupted Bin
                Ladin <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> in its <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> that were planning to attack <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> with
                shoulder-fired <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missiles</ENAMEX>. They had arrested scores of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>, with no publicity.
                When thanking the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saudis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tenet</ENAMEX> took advantage of the opening to ask them
                to help against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>. The response was encouraging enough that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">President</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> made Tenet his informal personal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> to work with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saudis</ENAMEX> on
                terrorism, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tenet</ENAMEX> visited <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Riyadh</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX> and again in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early June</TIMEX>.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Saudi</ENAMEX> Crown <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prince</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abdullah</ENAMEX>, who had taken charge from the ailing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fahd</ENAMEX>, promised
                Tenet an all-out secret effort to persuade the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX> to expel <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> so that he
                could be sent to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> or to another <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> for trial. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kingdom</ENAMEX>'s
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">emissary</ENAMEX> would be its intelligence <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prince</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Turki bin Faisal</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> later added his thanks to those of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tenet</ENAMEX>, both making clear that they spoke
                with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s blessing. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tenet</ENAMEX> reported that it was imperative to get an
                indictment against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">grand jury</ENAMEX> issued its sealed indictment a
                few <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days later</TIMEX>, on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 10</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tenet</ENAMEX> also recommended that no action be taken on other
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> options, such as the covert action plan.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prince Turki</ENAMEX> followed up in meetings during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mullah Omar</ENAMEX> and other
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX>. Apparently employing a mixture of possible incentives and threats,
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Turki</ENAMEX> received a commitment that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> would be expelled, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mullah Omar</ENAMEX> did
                not make good on this promise.
            
            On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 5</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> chaired a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSG</ENAMEX> meeting on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>. In the discussion of what
                might be done, the note taker wrote, "there was a dearth of bright ideas around the
                table, despite a consensus that the [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>] ought to pursue every <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">avenue</ENAMEX> it can
                to address the problem."
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">CRISIS: AUGUST 1998</ENAMEX> 
            On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 7, 1998</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Security Advisor Berger</ENAMEX> woke <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> with a
                phone call at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5:35 A.M.</TIMEX> to tell him of the almost simultaneous bombings of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">embassies</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nairobi</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kenya</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dar es Salaam</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tanzania</ENAMEX>. Suspicion quickly focused
                on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>. Unusually good intelligence, chiefly from the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yearlong</TIMEX> monitoring of
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nairobi</ENAMEX>, soon firmly fixed responsibility on him and his
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">associates</ENAMEX>.
            
            Debate about what to do settled very soon on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> option: Tomahawk cruise <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missiles</ENAMEX>.
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Months earlier</TIMEX>, after cancellation of the covert capture operation, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> had
                prodded the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> to explore possibilities for military action. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 2</TIMEX>,
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hugh Shelton</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joint Chiefs of Staff</ENAMEX>, had directed
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Zinni</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central Command</ENAMEX> to develop a plan, which he had submitted during
                the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">first week of July</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zinni</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planners</ENAMEX> surely considered the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> previous times
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> had used <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> to respond to terrorism, the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX> strike on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Libya</ENAMEX>
                and the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX> strike against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX>. They proposed firing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tomahawks</ENAMEX> against eight
                terrorist <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camps</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">compound</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tarnak Farms</ENAMEX>.
            
            After the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">embassy</ENAMEX> attacks, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> offered this plan to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>.
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">The day</TIMEX> after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">embassy</ENAMEX> bombings, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tenet</ENAMEX> brought to a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principals</ENAMEX> meeting
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intelligence</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorist leaders</ENAMEX> were expected to gather at a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camp</ENAMEX> near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Khowst</ENAMEX>,
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>, to plan future attacks. According to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tenet</ENAMEX> said that several
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hundred</ENAMEX> would attend, including <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> described the area as effectively
                a military cantonment, away from civilian <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> centers and overwhelmingly
                populated by jihadists. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> remembered sitting next to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tenet</ENAMEX> in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>
                meeting, asking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tenet</ENAMEX> "You thinking what I'm thinking?" and his nodding "yes." The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principals</ENAMEX> quickly reached a consensus on attacking
                the gathering. The strike's purpose was to kill <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> and his chief
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lieutenants</ENAMEX>.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX> put in place a tightly compartmented process designed to keep all planning
                secret. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 11</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Zinni</ENAMEX> received orders to prepare detailed plans for
                strikes against the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> briefed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>
                about these plans on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 12 and 14</TIMEX>. Though the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principals</ENAMEX> hoped that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missiles</ENAMEX>
                would hit <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> recommended the strike whether or not there was firm
                evidence that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commanders</ENAMEX> were at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX>.
            
            Considerable debate went to the question of whether to strike <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> outside of
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>, including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sudan</ENAMEX>. One was a tannery believed to belong
                to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>. The other was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Shifa</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Khartoum</ENAMEX> pharmaceutical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>, which
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intelligence</ENAMEX> reports said was manufacturing a precursor <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ingredient</ENAMEX> for nerve gas
                with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>'s financial support. The argument for hitting the tannery was that it
                could hurt <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> financially. The argument for hitting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Shifa</ENAMEX> was that it
                would lessen the chance of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>'s having nerve <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> for a later attack.
            
            Ever since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 1995</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> had had in the backs of their minds Aum
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shinrikyo</ENAMEX>'s release of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sarin nerve gas</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">subway</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>
                himself had expressed great concern about chemical and biological terrorism in the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> had reportedly been heard to speak of wanting a
                "<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hiroshima</ENAMEX>"and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 10,000</NUMEX> casualties. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> reported RESPONSES TO <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AL QAEDA</ENAMEX>'S
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">INITIAL ASSAULTS 117</ENAMEX> that a soil sample from the vicinity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Shifa</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> had
                tested positive for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EMPTA</ENAMEX>, a precursor chemical for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VX</ENAMEX>, a nerve gas whose lone use
                was for mass killing. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Two days</TIMEX> before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">embassy</ENAMEX> bombings, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> wrote
                that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> "has invested in and almost certainly has access to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VX</ENAMEX> produced at a
                <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sudan</ENAMEX>." Senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>
                believed that they had received a similar verdict independently, though they and
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> were probably relying on the same report. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary McCarthy</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSC</ENAMEX>
                senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> responsible for intelligence programs, initially cautioned <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX>
                that the "bottom line" was that "we will need much better intelligence on this
                <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> before we seriously consider any options." She added that the link between
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Shifa</ENAMEX> was "rather uncertain at this point." <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX> has told us that
                he thought about what might happen if the decision went against hitting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Shifa</ENAMEX>,
                and nerve <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> was used in a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">subway</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks later</TIMEX>.
            
            By <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the early hours of the morning</TIMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 20</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> and all his
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principal advisers</ENAMEX> had agreed to strike <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">camps</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Khowst</ENAMEX>,
                as well as hitting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Shifa</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> took the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Sudanese</ENAMEX> tannery off the target
                list because he saw little point in killing uninvolved <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> without doing
                significant harm to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principal</ENAMEX> with the most qualms regarding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Shifa</ENAMEX>
                was <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Attorney General</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reno</ENAMEX>. She expressed concern about attacking <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> at the same time. Looking back, she said that she felt the "premise kept
                    shifting."
            
            Later on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 20</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabian Sea</ENAMEX> fired their cruise <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missiles</ENAMEX>.
                Though most of them hit their intended <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">targets</ENAMEX>, neither <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> nor any other
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorist leader</ENAMEX> was killed. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX> told us that an after-action review by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tenet</ENAMEX> concluded that the strikes had killed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20-30</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camps</ENAMEX> but probably
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">missed Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a few hours</TIMEX>. Since the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missiles</ENAMEX> headed for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> had had
                to cross <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice Chairman</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joint Chiefs</ENAMEX> was sent to meet with
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>'s army <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief of staff</ENAMEX> to assure him the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missiles</ENAMEX> were not coming from
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Officials</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> speculated that one or another <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pakistani</ENAMEX> official
                might have sent a warning to the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Taliban or Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>.
            
            The air strikes marked the climax of an intense <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">48-hour</TIMEX> period in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Berger</ENAMEX>
                notified congressional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principals</ENAMEX> called their foreign counterparts,
                and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> flew back from his vacation on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martha</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Vineyard</ENAMEX> to address
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">nation</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oval Office</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> spoke to the congressional leadership
                from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force One</ENAMEX>, and he called <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prime Minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tony Blair</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pakistani</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prime</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nawaz Sharif</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Egyptian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hosni Mubarak</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White</ENAMEX>
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">House.</ENAMEX>
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Speaker</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Newt Gingrich</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Majority Leader</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trent Lott</ENAMEX> initially supported
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX>. The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next month</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gingrich</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> dismissed the cruise <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missile</ENAMEX>
                attacks as "pinpricks."
            
            At the time, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> was embroiled in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewinsky</ENAMEX> scandal, which continued
                to consume public attention for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the rest of that year</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first months of 1999</TIMEX>.
                As it happened, a popular <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX> movie, <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Wag the Dog</ENAMEX>, features a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">president</ENAMEX> who fakes a
                war to distract public attention from a domestic scandal. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Republicans</ENAMEX> in
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> raised questions about the timing of the strikes. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX> was particularly
                rankled by an editorial in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Economist</ENAMEX> that said that only the future would tell
                whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> missile strikes had "created <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX> new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fanatics</ENAMEX> where there would
                have been none."
            
            Much public commentary turned immediately to scalding criticism that the action was
                too aggressive. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Sudanese</ENAMEX> denied that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Shifa</ENAMEX> produced nerve <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX>, and they
                allowed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">journalists</ENAMEX> to visit what was left of a seemingly harmless <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX>.
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tenet</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> insisted to us
                that their judgment was right, pointing to the soil sample evidence. No independent
                evidence has emerged to corroborate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>'s assessment.
            
            Everyone involved in the decision had, of course, been aware of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s
                problems. He told them to ignore them. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX> recalled the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> saying to him
                "that they were going to get crap either way, so they should do the right
                    thing." All his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aides</ENAMEX> testified to us that they based
                their advice solely on national security considerations. We have found no reason to
                question their statements.
            The failure of the strikes, the "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wag</ENAMEX> the dog" slur, the intense partisanship of the
                period, and the nature of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Shifa</ENAMEX> evidence likely had a cumulative effect on
                future decisions about the use of force against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX> told us that he
                did not feel any sense of constraint.
            
            The period after the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 1998</TIMEX> embassy bombings was critical in shaping <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> policy
                toward <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>. Although more <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> had been killed in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> KhobarTowers
                attack, and many more in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beirut</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1983</TIMEX>, the overall loss of life rivaled the worst
                attacks in memory. More ominous, perhaps, was the demonstration of an operational
                capability to coordinate <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> nearly simultaneous attacks on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">embassies</ENAMEX> in
                different <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>.
            Despite the availability of information that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> was a global <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">policymakers</ENAMEX> knew little about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>. The reams of new information that
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> had been developing since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> had not been pulled together
                and synthesized for the rest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>. Indeed, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> felt
                that they were viewed as alarmists even within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Intelligence</ENAMEX>
                Estimate on terrorism in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX> had only briefly mentioned <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>, and no
                subsequent national estimate would authoritatively evaluate the terrorism danger
                until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">after 9/11</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Policymakers</ENAMEX> knew there was a dangerous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Usama Bin</ENAMEX>
                Ladin, whom they had been trying to capture and bring to trial. Documents at the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> referred to <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> "and his associates" or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> and his "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX>." They
                did not emphasize the existence of a structured worldwide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> gearing up to
                train <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX>.
            
            In the critical <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX> after the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 1998</TIMEX> attacks, senior policymakers in
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> had to reevaluate the threat posed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bin RESPONSES TO AL</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QAEDA</ENAMEX>'S <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">INITIAL ASSAULTS 119 Ladin</ENAMEX>. Was this just a new and especially venomous
                version of the ordinary terrorist threat <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> had lived with for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX>, or was
                it radically new, posing a danger beyond any yet experienced?
            Even after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">embassy</ENAMEX> attacks, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> had been responsible for the deaths of
                fewer than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>, most of them overseas. An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staffer</ENAMEX> working for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> told us the threat was seen as one that could cause <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of casualties,
                not <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX>.
            
            Even <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> who acknowledge a vital threat intellectually may not be ready to act
                on such beliefs at great cost or at high risk.
            Therefore, the government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> who believed that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> posed
                such a novel danger needed a way to win broad support for their views, or at least
                spotlight the areas of dispute. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Presidential Daily Brief</ENAMEX> and the similar, more
                widely circulated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> reports for high <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>-consisting mainly of brief
                reports of intelligence "news" without much analysis or context- did not provide
                such a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicle</ENAMEX>. The national intelligence estimate has often played this role, and
                is sometimes controversial for this very reason. It played no role in judging the
                threat posed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>, either in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX> or later. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late summer</TIMEX> and fall of
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> also was worrying about the deployment of military power
                in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> other ongoing conflicts. After years of war in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Balkans</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>
                had finally committed itself to significant military intervention in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995-1996</TIMEX>.
                Already maintaining a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX>-led peacekeeping <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">force</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bosnia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> were
                beginning to consider major combat <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Serbia</ENAMEX> to protect <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kosovo</ENAMEX> from ethnic cleansing. Air strikes were threatened in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX>
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>; a full-scale <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX> bombing campaign against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Serbia</ENAMEX> was launched in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX>
                    <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>.
            
            In addition, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> was facing the possibility of major combat
                operations against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX>. Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UN</ENAMEX> inspections <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX> had been increasingly
                obstructed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> was threatening to attack unless
                unfettered inspections could resume. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> eventually launched
                a large-scale set of air strikes against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Operation Desert Fox</ENAMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December</TIMEX>
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>. These military commitments became the context in which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinton</ENAMEX>
                administration had to consider opening another front of military engagement against
                a new terrorist threat based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>.
            A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Follow-On Campaign</ENAMEX>?
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> hoped the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 1998</TIMEX> missile strikes would mark the beginning of a sustained
                campaign against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> was, as he later admitted, "obsessed" with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bin</ENAMEX>
                Ladin, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">embassy</ENAMEX> bombings gave him new scope for pursuing his obsession.
                Terrorism had moved high up among the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX>'s concerns, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX>'s position
                had elevated accordingly. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSG</ENAMEX>, unlike most standing interagency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committees</ENAMEX>, did
                not have to report through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deputies Committee</ENAMEX>. Although such a reporting
                relationship had been prescribed in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 1998</TIMEX> presidential directive (after
                expressions of concern by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Attorney General</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reno</ENAMEX>, among others), that directive
                contained an exception that permitted the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSG</ENAMEX> to report directly to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principals</ENAMEX>
                if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Berger</ENAMEX> so elected. In practice, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSG</ENAMEX> often reported not even to the full
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Principals Committee</ENAMEX> but instead to the so-called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Small Group</ENAMEX> formed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX>,
                consisting only of those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principals</ENAMEX> cleared to know about the most sensitive issues
                connected with counterterrorism activities concerning <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Khobar Towers</ENAMEX>
                    investigation.
            
            For this inner <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cabinet</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> drew up what he called "Political-Military Plan
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delenda</ENAMEX>." The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Latin</ENAMEX> delenda, meaning that something "must be destroyed," evoked the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">famous Roman</ENAMEX> vow to destroy its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">rival</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Carthage</ENAMEX>. The overall goal of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX>'s paper
                was to "immediately eliminate any significant threat to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>" from the "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bin</ENAMEX>
                Ladin network."57The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> called for diplomacy to deny <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">sanctuary</ENAMEX>; covert
                action to disrupt terrorist activities, but above all to capture <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> and his
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">deputies</ENAMEX> and bring them to trial; efforts to dry up <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>'s money supply; and
                preparation for follow-on military action. The status of the document was and
                remained uncertain. It was never formally adopted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principals</ENAMEX>, and
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Small Group</ENAMEX> now have little or no recollection of it. It did,
                however, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guide</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX>'s efforts. The military component of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX>'s plan was its
                most fully articulated element. He envisioned an ongoing campaign of strikes against
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> or elsewhere, whenever target information was ripe.
                Acknowledging that individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> might not have much value, he cautioned <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX>
                not to expect ever again to have an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorist leaders</ENAMEX> in his sights. But
                he argued that rolling attacks might persuade the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX> to hand over <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>
                and, in any case, would show that the action in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August</TIMEX> was not a "oneoff " event. It
                would show that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> was committed to a relentless effort to take down
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>'s network.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Small Group</ENAMEX> found themselves unpersuaded of the merits of rolling
                attacks. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Cohen</ENAMEX> told us <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>'s training <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camps</ENAMEX> were
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">primitive</ENAMEX>, built with "rope ladders"; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Shelton</ENAMEX> called them "jungle gym"
                camps. Neither thought them worthwhile targets for very expensive <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missiles</ENAMEX>.
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX> also worried about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Economist</ENAMEX>'s point-that attacks
                that missed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> could enhance his stature and win him new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recruits</ENAMEX>. After the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX> launched air attacks against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of 1998</TIMEX> and against
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Serbia</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>, in each case provoking worldwide criticism, Deputy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Security</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Advisor James Steinberg</ENAMEX> added the argument that attacks in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> offered
                "little benefit, lots of blowback against [a] <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bomb</ENAMEX>-happy <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>"
            
            During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last week of August 1998</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> began considering possible follow-on
                strikes. According to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> was inclined to launch further
                strikes sooner rather than later. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 27</TIMEX>, Under <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense</ENAMEX> for
                Policy <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter Slocombe</ENAMEX> advised <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cohen</ENAMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">availRESPONSES</ENAMEX> TO <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AL QAEDA</ENAMEX>'S
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">INITIAL ASSAULTS 121</ENAMEX> able <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> were not promising. The experience of the previous
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week</TIMEX>, he wrote, "has only confirmed the importance of defining a clearly articulated
                rationale for military action" that was effective as well as justified. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Slocombe</ENAMEX>
                worried that simply striking some of these available targets did not add up to an
                effective strategy.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> at a lower level, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Assistant Secretary</ENAMEX> for
                Special <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Operations</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Low-Intensity Conflict</ENAMEX>, tried to meet <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Slocombe</ENAMEX>'s objections.
                They developed a plan that, unlike <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX>'s, called not for particular strikes but
                instead for a broad change in national strategy and in the institutional approach of
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Defense</ENAMEX>, implying a possible need for large-scale operations
                across the whole spectrum of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> military capabilities. It urged the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> to
                become a lead <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> in driving a national counterterrorism strategy forward, to
                "champion a national effort to take up the gauntlet that international <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX>
                have thrown at our feet." The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> expressed concern that "we have not
                fundamentally altered our philosophy or our approach" even though the terrorist
                threat had grown. They outlined an <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX>-part strategy "to be more proactive and
                aggressive." The future, they warned, might bring "horrific attacks," in which case
                "we will have no choice nor, unfortunately, will we have a plan." The assistant
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allen Holmes</ENAMEX>, took the paper to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Slocombe</ENAMEX>'s chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">deputy</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jan Lodal</ENAMEX>, but
                it went no further. Its lead <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> recalls being told by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Holmes</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lodal</ENAMEX> thought
                it was too aggressive. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Holmes</ENAMEX> cannot recall what was said, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lodal</ENAMEX> cannot remember
                the episode or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> at all.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DIPLOMACY</ENAMEX>
            After the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August</TIMEX> missile strikes, diplomatic options to press the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX> seemed no
                more promising than military options. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> had issued a formal warning
                to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX>, and also to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sudan</ENAMEX>, that they would be held directly responsible for
                any attacks on <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>, wherever they occurred, carried out by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>
                network as long as they continued to provide <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">sanctuary</ENAMEX> to it.
            
            For a brief moment, it had seemed as if the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August</TIMEX> strikes might have shocked the
                Taliban into thinking of giving up <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 22</TIMEX>, the reclusive Mullah
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Omar</ENAMEX> told a working-level <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> that the strikes were
                counterproductive but added that he would be open to a dialogue with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>'s presence in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>.
            
            Meeting in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Islamabad</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Milam</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ambassador</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>, Taliban
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">delegates</ENAMEX> said it was against their culture to expel someone seeking <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">sanctuary</ENAMEX> but
                asked what would happen to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> should he be sent to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX>.
            
            Yet in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 1998</TIMEX>, when the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Saudi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emissary</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prince</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Turki</ENAMEX>, asked <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mullah Omar</ENAMEX>
                whether he would keep his earlier promise to expel <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Taliban</ENAMEX> leader
                said no. Both sides shouted at each other, with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mullah Omar</ENAMEX> denouncing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saudi</ENAMEX>
                government. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Riyadh</ENAMEX> then suspended its diplomatic relations with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taliban</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>.
                (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United Arab Emirates</ENAMEX> were the only <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> that
                recognized the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX> as the legitimate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>.) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crown Prince</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abdullah</ENAMEX> told <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> about this when he visited
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late September</TIMEX>. His account confirmed reports that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> government
                had received independently.
            
            Other efforts with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Saudi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> centered on improving intelligence sharing
                and permitting <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> to interrogate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoners</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Saudi</ENAMEX> custody. The history of
                such cooperation in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997 and 1998</TIMEX> had been strained.
            
            Several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> told us, in particular, that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> could not get direct
                access to an important <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> financial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madani al Tayyib</ENAMEX>, who had been
                detained by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Saudi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997.67Though</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> repeatedly raised
                the issue, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saudis</ENAMEX> provided limited information. In his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 1998</TIMEX> meeting
                with Crown <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prince</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abdullah</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Vice President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX>, while thanking the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Saudi</ENAMEX> government
                for their responsiveness, renewed the request for direct <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> access to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tayyib</ENAMEX>.
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> never obtained this access. An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>-led working <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> on
                terrorist finances asked the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November 1998</TIMEX> to push again for access to Tayyib
                and to see "if it is possible to elaborate further on the ties between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Usama</ENAMEX> bin
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ladin</ENAMEX> and prominent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX>, including especially the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>
                    family." One result was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSC</ENAMEX>-led interagency trips
                to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Persian Gulf</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999 and 2000</TIMEX>. During these trips the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSC</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX>, and
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intelligence</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> spoke with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Saudi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>, and later interviewed
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Usama</ENAMEX>'s inheritance. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saudis</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bin</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ladin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> eventually helped in this particular effort and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>
                ultimately learned that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> was not financing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> out of a personal
                    inheritance.
            
            But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> was frustrated about how little the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agency</ENAMEX> knew, complaining to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Berger</ENAMEX>
                that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four years</TIMEX> after "we first asked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> to track down [<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>]'s finances" and
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</TIMEX> after the creation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agency</ENAMEX> said it could
                only guess at how much aid <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> gave to terrorist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, what were the main
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of his budget, or how he moved his money.
            
            The other diplomatic route to get at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> ran through <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Islamabad</ENAMEX>.
                In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX> before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">embassy</ENAMEX> bombings, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX> had been heavily
                focused on rising tensions between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> and did not aggressively
                challenge <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>. But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX>
                counterterrorism <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> wanted a stronger position; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX>'s acting
                counterterrorism <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coordinator</ENAMEX> advised <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albright</ENAMEX> to designate <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> as a
                state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sponsor</ENAMEX> of terrorism, noting that despite high-level <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pakistani</ENAMEX> assurances, the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>'s military intelligence service continued "activities in support of
                international terrorism"by supporting attacks on civilian <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kashmir</ENAMEX>. This
                recommendation was opposed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Asia</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bureau</ENAMEX>, which was
                concerned that it would damage already RESPONSES TO <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AL QAEDA</ENAMEX>'S <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">INITIAL ASSAULTS 123</ENAMEX>
                sensitive relations with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> in the wake of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 1998</TIMEX> nuclear tests by both
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albright</ENAMEX> rejected the recommendation on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 5</TIMEX>,
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">just two days</TIMEX> before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">embassy</ENAMEX> bombings.
            
            She told us that, in general, putting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pakistanis</ENAMEX> on the terrorist list would
                eliminate any influence the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> had over them.
            
            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSC</ENAMEX> counterterrorism <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> noted that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>'s pro-Taliban
                military intelligence service had been training <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kashmiri</ENAMEX> jihadists in one of the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">camps</ENAMEX> hit by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missiles</ENAMEX>, leading to the death of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pakistanis</ENAMEX>.
            
            After flying to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nairobi</ENAMEX> and bringing home the coffins of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> dead, Secretary
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albright</ENAMEX> increased the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX>'s focus on counterterrorism. According to
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Ambassador</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milam</ENAMEX>, the bombings were a "wake-up call," and he soon found himself
                spending <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">45 to 50 percent</NUMEX> of his time working the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Taliban- Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> portfolio.
            
            But <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>'s military intelligence service, known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ISID</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inter-Services</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelligence Directorate</ENAMEX>), was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX>'s primary patron, which made progress
                difficult.
            Additional pressure on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistanis</ENAMEX>-beyond demands to press theTaliban on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bin</ENAMEX>
                Ladin-seemed unattractive to most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX>. Congressional
                sanctions punishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> for possessing nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX> prevented the
                administration from offering incentives to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Islamabad</ENAMEX>.
            
            In the words of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Deputy Secretary of State</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Strobe Talbott</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>
                policy was "stick-heavy." <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Talbott</ENAMEX> felt that the only remaining sticks were
                additional sanctions that would have bankrupted the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pakistanis</ENAMEX>, a dangerous move
                that could have brought "total chaos" to a nuclear-armed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> with a significant
                number of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Islamic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">radicals</ENAMEX>.
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Saudi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>, which had a long and close relationship with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> and
                provided it oil on generous terms, was already pressing <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sharif</ENAMEX> with regard to the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>. A senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> concluded that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saudi Crown</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prince Abdullah</ENAMEX> put "a tremendous amount of heat" on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pakistani</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prime minister</ENAMEX>
                during the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prince</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 1998</TIMEX> visit to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>.
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX> urged <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> to engage the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pakistanis</ENAMEX>. Accepting this
                advice, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> invited <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sharif</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>, where they talked mostly
                about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> but also discussed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>. After <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sharif</ENAMEX> went home, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">President</ENAMEX>
                called him and raised the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> subject again. This effort elicited from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sharif</ENAMEX>
                a promise to talk with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX>.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mullah</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Omar</ENAMEX>'s position showed no sign of softening. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> intelligence report passed to
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> quoted <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> as saying that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mullah Omar</ENAMEX> had given him a
                completely free hand to act in any <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, though asking that he not claim
                responsibility for attacks in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> was described as
                grabbing his beard and saying emotionally, "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">By Allah</ENAMEX>, by God, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX> will
                still be amazed. The so-called <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> will suffer the same fate as the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russians</ENAMEX>. Their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> will collapse, too."
            
            Debate in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX> intensified after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 1998</TIMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Sheehan</ENAMEX>
                became counterterrorism <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coordinator</ENAMEX>. A onetime special <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces officer</ENAMEX>, he had worked
                with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albright</ENAMEX> when she was <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ambassador</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Nations</ENAMEX> and had served on the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX>. He shared <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX>'s obsession with terrorism, and had little
                hesitation about locking horns with the regional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bureaus</ENAMEX>. Through every available
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">channel</ENAMEX>, he repeated the earlier warning to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX> of the possible dire
                consequences-including military strikes-if <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> remained their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guest</ENAMEX> and
                conducted additional attacks. Within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX>, he argued for designating the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX> a state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sponsor</ENAMEX> of terrorism. This was technically difficult to do,
                for calling it a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> would be tantamount to diplomatic recognition, which the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX> had thus far withheld. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sheehan</ENAMEX> urged the use of any available
                weapon against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX>. He told us that he thought he was regarded in the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> as "a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-note <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnny</ENAMEX> nutcase."
            
            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 1999</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX>'s counterterrorism <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> proposed a
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comprehensive</ENAMEX> diplomatic strategy for all <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> involved in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>
                problem, including <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>. It specified both carrots and hard-hitting sticks-
                among them, certifying <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> as uncooperative on terrorism. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albright</ENAMEX> said the
                original carrots and sticks listed in a decision paper for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principals</ENAMEX> may not have
                been used as "described on paper" but added that they were used in other ways or in
                varying degrees. But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Ambassador</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sheehan</ENAMEX>, was frustrated and
                complained to us that the original plan "had been watered down to the point that
                nothing was then done with it."
            
            The cautiousness of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Asia</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bureau</ENAMEX> was reinforced when, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 1999</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pakistani</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">troops</ENAMEX> were discovered to have infiltrated into an especially mountainous area of
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kashmir</ENAMEX>. A limited war began between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>, euphemistically called the
                "Kargil crisis," as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> tried to drive the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pakistani</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> out. Patience with
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> was wearing thin, inside both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSC</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce</ENAMEX>
                Riedel, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSC</ENAMEX> staff <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> responsible for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>, wrote <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Islamabad</ENAMEX>
                was "behaving as a rogue <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> areas-backing Taliban/UBL terror and provoking
                war with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>."
            
            Discussion within the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> then concentrated on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
                main alternatives. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, championed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Riedel</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Assistant Secretary of State</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karl Inderfurth</ENAMEX>, was to undertake a major diplomatic effort to end the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Afghan</ENAMEX> civil
                war and install a national unity <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>, favored by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sheehan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX>,
                and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>, called for labeling the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX> a terrorist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> and ultimately
                funneling secret aid to its chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foe</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern Alliance</ENAMEX>. This dispute would go
                back and forth throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX> and ultimately become entangled with debate about
                enlisting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern Alliance</ENAMEX> as an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ally</ENAMEX> for covert action.
            
            Another diplomatic option may have been available: nurturing <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Afghan</ENAMEX> exile <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> as a
                possible moderate governing alternative to theTaliban. In late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>
                provided some support for talks among the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> of exile <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Afghan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, including
                the ousted <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">King</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zahir Shah</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hamid Karzai</ENAMEX>, about bolstering
                anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Taliban</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> inside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> and linking the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RESPONSES TO AL QAEDA</ENAMEX>'S
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INITIAL ASSAULTS 125 Northern Alliance</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pashtun</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diplomat</ENAMEX> later
                told us that the exile <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> were not ready to move forward and that coordinating
                fractious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> residing in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bonn</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cyprus</ENAMEX> proved extremely difficult.
            
            Frustrated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX>'s resistance, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>
                suggested asking the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saudis</ENAMEX> to offer the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$250 million</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Clarke</ENAMEX>
                opposed having the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> facilitate a "huge grant to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX> as heinous as
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX>" and suggested that the idea might not seem attractive to either
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albright</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton</ENAMEX>-both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> of the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX>'s record on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>'s rights.
            
            The proposal seems to have quietly died.
            Within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX>, some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> delayed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sheehan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX>'s push either
                to designateTaliban-controlled <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> as a state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sponsor</ENAMEX> of terrorism or to
                designate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX> as a foreign terrorist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> (thereby avoiding the issue
                of whether to recognize the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sheehan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX>
                prevailed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 1999</TIMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> issued an executive order effectively
                declaring the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taliban</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX> a state <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sponsor</ENAMEX> of terrorism.
            
            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UN Security Council</ENAMEX> Resolution championed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> added
                economic and travel sanctions.
            
            With <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UN</ENAMEX> sanctions set to come into effect in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> wrote <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX> that "the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX> appear to be up to something." <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Mullah</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Omar</ENAMEX> had
                shuffled his "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cabinet</ENAMEX>" and hinted at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>'s possible departure. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX>'s staff
                thought his most likely destination would be <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Somalia</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chechnya</ENAMEX> seemed less appealing
                with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> on the offensive. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> commented that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Libya</ENAMEX> had previously
                discussed hosting <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>, though he and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> had their doubts that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>
                would trust secular <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dictators</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein or Muammar Qadhafi</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Clarke</ENAMEX>
                also raised the "remote possibility" of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX>, which offered vast uncontrolled
                spaces. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSG</ENAMEX> discussed whether the sanctions had rattled the
                Taliban, who seemed "to be looking for a face-saving way out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>
                    issue."
            
            In fact none of the outside pressure had any visible effect on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mullah Omar</ENAMEX>, who was
                unconcerned about commerce with the outside world. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Omar</ENAMEX> had virtually no diplomatic
                contact with the West, since he refused to meet with non- <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslims</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>
                learned that at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of 1999</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">theTaliban Council</ENAMEX> of Ministers unanimously
                reaffirmed that their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX> would stick by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>. Relations between <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>
                and theTaliban <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> were sometimes tense, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">foundation</ENAMEX> was deep and
                    personal.
            
            Indeed, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mullah Omar</ENAMEX> had executed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subordinate</ENAMEX> who opposed his pro-Bin
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ladin</ENAMEX> policy.
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> would try tougher sanctions in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>. Working with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> (a country
                involved in an ongoing campaign against <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chechen</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">separatists</ENAMEX>, some of whom received
                support from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>), the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> persuaded the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Nations</ENAMEX> to adopt
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Security Council</ENAMEX> Resolution <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1333</TIMEX>, which included an embargo on arms shipments to the
                Taliban, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 2000</TIMEX>.
            
            The aim of the resolution was to hit the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taliban</ENAMEX> where it was most sensitive- on the
                battlefield against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern Alliance</ENAMEX>-and criminalize giving them <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX> and
                providing military "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisers</ENAMEX>," which <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> had been doing.
            
            Yet the passage of the resolution had no visible effect on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Omar</ENAMEX>, nor did it halt the
                flow of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pakistani</ENAMEX> military assistance to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX>.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> had continued to try to get cooperation from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> in pressing
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX> to stop sheltering <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> contacted <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sharif</ENAMEX> again
                in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 1999</TIMEX>, partly to discuss the crisis with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> but also to urge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sharif</ENAMEX>, "in
                the strongest way I can," to persuade the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX> to expel <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>.
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> suggested that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> use its control over oil supplies to the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX> and over <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Afghan</ENAMEX> imports through <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Karachi</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sharif</ENAMEX> suggested instead that
                <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pakistani</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> might try to capture <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> themselves. Though no one in
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> thought this was likely to happen, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> gave the idea his
                    blessing.
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> met with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sharif</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early July</TIMEX>. Though the meeting's main
                purpose was to seal the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pakistani</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prime minister</ENAMEX>'s decision to withdraw from the
                Kargil confrontation in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kashmir</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> complained about <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>'s
                failure to take effective action with respect to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Sharif</ENAMEX>
                came back to his earlier proposal and won approval for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> assistance in training a
                Pakistani special <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces team</ENAMEX> for an operation against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>. Then, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX>
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sharif</ENAMEX> was deposed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Pervez Musharraf</ENAMEX>, and the plan was
                    terminated.
            
            At first, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> hoped that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Musharraf</ENAMEX> 's coup might create an
                opening for action on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>. A career military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Musharraf</ENAMEX> was thought to
                have the political strength to confront and influence the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pakistani</ENAMEX> military
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intelligence</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">service</ENAMEX>, which supported the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX> speculated that the new
                government might use <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> to buy concessions from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>, but neither side
                ever developed such an initiative.
            
            By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late 1999</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than a year</TIMEX> after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">embassy</ENAMEX> bombings, diplomacy with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>,
                like the efforts with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX>, had, according to Under <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary of State</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pickering</ENAMEX>, "borne little <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX>."
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COVERT ACTION</ENAMEX>
            As part of the response to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">embassy</ENAMEX> bombings, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> signed a
                Memorandum of Notification authorizing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> to let its tribal assets use force to
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">capture Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">associates</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> told the tribals that the plan to
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">capture Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>, which had been "turned off " <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three months earlier</TIMEX>, was back on.
                The memorandum also authorized the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> to attack <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> in other ways. Also, an
                executive order froze financial holdings that could be linked to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>.
            
            The counterterrorism <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> thought it was gaining a better understanding of
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX>. In preparation for briefing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate RESPONSES TO AL</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QAEDA</ENAMEX>'S <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INITIAL ASSAULTS 127 Select Committee on Intelligence</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 2</TIMEX>, Tenet
                was told that the intelligence <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> knew more about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX>"than
                about any other top tier terrorist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>."
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> was using this knowledge to disrupt a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>-associated cells.
                Working with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Albanian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX> had raided an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> forgery
                operation and another terrorist <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tirana</ENAMEX>. These <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> may have disrupted
                a planned attack on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">embassy</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tirana</ENAMEX>, and did lead to the rendition of a
                number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>-related <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorist operatives</ENAMEX>. After the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">embassy</ENAMEX> bombings, there
                were arrests in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Azerbaijan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX>. Several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX> were sent to an
                <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> described working with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX> to prevent a planned
                attack on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">embassy</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Uganda</ENAMEX>, and a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">suspects</ENAMEX> were arrested. On
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 16</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abu Hajer</ENAMEX>, one of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">deputies</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sudan</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of his
                computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX> procurement, was arrested in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>. He was the
                most important <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> lieutenant captured thus far. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> commented to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Berger</ENAMEX>
                with satisfaction that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September</TIMEX> had brought the "greatest number of
                terrorist arrests in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a short period of time</TIMEX> that we have ever
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">arranged/facilitated</ENAMEX>."
            
            Given the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">August Memorandum of Notification</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> had already been
                working on new plans for using the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Afghan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tribals</ENAMEX> to capture <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>. During
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tribals</ENAMEX> claimed to have tried <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least four</NUMEX> times to
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ambush Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>. Senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> doubted whether any of these ambush attempts
                had actually occurred. But the tribals did seem to have success in reporting where
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> was.
            
            This information was more useful than it had been in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past</TIMEX>; since the August
                missile strikes, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> had taken to moving his sleeping place frequently and
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unpredictably</ENAMEX> and had added new bodyguards. Worst of all, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>'s senior
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> had stopped using a particular means of communication almost immediately
                after a leak to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Times</ENAMEX>.
            
            This made it much more difficult for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Security Agency</ENAMEX> to intercept his
                conversations. But since the tribals seemed to know where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> was or would be,
                an alternative to capturing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> would be to mark his location and call in
                another round of missile strikes.
            On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November 3</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Small Group</ENAMEX> met to discuss these problems, among other topics.
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Preparing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tenet</ENAMEX> for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Small Group</ENAMEX> meeting in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid- November</TIMEX>, the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Counterterrorist Center</ENAMEX> stressed, "At this point we cannot predict when or if a
                capture operation will be executed by our assets."
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> counterterrorism <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> also worried about possible domestic attacks. Several
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intelligence</ENAMEX> reports, some of dubious sourcing, mentioned <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> as a possible
                target. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 26</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSG</ENAMEX> took the unusual step of holding a meeting
                dedicated to trying "to evaluate the threat of a terrorist attack in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Usama bin Ladin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX>."107The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSG</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> were "urged to be as
                creative as possible in their thinking" about preventing a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> attack on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
                territory. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Participants</ENAMEX> noted that while the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> had been given additional resources
                for such efforts, both it and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> were having problems exploiting leads by
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">tracing U.S.</ENAMEX> telephone numbers and translating documents obtained in cell
                disruptions abroad. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX> reported that the current guidelines from
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Attorney General</ENAMEX> gave sufficient legal authority for domestic investigation and
                    surveillance.
            
            Though intelligence gave no clear indication of what might be afoot, some
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intelligence</ENAMEX> reports mentioned chemical <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX>, pointing toward work at a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camp</ENAMEX> in
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">southern Afghanistan</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Derunta</ENAMEX>. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November 4, 1998</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Attorney</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office</ENAMEX>
                for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southern District of New York</ENAMEX> unsealed its indictment of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>, charging
                him with conspiracy to attack <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> defense installations. The indictment also
                charged that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> had allied itself with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sudan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hezbollah</ENAMEX>. The
                original sealed indictment had added that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> had "reached an understanding
                with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> would not work against that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> and
                that on particular projects, specifically including weapons development, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>
                would work cooperatively with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Government</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX>."
                This passage led <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX>, who for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> had read intelligence reports on
                <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Iraqi</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Sudanese</ENAMEX> cooperation on chemical <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX>, to speculate to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX> that a large
                <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Iraqi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">presence</ENAMEX> at chemical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Khartoum</ENAMEX> was "probably a direct result of
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq-Al Qida</ENAMEX> agreement." <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> added that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VX</ENAMEX> precursor traces found near <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">al</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shifa</ENAMEX> were the "exact formula used by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX>."110This language about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>'s
                "understanding" with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> had been dropped, however, when a superseding indictment
                was filed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November 1998</TIMEX>.
            
            On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 4, 1998</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> included an article in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Presidential Daily</ENAMEX>
                Brief describing intelligence, received from a friendly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX>, about a
                threatened hijacking in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. This article was declassified at our
                request.
            
                The following is the text of an item from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Presidential Daily Brief</ENAMEX> received

                    <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterparts</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> soon thereafter to discuss options-perhaps including an

                    <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late last month</TIMEX> told a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleague</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kandahar</ENAMEX> that he had shipped a group of
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">containers</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">associates</ENAMEX> also talked about the movement
                    of containers to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> before the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Africa</ENAMEX> bombings.

                        the "<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">ninth</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">month</TIMEX> [of pregnancy]." 
                    An alleged <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supporter</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late last month</TIMEX> remarked to his
                        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> that he planned to work in "commerce" from abroad and said his
                        impending "marriage," which would take place soon, would be a
                        "surprise.""<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commerce</ENAMEX>" and "marriage" often are codewords for terrorist
                        attacks.
                
            
             The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">same day</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> convened a meeting of his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSG</ENAMEX> to discuss both the hijacking
                concern and the antiaircraft missile threat. To address the hijacking warning, the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> agreed that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airports</ENAMEX> should go to maximum security starting that
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekend</TIMEX>. They agreed to boost security at other <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East coast</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airports</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> agreed
                to distribute versions of the report to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> to pass to the New York
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Police</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">airlines</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> issued a security directive on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December</TIMEX>
                <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>, with specific requirements for more intensive air <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carrier</ENAMEX> screening of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX>
                and more oversight of the screening process, at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York City</ENAMEX> area
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airports</ENAMEX>.
            
            The intelligence <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> could learn little about the source of the information.
                Later in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December</TIMEX> and again in early <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 1999</TIMEX>, more information arrived from the
                same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX>, reporting that the planned hijacking had been stalled because <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX>, who were sketchily described, had been arrested near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>,
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">D.C.</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>. After investigation, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> could find no information to support
                the hijack threat; nor could it verify any arrests like those described in the
                report. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> alert at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> area <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airports</ENAMEX> ended on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 31, 1999</TIMEX>.
            
            On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 17, the day</TIMEX> after the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> began their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Desert Fox</ENAMEX>
                bombing campaign against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Small Group</ENAMEX> convened to discuss intelligence
                suggesting imminent <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> attacks on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">embassies</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Qatar</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ethiopia</ENAMEX>.
                The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next day</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tenet</ENAMEX> sent a memo to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cabinet</ENAMEX>, and senior
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> describing reports that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> planned to
                attack <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> targets very soon, possibly over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next few days</TIMEX>, before <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ramadan</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">celebrations</ENAMEX> began. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tenet</ENAMEX> said he was "greatly concerned."
            
            With alarms sounding, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Small Group</ENAMEX> considered ideas about how to
                respond to or prevent such attacks. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Generals Shelton</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zinni</ENAMEX> came up with military
                options. Special <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Operations Forces</ENAMEX> were later told that they might be ordered to
                attempt very high-risk in-and-out raids either in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Khartoum</ENAMEX>, to capture a senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bin</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ladin</ENAMEX> operative known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abu Hafs</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mauritanian</ENAMEX>- who appeared to be engineering
                some of the plots-or in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kandahar</ENAMEX>, to capture <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> himself. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shelton</ENAMEX> told us that
                such <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> are not risk free, invoking the memory of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX> "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Black Hawk</ENAMEX> down"
                fiasco in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mogadishu</ENAMEX>.
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> reported on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 18</TIMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> might be traveling to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kandahar</ENAMEX> and
                could be targeted there with cruise <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missiles</ENAMEX>. Vessels with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tomahawk</ENAMEX> cruise <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missiles</ENAMEX>
                were on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">station</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Arabian Sea</ENAMEX>, and could fire within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a few hours</TIMEX> of receiving
                target data.
            
            On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 20</TIMEX>, intelligence indicated <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> would be spending <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the night</TIMEX> at the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Haji Habash</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX>, part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">governor</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kandahar</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> of the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX>, "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike</ENAMEX>," told us that he promptly briefed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tenet</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">deputy</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">John</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gordon</ENAMEX>. From the field, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gary Schroen</ENAMEX> advised:"Hit him tonight-we may not
                get another chance." An urgent teleconference of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principals</ENAMEX> was arranged.
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principals</ENAMEX> considered a cruise <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missile</ENAMEX> strike to try to kill <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> issue
                they discussed was the potential collateral damage-the number of innocent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bystanders</ENAMEX>
                who would be killed or wounded. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Zinni</ENAMEX> predicted a number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">well over 200</NUMEX> and
                was concerned about damage to a nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX>. The senior intelligence <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> on
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joint Staff</ENAMEX> apparently made a different calculation, estimating <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> as much
                collateral damage and not predicting damage to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX>. By the end of the
                meeting, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principals</ENAMEX> decided against recommending to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> that he order
                a strike. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A few weeks later</TIMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 1999</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> wrote that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principals</ENAMEX> had
                thought the intelligence <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only half</NUMEX> reliable and had worried about killing or
                injuring perhaps <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tenet</ENAMEX> said he remembered doubts about the reliability
                of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> and concern about hitting the nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX>." <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike</ENAMEX>" remembered Tenet
                telling him that the military was concerned that <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a few hours</TIMEX> had passed since the
                last sighting of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> and that this persuaded everyone that the chance of
                failure was too great.
            
            Some lower-level <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> were angry." <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike</ENAMEX>" reported to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schroen</ENAMEX> that he had been
                unable to sleep after this decision. "I'm sure we'll regret not acting <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">last night</TIMEX>,"
                he wrote, criticizing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principals</ENAMEX> for "worrying that some stray shrapnel might
                hit the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Habash</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX> and 'offend' <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslims</ENAMEX>." He commented that they had not shown
                comparable sensitivity when deciding to bomb <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslims</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principals</ENAMEX>, he
                said, were "obsessed" with trying to get others- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saudis, Pakistanis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Afghan</ENAMEX>
                tribals-to "do what we won't do." Schroen was disappointed too." We should have done
                it last night," he wrote." We may well come to regret the decision not to go
                    ahead." The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joint Staff</ENAMEX> 's deputy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> for
                operations agreed, even though he told us that later intelligence appeared to show
                that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> had left his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">quarters</ENAMEX> before the strike would have occurred. Missing
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>, he said, "would have caused us a hell of a problem, but it was a shot we
                should have taken, and we would have had to pay the price."
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principals</ENAMEX> began considering other, more aggressive covert alternatives using the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tribals</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> suggested that the tribals would prefer to try a raid rather
                than a roadside <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ambush</ENAMEX> because they would have better control, it would be less
                dangerous, and it played more to their skills and experience. But everyone knew that
                if the tribals were to conduct such a raid, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">guns</ENAMEX> would be blazing. The current
                Memorandum of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Notification</ENAMEX> instructed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> to capture <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> and to use lethal
                force only in self-defense. Work now began on a new memorandum that would give the
                tribals more latitude. The intention was to say that they could use lethal force if
                the attempted capture seemed impossible to complete successfully.
            
            Early drafts of this highly sensitive document emphasized that it authorized only a
                capture operation. The tribals were to be paid only if they captured <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>, not
                if they killed him. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Officials</ENAMEX> throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> approved this draft. But on
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 21, the day</TIMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principals</ENAMEX> decided not to launch the cruise <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missile</ENAMEX>
                strike against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kandahar</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> urged strengthening the language to allow
                the tribals to be paid whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> was captured or killed. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX> and Tenet
                then worked together to take this line of thought even further.
            
            They finally agreed, as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Berger</ENAMEX> reported to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>, that an extraordinary
                step was necessary. The new memorandum would allow the killing of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> if the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> and the tribals judged that capture was not feasible (a judgment it already
                seemed clear they had reached). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyer</ENAMEX> who worked on the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">draft</ENAMEX> told us that what was envisioned was a group of tribals assaulting a location,
                leading to a shoot-out. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> and others would be captured if possible, but
                probably would be killed. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>'s position was that under the law of
                armed conflict, killing a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> who posed an imminent threat to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>
                would be an act of self-defense, not an assassination. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas Eve 1998</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Berger</ENAMEX>
                sent a final draft to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>, with an explanatory memo. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">President</ENAMEX>
                approved the document.
            
            Because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> considered this operation highly sensitive, only a tiny
                number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> knew about this <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Memorandum of Notification</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX> arranged for the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSC</ENAMEX>'s legal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adviser</ENAMEX> to inform <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albright</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cohen</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shelton</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Reno</ENAMEX>. None was allowed
                to keep a copy. Congressional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> were briefed, as required by law. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Attorney</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reno</ENAMEX> had sent a letter to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> expressing her <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX>: she warned
                of possible retaliation, including the targeting of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>. She did not pose
                any legal objection. A copy of the final document, along with the carefully crafted
                instructions that were to be sent to the tribals, was given to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tenet</ENAMEX>.
            
            A message from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tenet</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> field <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> directed them to communicate to the tribals
                the instructions authorized by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX>: the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX> preferred that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bin</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ladin</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lieutenants</ENAMEX> be captured, but if a successful capture operation was not
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">feasible</ENAMEX>, the tribals were permitted to kill them. The instructions added that the
                tribals must avoid killing others unnecessarily and must not kill or abuse <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>
                or his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lieutenants</ENAMEX> if they surrendered. Finally, the tribals would not be paid if
                this set of requirements was not met.
            
            The field <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> passed these instructions to the tribals word for word. But he
                prefaced the directions with a message:"From the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> down to the
                average <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">street</ENAMEX>, we want him [<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>] stopped." If the tribals captured
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> assured them that he would receive a fair trial under <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
                law and be treated humanely. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> reported that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tribals</ENAMEX> said they
                "fully understand the contents, implications and the spirit of the message" and that
                that their response was,"We will try our best to capture <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> alive and will
                have no intention of killing or harming him on purpose." The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tribals</ENAMEX> explained that
                they wanted to prove that their standards of behavior were more civilized than those
                of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">band</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX>. In an additional note addressed to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schroen</ENAMEX>,
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tribals</ENAMEX> noted that if they were to adopt <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>'s ethics,"we would have
                finished the job long before," RESPONSES TO <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AL QAEDA</ENAMEX>'S <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">INITIAL ASSAULTS 133</ENAMEX> but they
                had been limited by their abilities and "by our beliefs and laws we have to
                    respect."
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schroen</ENAMEX> and "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike</ENAMEX>" were impressed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tribals</ENAMEX>' reaction. Schroen cabled that the
                tribals were not in it for the money but as an investment in the future of
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>. "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike"</ENAMEX> agreed that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tribals</ENAMEX>' reluctance to kill was not a
                "showstopper." "From our view," he wrote, "that seems in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> and fair
                    enough."
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Policymakers</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>, including the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> and his national
                security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advisor</ENAMEX>, told us that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX>'s intent regarding covert action
                against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> was clear: he wanted him dead. This intent was never well
                communicated or understood within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tenet</ENAMEX> told the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> that except in
                <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> specific case (discussed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later</TIMEX>), the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> was authorized to kill <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> only
                in the context of a capture operation. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operators</ENAMEX>, and lawyers
                confirmed this understanding." We always talked about how much easier it would have
                been to kill him," a former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> said.
            
            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February 1999</TIMEX>, another draft Memorandum of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Notification</ENAMEX> went to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>.
                It asked him to allow the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> to give exactly the same guidance to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alliance</ENAMEX> as had just been given to the tribals: they could kill <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> if a
                successful capture operation was not feasible. On this occasion, however, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">President</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> crossed out key language he had approved in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December</TIMEX> and inserted more
                ambiguous language. No one we interviewed could shed light on why the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> did
                this. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> told the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> that he had no recollection of why he
                rewrote the language.
            
            Later in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>, when legal authority was needed for enlisting still other
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">collaborators</ENAMEX> and for covering a wider set of contingencies, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lawyers</ENAMEX> returned to
                the language used in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 1998</TIMEX>, which authorized <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> only in the context of a
                capture operation. Given the closely held <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> of the document approved in
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 1998</TIMEX>, and the subsequent return to the earlier language, it is possible to
                understand how the former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> might disagree
                as to whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> was ever authorized by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> to kill <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>.
            
            The dispute turned out to be somewhat academic, as the limits of available legal
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">authority</ENAMEX> were not tested. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> commented to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX> that "despite 'expanded'
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">authority</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> to engage in direct action, they have shown no
                inclination to do so." He added that it was his impression that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> thought the
                tribals unlikely to act against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> and hence relying on them was
                    "unrealistic." Events seemed to bear him out, since
                the tribals did not stage an attack on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> or his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">associates</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>. The
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tribals</ENAMEX> remained active <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">collectors</ENAMEX> of intelligence, however, providing good but not
                predictive information about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>'s whereabouts. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> also tried to improve
                its intelligence reporting on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> by what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tenet</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assistant director</ENAMEX> for
                collection, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">indefatigable</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Allen</ENAMEX>, called an "allout, all-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>,
                <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX>-days-<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a-week</TIMEX>" effort.
            
            The effort might have had an effect. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 12, 1999</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> wrote <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX> that
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>'s confidence in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tribals</ENAMEX>' reporting had increased. It was now higher than
                it had been on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 20</TIMEX>.
            
            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February 1999</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allen</ENAMEX> proposed flying a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U-2</ENAMEX> mission over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> to build a
                baseline of intelligence outside the areas where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tribals</ENAMEX> had coverage. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Clarke</ENAMEX>
                was nervous about such a mission because he continued to fear that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> might
                leave for someplace less accessible. He wrote Deputy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Security Advisor</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Kerrick</ENAMEX> that one reliable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">source</ENAMEX> reported <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>'s having met with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iraqi</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>, who "may have offered him asylum." Other intelligence <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> said that
                some <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Taliban</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX>, though not <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mullah Omar</ENAMEX>, had urged <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> to go to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX>. If
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> actually moved to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX>, wrote <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX>, his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> would be at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Saddam</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hussein</ENAMEX>'s service, and it would be "virtually impossible" to find him. Better to get
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> declared.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX> suggested sending <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U-2</ENAMEX> flight, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> opposed even this. It would
                require <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pakistani</ENAMEX> approval, he wrote; and "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pak</ENAMEX>[<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">istan</ENAMEX>'s] intel[<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ligence service</ENAMEX>] is in
                bed with" <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> and would warn him that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> was getting ready for
                a bombing campaign: "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Armed</ENAMEX> with that knowledge, old wily <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Usama</ENAMEX> will likely boogie to
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baghdad</ENAMEX>."135Though told also by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce Riedel</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">wanted Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baghdad</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX> conditionally authorized a single <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U-2</ENAMEX> flight.
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allen</ENAMEX> meanwhile had found other ways of getting the information he wanted. So the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U-2</ENAMEX> flight never occurred.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEARCHING FOR FRESH OPTIONS</ENAMEX>
            "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Boots on the Ground?</ENAMEX>"
            Starting on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day the August 1998</TIMEX> strikes were launched, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Shelton</ENAMEX> had issued
                a planning order to prepare follow-on strikes and think beyond just using cruise
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missiles</ENAMEX>.
            
            The initial strikes had been called <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Operation Infinite Reach</ENAMEX>. The follow-on plans
                were given the code name <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Operation Infinite Resolve</ENAMEX>.
            At the time, any actual military action in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> would have been carried out by
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Zinni</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central Command</ENAMEX>. This command was therefore the locus for most
                military planning. Zinni was even less enthusiastic than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cohen</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shelton</ENAMEX> about
                follow-on cruise <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missile</ENAMEX> strikes. He knew that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tomahawks</ENAMEX> did not always hit
                their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX>. After the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 20</TIMEX> strikes, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> had had to call
                <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pakistani</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Prime Minister</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sharif</ENAMEX> to apologize for a wayward <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missile</ENAMEX> that had killed
                several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> in a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pakistani</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">village</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sharif</ENAMEX> had been understanding, while
                commenting on <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> "overkill."
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Zinni</ENAMEX> feared that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> would in the future locate himself in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missiles</ENAMEX> could kill <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Afghans</ENAMEX>. He worried also lest <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pakistani</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX>
                not get adequate warning, think the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missiles</ENAMEX> came from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RESPONSES TO AL</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QAEDA</ENAMEX>'S <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">INITIAL ASSAULTS 135</ENAMEX> and do something that everyone would later regret.
                Discussing potential repercussions in the region of his military responsibility,
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zinni</ENAMEX> said, "It was easy to take the shot from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> and walk away from it. We
                had to live there."
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zinni</ENAMEX>'s distinct preference would have been to build up counterterrorism capabilities
                in neighboring <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Uzbekistan</ENAMEX>. But he told us that he could not drum
                up much interest in or money for such a purpose from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>, partly, he thought,
                because these <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> had dictatorial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX>.
            
            After the decision-in which fear of collateral damage was an important factor- not to
                use cruise <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missiles</ENAMEX> against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kandahar</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 1998</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shelton</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> in the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> developed plans for using an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AC-130</ENAMEX> gunship instead of cruise <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missile</ENAMEX>
                strikes. Designed specifically for the special <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX>, the version of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AC-130</ENAMEX>
                known as "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Spooky</ENAMEX>"can fly in fast or from high altitude, undetected by radar; guided
                to its <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">zone</ENAMEX> by extraordinarily complex electronics, it is capable of rapidly firing
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">precision-</ENAMEX>guided <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25, 40</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">105</NUMEX> mm projectiles. Because this system could target
                more precisely than a salvo of cruise <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missiles</ENAMEX>, it had a much lower risk of causing
                collateral damage. After giving <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> a briefing and being encouraged to proceed,
                Shelton formally directed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zinni</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">General</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Schoomaker</ENAMEX>, who headed the Special
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Operations Command</ENAMEX>, to develop plans for an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AC-130</ENAMEX> mission against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>'s
                <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX> and infrastructure in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joint Staff</ENAMEX> prepared a decision
                paper for deployment of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Special Operations</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>.
            
            Though <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> continued to indicate interest in this option, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AC-</ENAMEX>130s
                were never deployed. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> wrote at the time that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zinni</ENAMEX> opposed their use, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">John</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maher</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joint Staff</ENAMEX> 's deputy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of operations, agreed that this was
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zinni</ENAMEX>'s position. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zinni</ENAMEX> himself does not recall blocking the option. He told us that
                he understood the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Special Operations Command</ENAMEX> had never thought the intelligence good
                enough to justify actually moving <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AC-130s</ENAMEX> into position. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schoomaker</ENAMEX> says, on the
                contrary, that he thought the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AC-130</ENAMEX> option feasible.
            
            The most likely explanation for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generals</ENAMEX>' differing recollections is that
                both of them thought serious preparation for any such operations would require a
                long-term redeployment of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Special Operations</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Middle East</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AC-130s</ENAMEX> would need <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX> because the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>'s unrefueled range was only
                a little <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">over 2,000 miles</NUMEX>. They needed search-and-rescue backup, which would have
                still less range. Thus an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AC-130</ENAMEX> deployment had to be embedded in a wider political
                and military concept involving <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> or other neighboring <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> to address
                issues relating to basing and overflight. No one ever put such an initiative on the
                table. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zinni</ENAMEX> therefore cautioned about simply ordering up <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AC-130</ENAMEX> deployments for a
                quick strike; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schoomaker</ENAMEX> planned for what he saw as a practical strike option; and
                the underlying issues were not fully engaged. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joint Staff</ENAMEX> decision paper was
                never turned into an interagency policy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>.
            The same was true for the option of using <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ground units</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Special Operations</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Command</ENAMEX>. Within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">command</ENAMEX>, some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX>-such as Schoomaker-wanted the mission of
                "putting boots on the ground" to get at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>. At the time, Special
                Operations was designated as a "supporting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">command</ENAMEX>," not a "supported command": that
                is, it supported a theater <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commander</ENAMEX> and did not prepare its own plans for dealing
                with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schoomaker</ENAMEX> proposed to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shelton</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cohen</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Special Operations</ENAMEX>
                become a supported command, but the proposal was not adopted. Had it been accepted,
                he says, he would have taken on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> mission instead of deferring to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zinni</ENAMEX>.
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Lieutenant General</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Boykin</ENAMEX>, the current <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">deputy</ENAMEX> under <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">secretary</ENAMEX> of defense for
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intelligence</ENAMEX> and a founding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta Force</ENAMEX>, told us that "opportunities were
                missed because of an unwillingness to take risks and a lack of vision and
                    understanding."
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> relied on the advice of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Shelton</ENAMEX>, who informed him that
                without intelligence on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>'s location, a commando raid's chance of failure
                was high. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shelton</ENAMEX> told <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> he would go forward with "boots on the
                ground" if the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> ordered him to do so; however, he had to ensure that the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> was completely aware of the large logistical problems inherent in a
                military <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX>.
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Special Operations</ENAMEX> plans were apparently conceived as another quick strike
                option-an option to insert <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> after the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> received actionable
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intelligence</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> told the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> that "if we had had really good
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intelligence</ENAMEX> about . . . where [<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Usama Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>] was, I would have done it." Zinni
                and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schoomaker</ENAMEX> did make preparations for possible very high risk in-and-out
                operations to capture or kill <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cohen</ENAMEX> told the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> that the notion
                of putting military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> on the ground without some reasonable certitude that
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> was in a particular location would have resulted in the mission's failure
                and the loss of life in a fruitless effort.
            
            None of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> was aware of the ambitious plan developed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months earlier</TIMEX> by
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lower-level Defense</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>.
            In our interviews, some military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> repeatedly invoked the analogy of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Desert</ENAMEX>
                <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> and the failed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1980</TIMEX> hostage rescue mission in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX>.
            
            They were dubious about a quick strike approach to using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Special Operations Forces</ENAMEX>,
                which they thought complicated and risky. Such efforts would have required bases in
                the region, but all the options were unappealing. Pro-Taliban elements of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>'s
                military might warn <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> or his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">associates</ENAMEX> of pending <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX>. With nearby
                basing options limited, an alternative was to fly from <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Arabian Sea</ENAMEX> or
                from land bases in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Persian Gulf</ENAMEX>, as was done after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9/11</TIMEX>. Such operations would
                then have to be supported from long distances, overflying the airspace of nations
                that might not have been supportive or aware of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> efforts.
            
            However, if these hurdles were addressed, and if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">military</ENAMEX> could then operate
                regularly in the region for a long period, perhaps clandestinely, it might RESPONSES
                TO <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AL QAEDA</ENAMEX>'S <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">INITIAL ASSAULTS 137</ENAMEX> attempt to gather intelligence and wait for an
                opportunity. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Special Operations</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commander</ENAMEX> said his view of actionable
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intelligence</ENAMEX> was that if you "give me the action, I will give you the
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intelligence</ENAMEX>." But this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">course</ENAMEX> would still be risky,
                in light both of the difficulties already mentioned and of the danger that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
                operations might fail disastrously. We have found no evidence that such a long-term
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">political-military</ENAMEX> approach for using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Special Operations Forces</ENAMEX> in the region was
                proposed to or analyzed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Small Group</ENAMEX>, even though such capability had been
                honed for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least a decade</TIMEX> within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense Department</ENAMEX>. Therefore the debate
                looked to some like bold proposals from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> meeting hypercaution from the
                military. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> saw it this way. Of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">military</ENAMEX>, he said to us,"They were very,
                very, very reluctant." But from another perspective,
                poorly informed proposals for bold action were pitted against experienced
                professional judgment. That was how <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Secretary</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense Cohen</ENAMEX> viewed it. He said to
                us:"I would have to place my judgment call in terms of, do I believe that the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chairman</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joint Chiefs</ENAMEX>, former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commander</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Special Forces</ENAMEX> command, is in a
                better position to make a judgment on the feasibility of this than, perhaps, Mr.
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX>?"
            
            Beyond a large-scale political-military commitment to build up a covert or
                clandestine capability using <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> on the ground, either military or
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>, there was a still larger option that could have been considered-invading
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> itself. Every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> we questioned about the possibility of an
                invasion of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> said that it was almost unthinkable, absent a provocation
                such as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX>, because of poor prospects for cooperation from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> and other
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nations</ENAMEX> and because they believed the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">public</ENAMEX> would not support it. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cruise</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missiles</ENAMEX>
                were and would remain the only military option on the table.
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Desert Camp</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February 1999</TIMEX>
            Early in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> received reporting that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> was spending much of his
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camps</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Afghan</ENAMEX> desert south of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kandahar</ENAMEX>. At the
                beginning of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> was reportedly located in the vicinity of the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sheikh Ali</ENAMEX> camp, a desert hunting <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camp</ENAMEX> being used by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> from a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gulf</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>.
                Public <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> have stated that these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">visitors</ENAMEX> were from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United Arab</ENAMEX>
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Emirates</ENAMEX>.
            
            Reporting from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>'s assets provided a detailed description of the hunting <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camp</ENAMEX>,
                including its size, location, resources, and security, as well as of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>'s
                smaller, adjacent <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camp</ENAMEX>.
            
            Because this was not in an urban area, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missiles</ENAMEX> launched against it would have less
                risk of causing collateral damage. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February 8</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">military</ENAMEX> began to ready itself
                for a possible strike.
            
            The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next day</TIMEX>, national technical intelligence confirmed the location and description
                of the larger <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camp</ENAMEX> and showed the nearby presence of an official <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> of the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United Arab Emirates</ENAMEX>. But the location of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">quarters</ENAMEX> could not be pinned
                down so precisely.
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> did its best to answer a host of questions about the larger <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camp</ENAMEX> and its
                residents and about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> schedule and routines to support military
                contingency planning. According to reporting from the tribals, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> regularly
                went from his adjacent camp to the larger <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camp</ENAMEX> where he visited the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Emiratis</ENAMEX>; the
                tribals expected him to be at the hunting <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camp</ENAMEX> for such a visit at least until
                <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midmorning</TIMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February 11</TIMEX>.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> wrote to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX>'s deputy on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February 10</TIMEX> that the military was then doing
                targeting work to hit the main <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camp</ENAMEX> with cruise <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missiles</ENAMEX> and should be in position
                to strike <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the following</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX>.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Speaker</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">House Dennis Hastert</ENAMEX> appears to have been briefed on the
                    situation.
            
            No strike was launched. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February 12</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> had apparently moved on, and the
                immediate strike plans became moot.
            
            According to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>, policymakers were concerned about the danger
                that a strike would kill an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Emirati</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prince</ENAMEX> or other senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> who might be
                with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> or close by. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> told us the strike was called off after
                consultations with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tenet</ENAMEX> because the intelligence was dubious, and it
                seemed to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> as if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> was presenting an option to attack <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>'s best
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">counterterrorism</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ally</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gulf</ENAMEX>. The lead <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> in the field, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gary Schroen</ENAMEX>,
                felt that the intelligence reporting in this case was very reliable; the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>
                unit <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX>, "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike</ENAMEX>," agreed. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schroen</ENAMEX> believes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> that this was a lost opportunity
                to kill <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> before 9/11.
            
            Even after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>'s departure from the area, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> hoped he might return,
                seeing the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camp</ENAMEX> as a magnet that could draw him for as long as it was still set up.
                The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">military</ENAMEX> maintained readiness for another strike opportunity.
            
            On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 7, 1999</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> called a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAE</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> to express his concerns about possible
                associations between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Emirati</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> later wrote in a
                memorandum of this conversation that the call had been approved at an interagency
                meeting and cleared with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>.
            
            When the former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> unit <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> found out about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX>'s call, he questioned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>, who denied having given such a clearance.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Imagery</ENAMEX> confirmed that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">less than a week</TIMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX>'s phone call the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camp</ENAMEX> was
                hurriedly dismantled, and the site was deserted.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX>, including <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Deputy Director</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Operations Pavitt</ENAMEX>, were irate." <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike</ENAMEX>"
                thought the dismantling of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camp</ENAMEX> erased a possible site for targeting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bin</ENAMEX>
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ladin</ENAMEX>.
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United Arab Emirates</ENAMEX> was becoming both a valued counterterrorism <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ally</ENAMEX> of the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX> and a persistent counterterrorism problem. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">From 1999</TIMEX> through early
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> personally, pressed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAE</ENAMEX>, one of
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX>'s only travel and financial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">outlets</ENAMEX> to the outside world, to break off
                its ties and enforce sanctions, especially those relating to flights to and from
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>.
            
            These efforts achieved little before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9/11</TIMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 1999</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAE</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Minister</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State</ENAMEX> for
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Foreign Affairs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hamdan bin Zayid</ENAMEX> threatened to break relations with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX> over
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>.
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX> did not take him seriously, however. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Zayid</ENAMEX> later told an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diploRESPONSES</ENAMEX> TO <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AL QAEDA</ENAMEX>'S <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">INITIAL ASSAULTS 139</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mat</ENAMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAE</ENAMEX> valued its
                relations with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX> because the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Afghan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">radicals</ENAMEX> offered a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterbalance</ENAMEX> to
                "<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Iranian</ENAMEX> dangers" in the region, but he also noted that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAE</ENAMEX> did not want to
                upset the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>.
            
            Looking for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Partners</ENAMEX>
            Although not all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> had lost faith in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tribals</ENAMEX>' capabilities-many judged
                them to be good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporters</ENAMEX>-few believed they would carry out an ambush of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>.
                The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Counterterrorist Center</ENAMEX> compared relying on the tribals to playing
                the lottery.
            
            He and his associates, supported by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX>, pressed for developing a partnership with
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern Alliance</ENAMEX>, even though doing so might bring the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> squarely
                behind <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> side in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>'s long-running civil war.
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern Alliance</ENAMEX> was dominated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tajiks</ENAMEX> and drew its strength mainly from the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">northern</ENAMEX> and eastern parts of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>. In contrast, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> came
                principally from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>'s most numerous ethnic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pashtuns</ENAMEX>, who are
                concentrated in the southern part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, extending into the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">North</ENAMEX>-West
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Frontier</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baluchistan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">provinces</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>.
            
            Because of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX>'s behavior and its association with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alliance</ENAMEX> had been able at various times to obtain assistance from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX>, and
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">alliance</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> was <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>'s most renowned military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commander</ENAMEX>,
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ahmed Shah Massoud</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reflective</ENAMEX> and charismatic, he had been one of the true <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heroes</ENAMEX>
                of the war against the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviets</ENAMEX>. But his bands had been charged with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX>
                massacre, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern Alliance</ENAMEX> was widely thought to finance itself in part
                through trade in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">heroin</ENAMEX>. Nor had Massoud shown much aptitude for governing except as
                a ruthless <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">warlord</ENAMEX>. Nevertheless, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tenet</ENAMEX> told us <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Massoud</ENAMEX> seemed the most interesting
                possible new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ally</ENAMEX> against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>.
            
            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February 1999</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tenet</ENAMEX> sought <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s authorization to enlist Massoud
                and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partners</ENAMEX>. In response to this request, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> signed the
                Memorandum of Notification whose language he personally altered. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tenet</ENAMEX> says he saw
                no significance in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX>'s changes. So far as he was concerned, it was the
                language of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 1998</TIMEX>, expressing a preference for capture but accepting the
                possibility that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> could not be brought out alive." We were plowing the same
                ground,"<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tenet</ENAMEX> said.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> described <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Massoud</ENAMEX>'s reaction when he heard that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> wanted
                him to capture and not kill <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> characterized <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Massoud</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> language as
                "a wince." <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schroen</ENAMEX> recalled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Massoud</ENAMEX>'s response as "You <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guys</ENAMEX> are crazy-you haven't
                changed a bit." In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Schroen</ENAMEX>'s opinion, the capture proviso inhibited <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Massoud</ENAMEX> and his
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> from going after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> but did not completely stop them.
            
            The idea, however, was a long shot. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>'s usual base of activity was near
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kandahar</ENAMEX>, far from the front lines ofTaliban operations against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alliance</ENAMEX>.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kandahar</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 1999</TIMEX>
            It was in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kandahar</ENAMEX> that perhaps the last, and most likely the best, opportunity arose
                for targeting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> with cruise <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missiles</ENAMEX> before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9/11</TIMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 1999</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> assets in
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> reported on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>'s location in and around <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kandahar</ENAMEX> over the course
                of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five days</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">nights</TIMEX>. The reporting was very detailed and came from several
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>. If this intelligence was not "actionable," working-level <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> said at
                the time and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, it was hard for them to imagine how any intelligence on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bin</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ladin</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> would meet the standard. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Communications</ENAMEX> were good, and the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">cruise</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missiles</ENAMEX> were ready." This was in our strike zone," a senior military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX>
                said. "It was a fat pitch, a home run." He expected the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missiles</ENAMEX> to fly. When the
                decision came back that they should stand down, not shoot, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> said,"we all
                just slumped." He told us he knew of no one at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> who thought
                it was a bad gamble. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> "should have been a dead <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>" that <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>, he
                    said.
            
            Working-level <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> agreed. While there was a conflicting intelligence report
                about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>'s whereabouts, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> discounted it. At the time, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>
                working-level <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> were told by their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">managers</ENAMEX> that the strikes were not
                ordered because the military doubted the intelligence and worried about collateral
                damage. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Replying</ENAMEX> to a frustrated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleague</ENAMEX> in the field, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> unit chief
                wrote:"having a chance to get [<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>] <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">36 hours</TIMEX> and foregoing the
                chance each time has made me a bit angry. . . . [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>]he DCI finds himself alone at the
                table, with the other princip[<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">als</ENAMEX>] basically saying 'we'll go along with your
                decision Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX>,' and implicitly saying that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agency</ENAMEX> will hang alone if the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">attack</ENAMEX> doesn't get <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>." But the military <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX>
                quoted earlier recalled that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> had been willing to act. He told us that
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> informed him and others that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tenet</ENAMEX> assessed the chance of the intelligence
                being accurate as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50-50</NUMEX>. This <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> believed that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tenet</ENAMEX>'s assessment was the key
                to the decision.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tenet</ENAMEX> told us he does not remember any details about this episode, except that the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intelligence</ENAMEX> came from a single uncorroborated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> and that there was a risk of
                collateral damage. The story is further complicated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tenet</ENAMEX>'s absence from the
                critical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principals</ENAMEX> meeting on this strike (he was apparently out of town); his
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">deputy</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Gordon</ENAMEX>, was representing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gordon</ENAMEX> recalled having presented the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intelligence</ENAMEX> in a positive light, with appropriate caveats, but stating that this
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intelligence</ENAMEX> was about as good as it could get.
            
            Berger remembered only that in all such cases, the call had been <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tenet's</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX> felt
                sure that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tenet</ENAMEX> was eager to get <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>. In his view, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tenet</ENAMEX> did his job
                responsibly." <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George</ENAMEX> would call and say,'We just don't have it,'" <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX> said.
            
            The decision not to strike in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 1999</TIMEX> may now seem hard to understand. In fairness,
                we note <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> points: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First</ENAMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 1998</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principals</ENAMEX>' wariness about ordering
                a strike appears to have been vindicated: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> left his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> unexpectedly, and
                if a strike had been ordered he would not have been RESPONSES TO <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AL QAEDA</ENAMEX>'S INITIAL
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ASSAULTS 141</ENAMEX> hit. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> in particular, was in the
                midst of intense scrutiny and criticism in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 1999</TIMEX> because faulty intelligence had
                just led the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> to mistakenly bomb the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Chinese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">embassy</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Belgrade</ENAMEX> during
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX> war against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Serbia</ENAMEX>. This episode may have made <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> more cautious than
                might otherwise have been the case.
            
            From <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 1999</TIMEX> until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 2001</TIMEX>, policymakers did not again actively consider a
                missile strike against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>.
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principals</ENAMEX> did give some further consideration in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX> to more general strikes,
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">reviving Clarke</ENAMEX>'s "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Delenda</ENAMEX>" notion of hitting <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camps</ENAMEX> and infrastructure to disrupt <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qaeda</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first months of 1999</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joint Staff</ENAMEX> had developed
                broader target lists to undertake a "focused campaign" against the infrastructure of
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> and to hit <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Taliban</ENAMEX> government <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> as well. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Shelton</ENAMEX>
                told us that the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Taliban</ENAMEX> targets were "easier" to hit and more substantial.
            
            Part of the context for considering broader strikes in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer of 1999</TIMEX> was renewed
                worry about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>'s ambitions to acquire <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX> of mass destruction. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX> and
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> received a flurry of ominous reports, including more
                information about chemical <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX> training or development at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Derunta</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camp</ENAMEX> and
                possible attempts to amass nuclear material at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Herat</ENAMEX>.
            
            By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late June</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> and other intelligence services had concluded that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> was in
                pre-attack mode, perhaps again involving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abu Hafs the Mauritanian</ENAMEX>. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 25</TIMEX>, at
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX>'s request, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX> convened the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Small Group</ENAMEX> in his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> to discuss the
                alert, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>'s WMD programs, and his location. "Should we pre-empt by attacking
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">UBL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX>?" <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> urged <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX> to ask his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX>.
            
            In his handwritten notes on the meeting paper, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX> jotted down the presence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>
                to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tarnak Farms</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX>, which could mean <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60-65</NUMEX> casualties.
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX> noted the possible "slight impact" on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> and added, "if he responds,
                we're blamed."
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> raised the option of waiting until after a terrorist attack, and then
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">retaliating</ENAMEX>, including possible strikes on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX>. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> observed that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bin</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ladin</ENAMEX> would probably empty his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camps</ENAMEX> after an attack.
            
            The military route seemed to have reached a dead end. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 1999</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke</ENAMEX> urged
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX> to ask the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principals</ENAMEX> to ask themselves:"Why have there been no real options
                lately for direct <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> military action?"185There are no notes recording whether the
                question was discussed or, if it was, how it was answered. Reports of possible
                attacks by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> kept coming in throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>. They included a threat to blow
                up the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">D.C.</ENAMEX> In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CSG</ENAMEX> reviewed a possible
                threat to a flight out of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>.
            
            These warnings came amid dozens of others that flooded in. With military and
                diplomatic options practically exhausted by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer of 1999</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> government
                seemed to be back where it had been in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer of 1998</TIMEX>-relying on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> to find
                some other option. That picture also seemed discouraging. Several disruptions and
                renditions aimed against the broader <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> had succeeded.
            
            But covert action efforts in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> had not been fruitful.
            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-1999</TIMEX>, new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> arrived at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Counterterrorist Center</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>
                unit. The new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CTC</ENAMEX>, replacing "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeff</ENAMEX>," was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cofer Black</ENAMEX>. The new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of
                the section that included the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> was "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard</ENAMEX>." <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Black</ENAMEX>, "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard</ENAMEX>," and
                their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> began working on a new operational strategy for attacking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>;
                their starting point was to get better intelligence, relying more on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>'s own
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> and less on the tribals.
            
            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 1999</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> authorized the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> to work with several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX>
                to capture <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>, and extended the scope of efforts to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>'s principal
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lieutenants</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> reportedly also authorized a covert action under
                carefully limited circumstances which, if successful, would have resulted in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bin</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ladin</ENAMEX>'s death.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Attorney General</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reno</ENAMEX> again expressed concerns on policy grounds. She was worried
                about the danger of retaliation. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> also developed the short-lived effort to
                work with a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pakistani</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> that we discussed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX>, and an initiative to work with
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Uzbekistan</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Uzbeks</ENAMEX> needed basic equipment and training. No action could be
                expected before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 2000</TIMEX>, at the earliest.
            
            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fall 1999</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DCI Tenet</ENAMEX> unveiled the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>'s new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> strategy. It was called,
                simply, "the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Plan</ENAMEX>." The Plan proposed continuing disruption and rendition operations
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">worldwide</ENAMEX>. It announced a program for hiring and training better <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> with
                counterterrorism skills, recruiting more assets, and trying to penetrate <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>'s
                ranks. The Plan aimed to close gaps in technical intelligence collection (signal and
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">imagery</ENAMEX>) as well. In addition, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> would increase contacts with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alliance</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rebels</ENAMEX> fighting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX>.
            
            With a new operational strategy, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> evaluated its capture options. None scored
                high marks. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> had no confidence in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pakistani</ENAMEX> effort. In the event that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bin</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ladin</ENAMEX> traveled to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kandahar</ENAMEX> region in southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>, the tribal network
                there was unlikely to attack a heavily guarded <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>; the Counterterrorist
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center</ENAMEX> rated the chance of success at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 10 percent</NUMEX>. To the northwest, the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Uzbeks</ENAMEX> might be ready for a cross-border sortie in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six months</TIMEX>; their chance of
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">success</ENAMEX> was also rated at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 10 percent</NUMEX>.
            
            In the northeast were <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Massoud's Northern Alliance</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX>-perhaps the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>'s best
                option. In late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX>, a group of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Counterterrorist Center</ENAMEX> flew
                into the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Panjshir Valley</ENAMEX> to meet up with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Massoud</ENAMEX>, a hazardous journey in rickety
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">helicopters</ENAMEX> that would be repeated several times in the future. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Massoud</ENAMEX> appeared
                committed to helping the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> collect intelligence on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>'s
                activities and whereabouts and agreed to try to capture him if the opportunity
                arose. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> was satisfied that its reporting on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> would now
                have a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> source. But it also knew that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Massoud</ENAMEX> would act against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> only
                if his own interests and those of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RESPONSES TO AL QAEDA</ENAMEX>'S <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">INITIAL ASSAULTS 143</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX> intersected. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early December</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> rated this possibility at less
                than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 percent</NUMEX>.
            
            Finally, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> considered the possibility of putting <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> on the ground
                in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> had been discussing this option with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Special Operations</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Command</ENAMEX> and found enthusiasm on the working level but reluctance at higher levels.
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> saw a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95 percent</NUMEX> chance of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Special Operations Command</ENAMEX> forces capturing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>
                if deployed-but less than a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 percent</NUMEX> chance of such a deployment. Sending <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> was to be considered "if the gain clearly outweighs the
                risk"-but at this time no such gains presented themselves to warrant the risk.
            
            As mentioned <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX>, such a protracted deployment of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Special Operations Forces</ENAMEX>
                into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>, perhaps as part of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> joined to a deployment of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>'s own
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX>, would have required a major policy initiative (probably combined with
                efforts to secure the support of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> or two neighboring <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>) to make
                a long-term commitment, establish a durable presence on the ground, and be prepared
                to accept the associated risks and costs. Such a military plan was never developed
                for interagency consideration before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9/11</TIMEX>. As <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX> came to a close, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> had a
                new strategic plan in place for capturing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>, but no option was rated as
                having more than a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 percent</NUMEX> chance of achieving that objective.
