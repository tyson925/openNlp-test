            For simplicity, we have adopted the following citation conventions in these endnotes.
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Dozens</NUMEX> of government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> provided the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> with more
                than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5 million</NUMEX> pages of documents and other materials, including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 1,000</NUMEX>
                <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> of audiotapes. In general, we cite documents and other materials by providing
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entity</ENAMEX> of origin, the type of document (e.g., memo, email, report, or

                hearings is cited as "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Condoleezza Rice</ENAMEX> testimony, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Apr. 8, 2004</TIMEX>." Written statements
                for the record provided by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witnesses</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of our public hearings are cited as

            At the request of intelligence <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">community agencies</ENAMEX> (including the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>), we use the
                <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> name and last initial, only the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> name, or in a few instances an alias or
                <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">title</ENAMEX> when referring to working-level <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> in those <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>. At the request of
                several intelligence <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>, we cite most reports from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> and other
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intelligence</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> generically as "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelligence</ENAMEX> report," followed by a
                description of the subject and date. In a few instances in which we were given
                access to highly sensitive documents or information, we cite generically to
                documents or information provided to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX>.
            Our investigation built on the work of many others, including the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joint Inquiry of</ENAMEX>
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and the House Permanent Select Committee</ENAMEX>

                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joint Inquiry</ENAMEX> is cited as "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joint Inquiry</ENAMEX> testimony of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GeorgeTenet</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Oct. 17, 2002</TIMEX>,"
                indicating "closed hearing" where appropriate. We cite interviews conducted by the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joint Inquiry</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> as "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joint Inquiry</ENAMEX> interview of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cofer Black</ENAMEX>," with the date of
                the interview.
            Another major source for our investigation were the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of interviews conducted
                by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Bureau of Investigation</ENAMEX> during its investigation of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX> attacks,
                which it refers to as "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Penttbom</ENAMEX>." <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> write up their interviews on forms
                called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">302s</ENAMEX>, which we cite as "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> report of investigation, interview of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Smith</ENAMEX>,
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Oct. 4, 2001</TIMEX>," using the date of the interview. We cite interviews conducted by
                other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> name and date of the interview; for example, an interview
                conducted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Justice Office</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Inspector General</ENAMEX> is cited as "DOJ

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. No physical, documentary, or analytical evidence provides a convincing explanation
                of why <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Omari</ENAMEX> drove to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portland</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maine</ENAMEX>, from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX> of
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 10</TIMEX>, only to return to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Logan</ENAMEX> on Flight 5930 on <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</TIMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 11</TIMEX>.
                However, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> reacted negatively when informed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portland</ENAMEX> that he would have to
                check in again in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Touhey</ENAMEX> interview (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 27, 2004</TIMEX>). Whatever their
                reason, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portland Jetport</ENAMEX> was the nearest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX> with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">9/11</ENAMEX> flight
                that would have arrived at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Logan</ENAMEX> in time for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> to transfer to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Airlines</ENAMEX> Flight <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>, which had a scheduled departure time of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">7:45 A.M.</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">See Tom Kinton</ENAMEX>

            Like the other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airports</ENAMEX> used by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 9/11 hijackers</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Newark Liberty International</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Airport and Washington Dulles International Airport</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Logan International</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Airport</ENAMEX> was a "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Category X</ENAMEX>" <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX>: i.e., among the largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> liable to
                highest threat, and generally subject to greater security requirements. See <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>

                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Logan</ENAMEX> was selected for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of the hijackings (as were both <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Airlines</ENAMEX>), we found no evidence that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX> targeted particular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airports</ENAMEX> or
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">airlines</ENAMEX>. Nothing stands out about any of them with respect to the only security
                layer that was relevant to the actual hijackings: checkpoint screening. See <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>
                briefing materials, "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Assessment</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Testing Data</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BOS</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EWR</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IAD</ENAMEX>," <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Oct. 24</TIMEX>,
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>. Despite security problems at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Logan</ENAMEX> (see, e.g., <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fox</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> television
                investigative reports in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 2001</TIMEX>, and an email in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 2001</TIMEX> from a
                former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> special <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> regarding his concerns about lax
                security at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX>), no evidence suggests that such issues entered into the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX>' targeting: they simply booked heavily fueled east-to-west
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcontinental</ENAMEX> flights of the large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> they trained to fly that were
                scheduled to take off at nearly the same time. See <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matt Carroll</ENAMEX>, "Fighting Terror

                B1.
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAPPS</ENAMEX> was an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>-approved automated system run by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">airlines</ENAMEX> that scored each
                passenger's profile to identify those who might pose a threat to civil aviation. The
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX> also chose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> at random to receive additional security scrutiny. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Ten</TIMEX>
                out of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> hijackers (including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> on the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Airlines</ENAMEX> flights)
                were identified via the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAPPS</ENAMEX> system. According to the procedures in place on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9/11</TIMEX>,
                in addition to those flagged by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAPPS</ENAMEX> algorithm, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>'s ticket <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> were
                to mark as "selectees" those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> who did not provide correct responses to the
                required security questions, failed to show proper identification, or met other
                criteria. See <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> report,"<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Carrier Standard Security Program</ENAMEX>,"<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 2001</TIMEX>, pp<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.75</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">76</NUMEX>;

                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16, 2004</TIMEX>). It appears that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> was selected at random. See <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Hickson</ENAMEX> briefing
                (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 8, 2004</TIMEX>).
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. The call was placed from a pay phone in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Terminal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C</ENAMEX> (between the screening
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">checkpoint</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United 175</ENAMEX>'s boarding gate). We presume <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shehhi</ENAMEX> made the call, but we
                cannot be sure. <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Logan International Airport</ENAMEX> site visit (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Aug. 15, 2003</TIMEX>); see also <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. Flight <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> pushed back from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Gate 32</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Terminal B</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">7:40</TIMEX>. See <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AAL</ENAMEX> response to the

                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2002</TIMEX>. Customer service <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gail Jawahir</ENAMEX> recalled that her encounter with
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ghamdis</ENAMEX> occurred at "shortly before <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">7 A.M.</TIMEX>," and when shown photos of the
                hijackers, she indicated that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mohand al Shehri</ENAMEX> resembled one of the two she checked
                in (suggesting they were <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Banihammad</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shehri</ENAMEX>). However, she also recalled that the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> had the same last name and had assigned seats on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">row 9</TIMEX> (i.e., the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ghamdis</ENAMEX>), and
                that account has been adopted here. In either case, she almost certainly was dealing
                with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> set of the Flight 175 hijackers. See <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> reports of investigation,

                been unable to understand and answer the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> standard security questions, the only
                consequence would have been the screening of their carry-on and checked bags for
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">explosives</ENAMEX>. See <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> report,"<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Carrier Standard Security Program</ENAMEX>," <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 2001</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p. 76</ENAMEX>.
