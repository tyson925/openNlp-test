            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TERRORIST ENTREPRENEURS</ENAMEX>
            By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 1999</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> was already a potent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adversary</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. Bin
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ladin</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> of operations, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abu Hafs al Masri</ENAMEX>, also known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mohammed Atef</ENAMEX>,
                occupied undisputed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership positions</ENAMEX> atop <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>'s organizational structure.
                Within this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>'s worldwide terrorist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> relied heavily on
                the ideas and work of enterprising and strongwilled field <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commanders</ENAMEX> who enjoyed
                considerable autonomy. To understand how the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> actually worked and to
                introduce the origins of the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">9/11</NUMEX> plot, we briefly examine <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of these
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subordinate commanders</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Khalid Sheikh Mohammed</ENAMEX> (KSM), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Riduan Isamuddin</ENAMEX> (better known
                as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hambali</ENAMEX>), and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Abd al Rahim al Nashiri</ENAMEX>. We will devote the most attention to
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Khalid</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sheikh</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mohammed</ENAMEX>, the chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> of the "<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX> operation." <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Khalid</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sheikh</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mohammed</ENAMEX> No one exemplifies the model of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorist entrepreneur</ENAMEX> more clearly
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">than Khalid Sheikh Mohammed</ENAMEX>, the principal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">architect</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX> attacks. KSM
                followed a rather tortuous path to his eventual membership in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>.
            
            Highly educated and equally comfortable in a government <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> or a terrorist
                safehouse, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> applied his imagination, technical aptitude, and managerial skills to
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hatching</ENAMEX> and planning an extraordinary array of terrorist schemes. These ideas
                included conventional <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> bombing, political assassination, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> bombing,
                hijacking, reservoir poisoning, and, ultimately, the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missiles</ENAMEX>
                guided by suicide <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX>.
            Like his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nephew</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ramzi Yousef</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three years</TIMEX> KSM's junior), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> grew up in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuwait</ENAMEX> but
                traces his ethnic lineage to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Baluchistan</ENAMEX> region straddling <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>.
                Raised in a religious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> claims to have joined the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Brotherhood</ENAMEX> at
                age <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> and to have become enamored of violent jihad at youth <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">camps</ENAMEX> in the desert. In
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1983</TIMEX>, following his graduation from secondary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> left <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuwait</ENAMEX> to enroll at
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chowan College</ENAMEX>, a small <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Baptist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Murfreesboro</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Carolina</ENAMEX>. After a
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">semester</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chowan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> transferred to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North Carolina Agricultural</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Technical</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State University</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greensboro</ENAMEX>, which he attended with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yousef</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX>, another
                future <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> earned a degree in mechanical engineering in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December</TIMEX>
                    <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX>.
            
            Although he apparently did not attract attention for extreme <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Islamist</ENAMEX> beliefs or
                activities while in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> plunged into the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-Soviet Afghan</ENAMEX> jihad
                soon after graduating from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">college</ENAMEX>. Visiting <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time in early
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</TIMEX>, he traveled to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peshawar</ENAMEX>, where his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zahid</ENAMEX> introduced him to the famous
                <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Afghan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mujahid</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abdul Rasul Sayyaf</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hizbul- Ittihad El-Islami</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Islamic</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Union Party</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sayyaf</ENAMEX> became <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mentor</ENAMEX> and provided KSM with military training at
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sayyaf</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sada</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camp</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> claims he then fought the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviets</ENAMEX> and remained at the front
                for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three months</TIMEX> before being summoned to perform administrative duties for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abdullah</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Azzam</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">KSM</ENAMEX> next took a job working for an electronics <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX> that catered to the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">communications</ENAMEX> needs of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Afghan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, where he learned about drills used to
                excavate caves in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>.
            
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Between 1988 and 1992</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> helped run a nongovernmental <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> (NGO) in
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peshawar</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jalalabad</ENAMEX>; sponsored by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sayyaf</ENAMEX>, it was designed to aid young <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Afghan</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mujahideen</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> spent some time fighting alongside the mujahideen in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bosnia</ENAMEX>
                and supporting that effort with financial donations. After returning briefly to
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>, he moved his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Qatar</ENAMEX> at the suggestion of the former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">minister</ENAMEX> of
                <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Islamic</ENAMEX> affairs of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Qatar</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sheikh Abdallah bin Khalid bin Hamad al Thani</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> took a
                position in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Qatar</ENAMEX> as project <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">engineer</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qatari Ministry of Electricity</ENAMEX> and
                <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Water</ENAMEX>. Although he engaged in extensive international travel during his tenure at
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ministry</ENAMEX>-much of it in furtherance of terrorist activity-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> would hold his
                position there until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 1996</TIMEX>, when he fled to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> to avoid capture by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX>.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> first came to the attention of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> law enforcement as a result of his cameo role
                in the first <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Trade Center</ENAMEX> bombing. According to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX>, he learned of Ramzi
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yousef</ENAMEX> 's intention to launch an attack inside the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991 or 1992</TIMEX>,
                when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yousef</ENAMEX> was receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">explosives</ENAMEX> training in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>. During the fall of
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX>, while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yousef</ENAMEX> was building the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bomb</ENAMEX> he would use in that attack, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> and Yousef
                had numerous telephone conversations during which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yousef</ENAMEX> discussed his progress and
                sought additional funding. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November 3, 1992</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> wired <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$660</NUMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Qatar</ENAMEX> to the
                bank account of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yousef</ENAMEX> 's co-conspirator, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mohammed Salameh</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> does not appear to
                have contributed any more substantially to this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX>.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yousef</ENAMEX> 's instant notoriety as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mastermind</ENAMEX> of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Trade Center</ENAMEX> bombing
                inspired <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> to become involved in planning attacks against the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. By
                his own account, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX>'s animus toward the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> stemmed not from his
                experiences there as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX>, but rather from his violent disagreement with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
                foreign policy favoring <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> accompanied <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yousef</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philippines</ENAMEX>,
                and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of them began planning what is now known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manila</ENAMEX> air or "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Bojinka</ENAMEX>"
                plot-the intended bombing of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> U.S. commercial jumbo <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">jets</ENAMEX> over the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific</ENAMEX> during a
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two-day</TIMEX> span. This marked the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> took part in the actual planning of a
                terrorist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX>. While sharing an <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manila</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer of 1994</TIMEX>,
                he and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yousef</ENAMEX> acquired chemicals and other materials necessary to construct bombs
                and timers. They also cased target flights to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Seoul</ENAMEX> that would have
                onward legs to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. During this same period, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yousef</ENAMEX> also
                developed plans to assassinate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> during his <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November 1994</TIMEX> trip to
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manila</ENAMEX>, and to bomb <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>-bound cargo <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">carriers</ENAMEX> by smuggling jackets containing
                nitrocellulose on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX>.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> left the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philippines</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 1994</TIMEX> and met up with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yousef</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Karachi</ENAMEX>
                following their casing flights. There they enlisted <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wali Khan Amin Shah</ENAMEX>, also known
                as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Usama Asmurai</ENAMEX>, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manila</ENAMEX> air plot. During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fall of 1994</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yousef</ENAMEX> returned
                to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manila</ENAMEX> and successfully tested the digital watch timer he had invented, bombing a
                movie <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">theater</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philippine Airlines</ENAMEX> flight en route to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX>. The plot unraveled
                after the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Philippine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> discovered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yousef</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bomb</ENAMEX>-making <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX> in
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manila</ENAMEX>; but by that time, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> was safely back at his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> job in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Qatar</ENAMEX>. Yousef
                attempted to follow through on the cargo <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carriers</ENAMEX> plan, but he was arrested in
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Islamabad</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pakistani</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February 7, 1995</TIMEX>, after an accomplice turned
                him in.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> continued to travel among the worldwide jihadist <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yousef</ENAMEX> 's
                arrest, visiting the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sudan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malaysia</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brazil</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>. No clear evidence
                connects him to terrorist activities in those locations. While in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sudan</ENAMEX>, he
                reportedly failed in his attempt to meet with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>. But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> did see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atef</ENAMEX>, who
                gave him a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contact</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brazil</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 1996</TIMEX>, well aware that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> were
                chasing him, he left <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Qatar</ENAMEX> for good and fled to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>, where he renewed his
                relationship with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rasul Sayyaf</ENAMEX>.
            
            Just as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> was reestablishing himself in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-1996</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> and his
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> were also completing their migration from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sudan</ENAMEX>. Through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atef</ENAMEX>, KSM
                arranged a meeting with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin inTora Bora</ENAMEX>, a mountainous redoubt from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Afghan</ENAMEX>
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">war days</TIMEX>. At the meeting, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> presented the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> with a menu of ideas for
                terrorist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX>. According to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX>, this meeting was the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time he had seen
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX>. Although they had fought together in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> and KSM
                did not yet enjoy an especially close working relationship. Indeed, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> has
                acknowledged that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin likely</ENAMEX> agreed to meet with him because of the renown of
                his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nephew</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yousef</ENAMEX>.
            
            At the meeting, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> briefed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atef</ENAMEX> on the first <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Trade Center</ENAMEX>
                bombing, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manila</ENAMEX> air plot, the cargo <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carriers</ENAMEX> plan, and other activities pursued
                by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philippines</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> also presented a proposal for an
                operation that would involve training <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilots</ENAMEX> who would crash <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX> into <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX>
                in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. This proposal eventually would become the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX>.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> knew that the successful staging of such an attack would require <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX>,
                money, and logistical support that only an extensive and well-funded organization
                like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> could provide. He thought the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX> might appeal to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>, who
                had a long record of denouncing the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>.
            
            From <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX>'s perspective, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> was in the process of consolidating his new
                position in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> while hearing out others' ideas, and had not yet settled on
                an agenda for future anti-U.S. operations. At the meeting, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> listened to
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX>'s ideas without much comment, but did ask <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> formally to join <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> and move
                his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> declined. He preferred to remain independent and retain the option of working
                with other mujahideen <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> still operating in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>, including the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> led
                by his old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mentor</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sayyaf</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sayyaf</ENAMEX> was close to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ahmed Shah Massoud</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> of the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern Alliance</ENAMEX>. Therefore working with him might be a problem for KSM because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bin</ENAMEX>
                Ladin was building ties to the rival <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX>.
            After meeting with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> says he journeyed onward to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indonesia</ENAMEX>, and
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malaysia</ENAMEX>, where he met with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jemaah Islamiah's Hambali</ENAMEX>. Hambali was an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indonesian</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">veteran</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Afghan</ENAMEX> war looking to expand the jihad into <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southeast Asia</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX>,
                KSM rejoined his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> and arranged to move them to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Karachi</ENAMEX>; he claims to have
                relocated by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 1997</TIMEX>.
            
            After settling his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Karachi</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> tried to join the mujahid <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ibn al</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Khattab</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chechnya</ENAMEX>. Unable to travel through <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Azerbaijan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> returned to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Karachi</ENAMEX>
                and then to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> to renew contacts with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX>. Though
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> may not have been a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> at this time, he admits traveling
                frequently between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997 and the first half of 1998</TIMEX>,
                visiting <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> and cultivating relationships with his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lieutenants</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atef</ENAMEX> and Sayf
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Adl</ENAMEX>, by assisting them with computer and media projects.
            
            According to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX>, the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX> bombings of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">embassies</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nairobi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dar es</ENAMEX>
                Salaam marked a watershed in the evolution of the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">9/11</NUMEX> plot. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> claims these
                bombings convinced him that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> was truly committed to attacking the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX>. He continued to make himself useful, collecting news articles and helping
                other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> with their outdated computer equipment. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>, apparently
                at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atef</ENAMEX> 's urging, finally decided to give <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> the green light for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 9/11</TIMEX>
                operation sometime in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late 1998</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 1999</TIMEX>.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> then accepted <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>'s standing invitation to move to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kandahar</ENAMEX> and work
                directly with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>. In addition to supervising the planning and preparations for
                the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> worked with and eventually led <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>'s media <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committee</ENAMEX>.
                But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> he refused to swear a formal oath of allegiance to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>, thereby
                retaining a last vestige of his cherished autonomy.
            
            At this point, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late 1998 to early 1999</TIMEX>, planning for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX> began in
                earnest. Yet while the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">9/11</ENAMEX> project occupied the bulk of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX>'s attention, he
                continued to consider other possibilities for terrorist attacks. For example, he
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sent al Qaeda</ENAMEX> operative <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Issa al Britani</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuala Lumpur</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malaysia</ENAMEX>, to learn about
                the jihad in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southeast Asia</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hambali</ENAMEX>. Thereafter, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> claims, at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>'s
                direction in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 2001</TIMEX>, he sent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Britani</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> to case potential
                economic and "<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX>" targets in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York City</ENAMEX>. Furthermore, during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer</TIMEX> of
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> approached <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> with the idea of recruiting a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Saudi Arabian</ENAMEX> air force
                pilot to commandeer a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Saudi</ENAMEX> fighter <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">jet</ENAMEX> and attack the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eilat</ENAMEX>. Bin
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ladin</ENAMEX> reportedly liked this proposal, but he instructed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> to concentrate on the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">9/11</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX> first. Similarly, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX>'s proposals to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atef</ENAMEX> around this same time for
                attacks in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Thailand</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Singapore</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indonesia</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maldives</ENAMEX> were never executed,
                although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hambali</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jemaah Islamiah</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX> did some casing of possible
                    targets.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> appears to have been popular among the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> rank and file. He was reportedly
                regarded as an effective <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX>, especially after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 9/11</TIMEX> attacks. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Co-workers</ENAMEX>
                describe him as an intelligent, efficient, and even-tempered <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> who approached
                his projects with a single-minded dedication that he expected his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> to
                share. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Qaeda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">associate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abu Zubaydah</ENAMEX> has expressed more qualified admiration for
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX>'s innate creativity, emphasizing instead his ability to incorporate the
                improvements suggested by others. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nashiri</ENAMEX> has been similarly measured, observing
                that although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> floated many general ideas for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">attacks</ENAMEX>, he rarely conceived a
                specific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX> himself. 19 Perhaps these estimates reflect a touch of jealousy;
                in any case, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> was plainly a capable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coordinator</ENAMEX>, having had <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> to hone his
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">skills</ENAMEX> and build relationships.
            Hambali
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Qaeda</ENAMEX>'s success in fostering terrorism in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southeast Asia</ENAMEX> stems largely from its
                close relationship with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jemaah Islamiah</ENAMEX> (JI). In that relationship, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hambali</ENAMEX> became
                the key <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coordinator</ENAMEX>. Born and educated in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indonesia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hambali</ENAMEX> moved to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malaysia</ENAMEX> in
                the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 1980s</TIMEX> to find work. There he claims to have become a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">follower</ENAMEX> of the
                Islamist <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">extremist</ENAMEX> teachings of various <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clerics</ENAMEX>, including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abdullah</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sungkar</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sungkar</ENAMEX> first inspired <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hambali</ENAMEX> to share the vision of establishing a
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">radical Islamist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southeast Asia</ENAMEX>, then furthered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hambali</ENAMEX>'s instruction in
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">jihad</ENAMEX> by sending him to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX>. After undergoing training at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rasul</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sayyaf</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sada</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camp</ENAMEX> (where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> would later train), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hambali</ENAMEX> fought against the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Soviets</ENAMEX>; he eventually returned to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malaysia</ENAMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18 months</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>,
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hambali</ENAMEX> would assume responsibility for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malaysia</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Singapore</ENAMEX> region within
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sungkar</ENAMEX>'s newly formed terrorist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JI</ENAMEX>.
            
            Also by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sungkar</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JI</ENAMEX> spiritual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abu Bakar Bashir</ENAMEX> had accepted Bin
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ladin</ENAMEX>'s offer to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ally</ENAMEX> JI with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> in waging war against <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christians</ENAMEX> and
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jews</ENAMEX>.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hambali</ENAMEX> met with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Karachi</ENAMEX> to arrange for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> to receive training in
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camps</ENAMEX>. In addition to his close working relationship with
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hambali</ENAMEX> soon began dealing with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atef</ENAMEX> as well. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Qaeda</ENAMEX> began funding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JI</ENAMEX>'s
                increasingly ambitious terrorist plans, which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atef</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> sought to expand. Under
                this arrangement, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JI</ENAMEX> would perform the necessary casing activities and locate
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bomb</ENAMEX>-making <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">materials</ENAMEX> and other supplies. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Al Qaeda</ENAMEX> would underwrite operations,
                provide bomb-making expertise, and deliver suicide <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX>.
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda-JI</ENAMEX> partnership yielded a number of proposals that would marry <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>'s
                financial and technical strengths with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JI</ENAMEX>'s access to materials and local
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX>. Here, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hambali</ENAMEX> played the critical role of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coordinator</ENAMEX>, as he distributed
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> funds earmarked for the joint <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX>. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> especially notable
                example, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atef</ENAMEX> turned to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hambali</ENAMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> needed a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scientist</ENAMEX> to take over its
                biological weapons program. Hambali obliged by introducing a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>- educated JI
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yazid Sufaat</ENAMEX>, to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ayman al Zawahiri</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kandahar</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sufaat</ENAMEX> would spend
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several months</TIMEX> attempting to cultivate anthrax for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> in a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX> he
                helped set up near the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kandahar</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX>.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hambali</ENAMEX> did not originally orient <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JI</ENAMEX>'s operations toward attacking the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>,
                but his involvement with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> appears to have inspired him to pursue American
                targets. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX>, in his post-capture interrogations, has taken credit for this shift,
                claiming to have urged the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JI</ENAMEX> operations <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> to concentrate on attacks designed to
                hurt the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> economy.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hambali</ENAMEX>'s newfound interest in striking against the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> manifested itself
                in a spate of terrorist plans. Fortunately, none came to fruition.
            In addition to staging actual terrorist attacks in partnership with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>, Hambali
                and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JI</ENAMEX> assisted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX> passing through <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuala Lumpur</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> important
                occasion was in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 1999-January 2000</TIMEX>. Hambali accommodated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX>'s requests to
                help several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">veterans</ENAMEX> whom <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> had just finished training in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Karachi</ENAMEX>. They included
                Tawfiq bin <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Attash</ENAMEX>, also known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Khallad</ENAMEX>, who later would help bomb the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">USS Cole</ENAMEX>,
                and future <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hijackers</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nawaf al Hazmi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Khalid al Mihdhar</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hambali</ENAMEX> arranged
                lodging for them and helped them purchase airline tickets for their onward travel.
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Later that year</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hambali</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crew</ENAMEX> would provide accommodations and other
                assistance (including information on flight <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> and help in acquiring ammonium
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nitrate</ENAMEX>) for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zacarias Moussaoui</ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> operative sent to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malaysia</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atef</ENAMEX> and
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX>.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hambali</ENAMEX> used <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Afghan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> as a training <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ground</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recruits</ENAMEX>.
                Though he had a close relationship with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atef</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX>, he maintained <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JI</ENAMEX>'s
                institutional independence from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hambali</ENAMEX> insists that he did not discuss
                operations with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> or swear allegiance to him, having already given such a
                pledge of loyalty to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bashir</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sungkar</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">successor</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX>. Thus, like any
                powerful <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bureaucrat</ENAMEX> defending his domain, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hambali</ENAMEX> objected when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> leadership
                tried to assign <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> to terrorist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">projects</ENAMEX> without notifying him.
            
            Abd <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">al Rahim al Nashiri</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">KSM</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hambali</ENAMEX> both decided to join forces with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>
                because their terrorist aspirations required the money and manpower that only a
                robust <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> could supply. On the other hand, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Abd al Rahim al</ENAMEX>
                Nashiri-the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mastermind</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cole</ENAMEX> bombing and the eventual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>
                operations in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arabian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Peninsula</ENAMEX>-appears to have originally been recruited to his
                career as a terrorist by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> himself.
            Having already participated in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Afghan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">jihad</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nashiri</ENAMEX> accompanied a group of some
                <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> mujahideen in pursuit of jihad in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tajikistan</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>. When serious fighting
                failed to materialize, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> traveled to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jalalabad</ENAMEX> and encountered <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>,
                who had recently returned from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sudan</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> addressed them at length, urging the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> to join him in a "jihad against the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>." Although all were urged to
                swear loyalty to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>, many, including <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nashiri</ENAMEX>, found the notion distasteful
                and refused. After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several days</TIMEX> of indoctrination that included a barrage of news
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clippings</ENAMEX> and television documentaries, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nashiri</ENAMEX> left <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>, first returning to
                his native <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX> and then visiting his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX>. There, he says, the
                idea for his first terrorist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX> took shape as he noticed many <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> and other
                foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ships</ENAMEX> plying the waters along the southwest coast of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX>.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nashiri</ENAMEX> returned to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>, probably in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>, primarily to check on relatives
                fighting there and also to learn about the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX>. He again encountered <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>,
                still recruiting for "the coming battle with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>." <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Nashiri</ENAMEX> pursued a
                more conventional military jihad, joining the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Taliban</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> in their fight against
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ahmed Massoud</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern Alliance</ENAMEX> and shuttling back and forth between the front and
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kandahar</ENAMEX>, where he would see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> and meet with other mujahideen. During <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this</TIMEX>
                period, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nashiri</ENAMEX> also led a plot to smuggle <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX>-made <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">antitank missiles</ENAMEX> into
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 1998</TIMEX> and helped an embassy bombing operative obtain
                a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Yemeni</ENAMEX> passport.
            
            At some point, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nashiri</ENAMEX> joined <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>. His <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cousin</ENAMEX>, Jihad <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mohammad Ali al Makki</ENAMEX>, also
                known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Azzam</ENAMEX>, was a suicide <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bomber</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nairobi</ENAMEX> attack. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nashiri</ENAMEX> traveled
                between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>. In late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nashiri</ENAMEX> proposed mounting an attack
                against a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessel</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> approved. He directed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nashiri</ENAMEX> to start the planning
                and send <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX>, and he later provided money.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nashiri</ENAMEX> reported directly to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>, the only other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> who, according to
                Nashiri, knew all the details of the operation. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nashiri</ENAMEX> had difficulty finding
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> naval <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX> to attack along the western coast of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> reportedly
                instructed him to case the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Port of Aden</ENAMEX>, on the southern coast, instead.
            
            The eventual result was an attempted attack on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">USS The Sullivans</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 2000</TIMEX>
                and the successful attack, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 2000</TIMEX>, on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">USS Cole</ENAMEX>.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nashiri</ENAMEX>'s success brought him instant status within <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>. He later was recognized
                as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> operations in and around the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Arabian Peninsula</ENAMEX>. While
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nashiri</ENAMEX> continued to consult <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> on the planning of subsequent terrorist
                <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">projects</ENAMEX>, he retained discretion in selecting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX> and devising attacks. In
                the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</TIMEX> between the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cole</ENAMEX> bombing and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nashiri</ENAMEX>'s capture, he would supervise
                several more proposed operations for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>. The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 6, 2002</TIMEX>, bombing of the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">French</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">tanker</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Limburg</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gulf of Aden</ENAMEX> also was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nashiri</ENAMEX>'s handiwork. Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bin</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ladin</ENAMEX> urged <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nashiri</ENAMEX> to continue plotting strikes against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> interests in the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Persian Gulf</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nashiri</ENAMEX> maintains that he actually delayed one of these projects
                because of security concerns<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.31</NUMEX>Those <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concerns</ENAMEX>, it seems, were well placed, as
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nashiri</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November 2002</TIMEX> capture in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United Arab Emirates</ENAMEX> finally ended his career
                as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorist</ENAMEX>.
            THE "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">PLANES OPERATION</ENAMEX>"
            According to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX>, he started to think about attacking the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> after Yousef
                returned to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> following the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Trade Center</ENAMEX> bombing. Like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yousef</ENAMEX>, KSM
                reasoned he could best influence <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> policy by targeting the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>'s economy. KSM
                and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yousef</ENAMEX> reportedly brainstormed together about what drove the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> economy. New
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">York</ENAMEX>, which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> considered the economic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">capital</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, therefore
                became the primary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX>. For similar reasons, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> also became a target for
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX>.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> claims that the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> bombing of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Trade Center</ENAMEX> taught him that bombs
                and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">explosives</ENAMEX> could be problematic, and that he needed to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">graduate</ENAMEX> to a more novel
                form of attack. He maintains that he and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yousef</ENAMEX> began thinking about using aircraft
                as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX> while working on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manila</ENAMEX> air/Bojinka plot, and speculated about
                striking the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Trade Center</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">as early as 1995</TIMEX>.
            
            Certainly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> was not alone in contemplating new kinds of terrorist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX>. A
                study reportedly conducted by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atef</ENAMEX>, while he and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> were still in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sudan</ENAMEX>,
                concluded that traditional terrorist hijacking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> did not fit the needs of
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>, because such hijackings were used to negotiate the release of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prisoners</ENAMEX>
                rather than to inflict mass casualties. The study is said to have considered the
                feasibility of hijacking <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX> and blowing them up in flight, paralleling the
                Bojinka concept. Such a study, if it actually existed, yields significant insight
                into the thinking of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX>: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) they rejected hijackings aimed at
                gaining the release of imprisoned <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">comrades</ENAMEX> as too complex, because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> had no
                friendly <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> in which to land a plane and then negotiate; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) they considered
                the bombing of commercial flights in midair-as carried out against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan Am</ENAMEX> Flight 103
                over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lockerbie</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Scotland</ENAMEX>- a promising means to inflict massive casualties; and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>)
                they did not yet consider using hijacked <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX> against other
                    targets.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> has insisted to his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">interrogators</ENAMEX> that he always contemplated hijacking and
                crashing large commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX>. Indeed, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> describes a grandiose original plan:
                a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> to be hijacked, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> of which would crash into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> on
                both coasts-they included those eventually hit on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 11</TIMEX> plus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX>, nuclear power <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>, and the tallest <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> and the
                state of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">KSM</ENAMEX> himself was to land the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">tenth</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> at a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX> and,
                after killing all adult male <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> and alerting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX>, deliver a
                speech excoriating <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> support for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philippines</ENAMEX>, and repressive
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> world. Beyond <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX>'s rationalizations about targeting the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> economy, this vision gives a better glimpse of his true ambitions. This is
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">theater</ENAMEX>, a spectacle of destruction with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> as the self-cast <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">star</ENAMEX>-the
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">superterrorist</ENAMEX>.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> concedes that this proposal received a lukewarm response from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX>
                skeptical of its scale and complexity. Although <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> listened to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX>'s
                proposal, he was not convinced that it was practical. As mentioned <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bin</ENAMEX>
                Ladin was receiving numerous ideas for potential <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX>- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX>'s proposal to
                attack <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> with commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">airplanes</ENAMEX> was only one of many.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> presents himself as an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">entrepreneur</ENAMEX> seeking venture capital and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>. He simply
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">wanted al Qaeda</ENAMEX> to supply the money and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX> needed for the attack while
                retaining his independence. It is easy to question such a statement. Money is one
                thing; supplying a cadre of trained <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX> willing to die is much more. Thus,
                although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> contends he would have been just as likely to consider working with any
                comparable terrorist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>, he gives no indication of what other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> he
                thought could supply such exceptional commodities.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> acknowledges formally joining <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late 1998 or 1999</TIMEX>, and states that
                soon afterward, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> also made the decision to support his proposal to attack
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> using commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">airplanes</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX>. Though <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> speculates about
                how <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> came to share his preoccupation with attacking <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> in
                fact had long been an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">opponent</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> thinks that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atef</ENAMEX> may have
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">persuaded Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> to approve this specific proposal. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atef</ENAMEX> 's role in the entire
                operation is unquestionably very significant but tends to fade into the background,
                in part because <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atef</ENAMEX> himself is not available to describe it. He was killed in
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November 2001</TIMEX> by an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> air strike in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> summoned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kandahar</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 1999</TIMEX> to tell him that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>
                would support his proposal. The plot was now referred to within <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> as the
                "planes operation."
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Plan</ENAMEX> Evolves
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> reportedly discussed the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX> operation with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atef</ENAMEX> in a series of
                meetings in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the spring of 1999</TIMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">al Matar</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kandahar</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX>'s original
                concept of using one of the hijacked <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX> to make a media statement was scrapped,
                but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> considered the basic idea feasible. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Atef</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> developed
                an initial list of targets. These included the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Capitol</ENAMEX>, the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Trade Center</ENAMEX>. According to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> wanted to destroy
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> wanted to strike the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Trade Center</ENAMEX>, and
                all of them wanted to hit the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Capitol</ENAMEX>. No one else was involved in the initial
                selection of targets.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> also soon selected <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> to serve as suicide <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX>: Khalid
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Mihdhar</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nawaf al Hazmi</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Khallad</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abu Bara al Yemeni</ENAMEX>. During the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">al</ENAMEX> Matar
                meetings, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> told <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mihdhar</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX> were so eager to participate in
                an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX> against the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> that they had already obtained <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> visas.
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">KSM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> that they had done so on their own after the suicide of their friend
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Azzam</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nashiri</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cousin</ENAMEX>) in carrying out the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nairobi</ENAMEX> bombing. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> had not met them.
                His only guidance from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> was that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> should eventually go to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX> for pilot training.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mihdhar</ENAMEX> were <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Saudi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nationals</ENAMEX>, born in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mecca</ENAMEX>. Like the others in this
                initial group of selectees, they were already experienced mujahideen. They had
                traveled together to fight in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bosnia</ENAMEX> in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> that journeyed to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Balkans</ENAMEX> in
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>. By the time <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hazmi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mihdhar</ENAMEX> were assigned to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX> operation in early
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>, they had visited <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> on several occasions.
            
            Khallad was another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">veteran</ENAMEX> mujahid, like much of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>. His <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> had been
                expelled from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX> because of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">extremist</ENAMEX> views. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Khallad</ENAMEX> had grown up in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arabia</ENAMEX>, where his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> knew <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abdullah Azzam</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Omar Abdel Rahman</ENAMEX> (the
                "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Blind Sheikh"</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Khallad</ENAMEX> departed for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the age of 15</TIMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Three</TIMEX>
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years later</TIMEX>, he lost his lower right leg in a battle with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern Alliance</ENAMEX>, a
                battle in which one of his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brothers</ENAMEX> died. After this experience, he pledged
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">allegiance to Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>-whom he had first met as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jeddah</ENAMEX>-and volunteered
                to become a suicide operative.
            
            When <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Khallad</ENAMEX> applied for a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> visa, however, his application was denied. Earlier in
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> had sent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Khallad</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX> to help <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nashiri</ENAMEX> obtain explosives for the
                planned ship-bombing and to obtain a visa to visit the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, so that he
                could participate in an operation there. Khallad applied under another name, using
                the cover story that he would be visiting a medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinic</ENAMEX> to obtain a new
                prosthesis for his leg. Another <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> operative gave <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Khallad</ENAMEX> the name of a person
                living in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> whom <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Khallad</ENAMEX> could use as a point of contact on a visa
                application. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Khallad</ENAMEX> contacted this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> to help him get an appointment at a
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinic</ENAMEX>. While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Khallad</ENAMEX> was waiting for the letter from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinic</ENAMEX> confirming the
                appointment, however, he was arrested by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Yemeni</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX>. The arrest resulted
                from mistaken identity: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Khallad</ENAMEX> was driving the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> of another conspirator in the
                ship-bombing plot who was wanted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Yemeni</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX>.
            
            Khallad was released <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sometime</TIMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer of 1999</TIMEX>, after his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bin</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ladin</ENAMEX> intervened on his behalf. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Khallad</ENAMEX> learned later that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX>,
                apparently concerned that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Khallad</ENAMEX> might reveal <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Nashiri</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX> while under
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interrogation</ENAMEX>, had contacted a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Yemeni</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> to demand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Khallad</ENAMEX>'s release,
                suggesting that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> would not confront the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yemenis</ENAMEX> if they did not confront
                him. This account has been corroborated by others. Giving up on acquiring a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">visa</ENAMEX> and concerned that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> might learn of his ties to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>,
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Khallad</ENAMEX> returned to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>.
            
            Travel issues thus played a part in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>'s operational planning from the very
                start. During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the spring</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer of 1999</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> realized that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Khallad</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abu Bara</ENAMEX>,
                both of whom were <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yemenis</ENAMEX>, would not be able to obtain <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> visas as easily as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saudi</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mihdhar</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX>. Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Khallad</ENAMEX> had been unable to acquire a
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> visa, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> still wanted him and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abu Bara</ENAMEX>, as well as another <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Yemeni</ENAMEX> operative
                from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>'s security detail, to participate in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX> operation. Yet
                because <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Saudi</ENAMEX> passports could travel much more easily than <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Yemeni</ENAMEX>,
                particularly to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, there were fewer martyrdom opportunities for
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yemenis</ENAMEX>. To overcome this problem, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> decided to split the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX> into
                <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> components.
            
            The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX> operation-crashing hijacked <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft</ENAMEX> into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>
                targets-would remain as planned, with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mihdhar</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX> playing key roles. The
                <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> part, however, would now embrace the idea of using suicide <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX> to blow
                <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX>, a refinement of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX>'s old <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manila</ENAMEX> air plot. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX> would hijack
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX>-flagged commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX> flying <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pacific</ENAMEX> routes across <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Asia</ENAMEX> and destroy
                them in midair, possibly with shoe bombs, instead of flying them into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX>. (An
                alternate scenario apparently involved flying <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX> into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>,
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Singapore</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Korea</ENAMEX>.) This part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX> has been confirmed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Khallad</ENAMEX>, who
                said that they contemplated hijacking several <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX>, probably originating in
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Thailand</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Korea</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malaysia</ENAMEX>, and using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yemenis</ENAMEX> who would not need
                pilot training because they would simply down the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX>. All the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX> hijacked in
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Asia</ENAMEX> were to be crashed or exploded at about the same
                time to maximize the attack's psychological impact.
            
            Training and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deployment</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuala Lumpur</ENAMEX> In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fall of 1999</TIMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX>
                selected by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX> were chosen to attend an elite
                training <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">course</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda's Mes Aynak</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camp</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> personally
                selected the veteran <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fighters</ENAMEX> who received this training, and several of them were
                destined for important <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> example is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ibrahim al Thawar</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nibras</ENAMEX>, who
                would participate in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 12, 2000</TIMEX>, suicide attack on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">USS Cole</ENAMEX>. According
                to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX>, this training was not given specifically in preparation for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX>
                operation or any other particular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">venture</ENAMEX>. Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> claims not to have
                been involved with the training or to have met with the future <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX> hijackers at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mes</ENAMEX>
                Aynak, he says he did visit the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camp</ENAMEX> while traveling from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kandahar</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kabul</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bin</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ladin</ENAMEX> and others.
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mes Aynak</ENAMEX> training <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camp</ENAMEX> was located in an abandoned <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">copper mine</ENAMEX> near
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kabul</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camp</ENAMEX> opened in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>, after the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> had destroyed the training
                <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">camp</ENAMEX> near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Khowst</ENAMEX> with cruise <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">missiles</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 1998</TIMEX>, and before theTaliban granted
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> permission to open the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Faruq</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camp</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kandahar</ENAMEX>. Thus, for a brief period
                in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mes Aynak</ENAMEX> was the only <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> camp operating in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>. It offered a
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">full</TIMEX> range of instruction, including an advanced commando course taught by senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qaeda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sayf al Adl</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> paid particular attention to the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX> training
                session. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salah al Din</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">trainer</ENAMEX> for the session, complained about the number
                of trainees and said that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">no more than 20</NUMEX> could be handled at once, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>
                insisted that everyone he had selected receive the training.
            
            The special training session at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mes Aynak</ENAMEX> was rigorous and spared no expense. The
                course focused on physical fitness, firearms, close <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">quarters</ENAMEX> combat, shooting from a
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">motorcycle</ENAMEX>, and night operations. Although the subjects taught differed little from
                those offered at other <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camps</ENAMEX>, the course placed extraordinary physical and mental
                demands on its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>, who received the best <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> and other amenities to
                enhance their strength and morale.
            
            Upon completing the advanced training at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mes Aynak, Hazmi, Khallad</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abu Bara</ENAMEX> went
                to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Karachi</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>. There KSM instructed them on Western culture and travel. Much
                of his activity in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-1999</TIMEX> had revolved around the collection of training and
                informational materials for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX> operation. For instance,
                he collected <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Western</ENAMEX> aviation <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">magazines</ENAMEX>; telephone directories for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX>
                such as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Long Beach</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>; brochures for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>; and airline
                timetables, and he conducted Internet searches on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> flight <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>. He also
                purchased flight simulator software and a few movies depicting hijackings. To house
                his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> rented a safehouse in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Karachi</ENAMEX> with money provided by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bin</ENAMEX>
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ladin</ENAMEX>.
            
            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early December 1999</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Khallad</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abu Bara</ENAMEX> arrived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Karachi</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX> joined them
                there <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few days later</TIMEX>. On his way to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Karachi</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hazmi</ENAMEX> spent <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">a night</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Quetta</ENAMEX> at a
                safehouse where, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Egyptian</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mohamed Atta</ENAMEX> simultaneously
                stayed on his way to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> for jihad training.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mihdhar</ENAMEX> did not attend the training in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Karachi</ENAMEX> with the others. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> says that he
                never met with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mihdhar</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX> but assumed that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atef</ENAMEX> had briefed
                Mihdhar on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX> operation and had excused him from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Karachi</ENAMEX> training.
            
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">course</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Karachi</ENAMEX> apparently lasted <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about one or two weeks</TIMEX>. According to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX>, he
                taught the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX> basic <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> words and phrases. He showed them how to
                read phone books, interpret airline timetables, use the Internet, use code words in
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">communications</ENAMEX>, make travel reservations, and rent an <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Khallad</ENAMEX> adds that
                the training involved using flight <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">simulator</ENAMEX> computer games, viewing movies that
                featured hijackings, and reading flight schedules to determine which flights would
                be in the air at the same time in different parts of the world. They used the game
                software to increase their familiarity with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">aircraft models</ENAMEX> and functions, and to
                highlight gaps in cabin security. While in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Karachi</ENAMEX>, they also discussed how to case
                flights in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southeast Asia</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> told them to watch the cabin doors at takeoff and
                landing, to observe whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">captain</ENAMEX> went to the lavatory during the flight, and
                to note whether the flight <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attendants</ENAMEX> brought <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> into the cockpit. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Khallad</ENAMEX>,
                and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX> also visited travel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> to learn the visa requirements for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asian</ENAMEX>
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>.
            
            The <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">four trainees</NUMEX> traveled to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuala Lumpur</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Khallad</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abu Bara</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hazmi</ENAMEX> came from
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Karachi; Mihdhar</ENAMEX> traveled from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX>. As discussed in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">chapter 6</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> intelligence
                would analyze communications associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mihdhar</ENAMEX>, whom they identified during
                this travel, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hazmi</ENAMEX>, whom they could have identified but did not.
            
            According to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX> were aware that they had volunteered for a
                suicide operation, either in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> or in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX>. With different roles,
                they had different tasks. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mihdhar</ENAMEX> were sent to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuala Lumpur</ENAMEX> before
                proceeding to their final destination-the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. According to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX>, they were
                to use <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Yemeni</ENAMEX> documents to fly to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malaysia</ENAMEX>, then proceed to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> using
                their <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Saudi</ENAMEX> passports to conceal their prior travels to and from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> had
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">doctored Hazmi</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Saudi</ENAMEX> passport so it would appear as if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX> had traveled to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuala</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lumpur</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX> via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dubai</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Khallad</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abu Bara</ENAMEX> went to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuala Lumpur</ENAMEX> to
                study airport security and conduct casing flights. According to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Khallad</ENAMEX>, he and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abu</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bara</ENAMEX> departed for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malaysia</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-December 1999</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX> joined them about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten days</TIMEX>
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later</TIMEX> after briefly returning to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> to attend to some passport issues.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Khallad</ENAMEX> had originally scheduled his trip in order to receive a new prosthesis at a
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuala Lumpur</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinic</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Endolite</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> suggested that he use the
                opportunity to case flights as well. According to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Khallad</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malaysia</ENAMEX> was an ideal
                destination because its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> did not require <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX> or other
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gulf</ENAMEX> states to have a visa. <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Malaysian</ENAMEX> security was reputed to be lax when it came to
                Islamist jihadists. Also, other mujahideen wounded in combat had reportedly received
                treatment at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Endolite</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinic</ENAMEX> and successfully concealed the origins of their
                injuries. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Khallad</ENAMEX> said he got the money for the prosthesis from his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bin</ENAMEX>
                Ladin, and another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleague</ENAMEX>.
            
            According to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Khallad</ENAMEX>, when he and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abu Bara</ENAMEX> arrived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuala Lumpur</ENAMEX> they contacted
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hambali</ENAMEX> to let him know where they were staying, since he was to be kept informed of
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> activities in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southeast Asia</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hambali</ENAMEX> picked up <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Khallad</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abu Bara</ENAMEX> and
                brought them to his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX>, enlisting the help of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleague</ENAMEX> who spoke better <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Arabic</ENAMEX>.
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hambali</ENAMEX> then took them to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinic</ENAMEX>.
            
            On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 31</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Khallad</ENAMEX> flew from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuala Lumpur</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bangkok</ENAMEX>; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next day</TIMEX>, he flew to
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> aboard a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">airliner</ENAMEX>. He flew in <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> class, which he realized was a
                mistake because this seating assignment on that flight did not afford him a view of
                the cockpit. He claims to have done what he could to case the flight, testing
                security by carrying a box cutter in his toiletries kit onto the flight to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kong</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Khallad</ENAMEX> returned to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bangkok</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the following day</TIMEX>. At the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX>, the security
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> searched his carry-on bag and even opened the toiletries kit, but just
                glanced at the contents and let him pass. On this flight, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Khallad</ENAMEX> waited until most
                of the first-class <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> were dozing, then got up and removed the kit from his
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">carry-on</ENAMEX>. None of the flight <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attendants</ENAMEX> took notice.
            
            After completing his casing mission, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Khallad</ENAMEX> returned to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuala Lumpur</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hazmi</ENAMEX> arrived
                in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuala Lumpur</ENAMEX> soon thereafter and may even have stayed briefly with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Khallad</ENAMEX> and
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abu Bara</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Endolite</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mihdhar</ENAMEX> arrived on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 5</TIMEX>, probably <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX>.
                <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">All four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX> stayed at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yazid Sufaat</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Malaysian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JI</ENAMEX> member
                who made his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">home</ENAMEX> available at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hambali</ENAMEX>'s request. According to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Khallad</ENAMEX>, he and Hazmi
                spoke about the possibility of hijacking <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX> and crashing them or holding
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hostages</ENAMEX>, but only speculatively. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Khallad</ENAMEX> admits being aware at the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mihdhar</ENAMEX> were involved in an operation involving <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX> in the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX> but denies knowing details of the plan.
            
            While in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuala Lumpur</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Khallad</ENAMEX> wanted to go to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Singapore</ENAMEX> to meet <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nibras</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fahd al</ENAMEX>
                Quso, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nashiri</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ship</ENAMEX>-bombing operation. An attempt to
                execute that plan by attacking the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">USS The Sullivans</ENAMEX> had failed just <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a few days</TIMEX>
                earlier. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nibras</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quso</ENAMEX> were bringing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Khallad</ENAMEX> money from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX>, but were stopped in
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bangkok</ENAMEX> because they lacked visas to continue on to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Singapore</ENAMEX>. Also unable to enter
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Singapore</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Khallad</ENAMEX> moved the meeting to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bangkok</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mihdhar</ENAMEX> decided to go
                there as well, reportedly because they thought it would enhance their cover as
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tourists</ENAMEX> to have passport stamps from a popular tourist destination such as
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Thailand</ENAMEX>. With <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hambali</ENAMEX>'s help, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> obtained tickets for a flight to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bangkok</ENAMEX>
                and left <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuala Lumpur</ENAMEX> together. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abu Bara</ENAMEX> did not have a visa permitting him to
                return to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>, so he traveled to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX> instead.
            
            In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bangkok</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Khallad</ENAMEX> took <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hazmi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mihdhar</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX>, then went to another hotel
                for his meeting on the maritime attack plan. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mihdhar</ENAMEX> soon moved to that
                same <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX>, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Khallad</ENAMEX> insists that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sets of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX> never met with each
                other or anyone else. After conferring with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ship</ENAMEX>-bombing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX>, Khallad
                returned to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Karachi</ENAMEX> and then to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kandahar</ENAMEX>, where he reported on his casing mission to
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> canceled the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Asia</ENAMEX> part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX> operation in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the spring of 2000</TIMEX>.
                He evidently decided it would be too difficult to coordinate this attack with the
                operation in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. As for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mihdhar</ENAMEX>, they had left <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bangkok</ENAMEX> a
                few <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Khallad</ENAMEX> and arrived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 15, 2000</TIMEX>.
            
            Meanwhile, the next <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX> destined for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX> operation
                had just surfaced in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>. As <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mihdhar</ENAMEX> were deploying from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX> to
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> was recruiting and training <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Western</ENAMEX>-educated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> who had recently arrived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kandahar</ENAMEX>. Though they hailed from
                <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> different <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United Arab Emirates</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lebanon</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX>-they
                had formed a close-knit <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hamburg</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>. The new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recruits</ENAMEX> had
                come to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> aspiring to wage jihad in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chechnya</ENAMEX>. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> quickly
                recognized their potential and enlisted them in its anti-U.S. jihad.
            THE <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HAMBURG CONTINGENT</ENAMEX>
            Although <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Atef</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> initially contemplated using established <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> to execute the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX> operation, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 1999</TIMEX> arrival in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kandahar</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
                aspiring jihadists from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> suddenly presented a more attractive alternative.
                The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hamburg</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> shared the anti-U.S. fervor of the other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> for the
                operation, but added the enormous advantages of fluency in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> and familiarity
                with life in the West, based on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> that each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> had spent living
                in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>. Not surprisingly, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mohamed Atta</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ramzi Binalshibh</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marwan al Shehhi</ENAMEX>, and
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ziad Jarrah</ENAMEX> would all become key <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">players</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 9/11</TIMEX> conspiracy.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mohamed Atta</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mohamed Atta</ENAMEX> was born on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 1, 1968</TIMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kafr el Sheikh</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX>, to a
                middle-class <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> headed by his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX>. After graduating from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cairo</ENAMEX>
                University with a degree in architectural <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">engineering</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> worked as an
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">urban</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">planner</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cairo</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of years</TIMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fall of 1991</TIMEX>, he asked a German
                family he had met in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cairo</ENAMEX> to help him continue his education in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>. They
                suggested he come to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hamburg</ENAMEX> and invited him to live with them there, at least
                initially. After completing a course in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> traveled to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> for the
                <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 1992</TIMEX>. He resided briefly in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Stuttgart</ENAMEX> and then, in the fall of
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX>, moved to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hamburg</ENAMEX> to live with his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host family</ENAMEX>. After enrolling at the
                University of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hamburg</ENAMEX>, he promptly transferred into the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> engineering and
                planning course at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg</ENAMEX>, where he would
                remain registered as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fall of 1999</TIMEX>. He appears to have applied
                himself fairly seriously to his studies (at least in comparison to his jihadist
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>) and actually received his degree shortly before traveling to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>.
                In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> came across as very intelligent and reasonably pleasant, with an
                excellent command of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> language.
            
            When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> arrived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>, he appeared religious, but not fanatically so. This
                would change, especially as his tendency to assert <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> became increasingly
                pronounced. According to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Binalshibh</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">as early as 1995</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> sought to organize a
                Muslim student <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hamburg</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fall of 1997</TIMEX>, he joined a working
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quds</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hamburg</ENAMEX>, a group designed to bridge the gap between
                <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslims</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christians</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> proved a poor <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX>, however, because of his abrasive
                and increasingly dogmatic personality. But among those who shared his beliefs, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX>
                stood out as a decisionmaker. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> during this period remember him as
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">charismatic</ENAMEX>, intelligent, and persuasive, albeit intolerant of dissent.
            
            In his interactions with other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> voiced virulently <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-Semitic</ENAMEX> and
                anti-American opinions, ranging from condemnations of what he described as a global
                <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> movement centered in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York City</ENAMEX> that supposedly controlled the financial
                world and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX>, to polemics against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> world. To him,
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX> was an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stooge</ENAMEX> set up to give <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> an excuse to
                intervene in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Middle East</ENAMEX>. Within his circle, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> advocated violent jihad. He
                reportedly asked <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> close to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> if he was "ready to fight for
                [his] belief" and dismissed him as too weak for jihad when the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> declined. On a
                visit home to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> met one of his college <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX>. According to this
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">friend</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> had changed a great deal, had grown a beard, and had "obviously adopted
                fundamentalism" by that time.
            
            Ramzi Binalshibh
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ramzi Binalshibh</ENAMEX> was born on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 1,1972</TIMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ghayl Bawazir</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX>. There does not seem
                to be anything remarkable about his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> or early background. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> who knew
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Binalshibh</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX> remembers him as "religious, but not too religious." <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">From 1987</TIMEX>
                to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Binalshibh</ENAMEX> worked as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clerk</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Bank</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX>. He first
                attempted to leave <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>, when he applied for a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> visa. After his
                application was rejected, he went to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> and applied for asylum under the name
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Ramzi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Omar</ENAMEX>, claiming to be a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Sudanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizen</ENAMEX> seeking asylum. While his asylum
                petition was pending, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Binalshibh</ENAMEX> lived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hamburg</ENAMEX> and associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>
                from several mosques there. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>, after his asylum application was denied,
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Binalshibh</ENAMEX> went home to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX> but returned to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> shortly thereafter under his
                true name, this time registering as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hamburg</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Binalshibh</ENAMEX> continually had
                academic problems, failing tests and cutting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX>; he was expelled from one
                school in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 1998</TIMEX>.
            
            According to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Binalshibh</ENAMEX>, he and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> first met at a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hamburg</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>. The
                <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> became close <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> and became identified with their shared extremist
                outlook. Like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX>, by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 1990s</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Binalshibh</ENAMEX> was decrying what he perceived to
                be a "<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Jewish</ENAMEX> world conspiracy." He proclaimed that the highest duty of every <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX>
                was to pursue jihad, and that the highest honor was to die during the jihad. Despite
                his rhetoric, however, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Binalshibh</ENAMEX> presented a more amiable figure than the austere
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX>, and was known within the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX> as being sociable, extroverted, polite, and
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adventuresome</ENAMEX>.
            
            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Binalshibh</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> began sharing an <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Harburg</ENAMEX> section of
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hamburg</ENAMEX>, together with a young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United Arab Emirates</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marwan al</ENAMEX>
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shehhi</ENAMEX>.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marwan al Shehhi</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marwan al Shehhi</ENAMEX> was born on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 9, 1978</TIMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ras al Khaimah</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United Arab</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Emirates</ENAMEX>. His <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX>, who died in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>, was a prayer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> at the local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX>.
                After graduating from high school in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shehhi</ENAMEX> joined the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Emirati</ENAMEX> military and
                received <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX> of basic training before gaining admission to a military
                scholarship program that would fund his continued study in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shehhi</ENAMEX> first entered <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 1996</TIMEX>. After sharing an <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bonn</ENAMEX> for
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two months</TIMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> other scholarship <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shehhi</ENAMEX> moved in with a German
                family, with whom he resided for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several months</TIMEX> before moving into his own
                apartment. During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this period</TIMEX>, he came across as very religious, praying <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> times
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a day</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Friends</ENAMEX> also remember him as convivial and "a regular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guy</ENAMEX>,"wearing Western
                clothes and occasionally renting <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cars</ENAMEX> for trips to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX>, and the
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Netherlands</ENAMEX>.
            
            As a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shehhi</ENAMEX> was less than a success. Upon completing a course in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX>, he
                enrolled at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bonn</ENAMEX> in a program for technical, mathematical, and
                scientific studies. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 1997</TIMEX>, he requested a leave from his studies, citing the
                need to attend to unspecified "problems" in his home <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. Although the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">university</ENAMEX> denied his request, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shehhi</ENAMEX> left anyway, and consequently was compelled to
                repeat <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first semester</TIMEX> of his studies. In addition to having academic
                difficulties at this time, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shehhi</ENAMEX> appeared to become more extreme in the practice of
                his faith; for example, he specifically avoided <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">restaurants</ENAMEX> that cooked with or
                served <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX>. In late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>, he applied for permission to complete his course work
                in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hamburg</ENAMEX>, a request apparently motivated by his desire to join <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> and
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Binalshibh</ENAMEX>. Just how and when the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of them first met remains unclear, although
                they seemed to know each other already when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shehhi</ENAMEX> relocated to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hamburg</ENAMEX> in early
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Binalshibh</ENAMEX> moved into his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX>.
            
            The transfer to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hamburg</ENAMEX> did not help <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shehhi</ENAMEX>'s academic progress; he was directed by
                the scholarship program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">administrators</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Emirati</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">embassy</ENAMEX> to repeat his second
                semester starting in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 1998</TIMEX>, but back in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bonn</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shehhi</ENAMEX> initially flouted this
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">directive</ENAMEX>, however, and did not reenroll at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bonn</ENAMEX> until the
                following <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January</TIMEX>, barely passing his <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">course</ENAMEX> there. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of July 1999</TIMEX>, he had
                returned to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hamburg</ENAMEX>, applying to study shipbuilding at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Technical University</ENAMEX> and,
                more significantly, residing once again with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Binalshibh</ENAMEX>, in an <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> at
                <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">54</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marienstrasse</ENAMEX>.
            
            After <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shehhi</ENAMEX> moved in with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Binalshibh</ENAMEX>, his evolution toward <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Islamic</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fundamentalism</ENAMEX> became more pronounced. A fellow <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Emirati</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> who came to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hamburg</ENAMEX>
                to visit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shehhi</ENAMEX> noticed he no longer lived as comfortably as before. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shehhi</ENAMEX> now
                occupied an old <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">roommate</ENAMEX>, had no television, and wore inexpensive
                clothes. When asked why he was living so frugally, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shehhi</ENAMEX> responded that he was
                living the way the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prophet</ENAMEX> had lived.
            
            Similarly, when someone asked why he and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> never laughed, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shehhi</ENAMEX> retorted, "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">How</ENAMEX>
                can you laugh when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are dying in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Palestine</ENAMEX>?"
            
            Ziad Jarrah
            Born on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 11, 1975</TIMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mazraa</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lebanon</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ziad Jarrah</ENAMEX> came from an affluent family
                and attended private, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Christian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX>. Like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Binalshibh</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shehhi</ENAMEX>, Jarrah
                aspired to pursue higher education in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 1996</TIMEX>, he and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cousin</ENAMEX>
                enrolled at a junior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">college</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greifswald</ENAMEX>, in northeastern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>. There Jarrah
                met and became intimate with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aysel Senguen</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">daughter</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrants</ENAMEX>, who
                was preparing to study dentistry.
            
            Even with the benefit of hindsight, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jarrah</ENAMEX> hardly seems a likely candidate for
                becoming an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Islamic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">extremist</ENAMEX>. Far from displaying radical beliefs when he first
                moved to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>, he arrived with a reputation for knowing where to find the best
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">discos</ENAMEX> and beaches in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beirut</ENAMEX>, and in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greifswald</ENAMEX> was known to enjoy student parties
                and drinking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">beer</ENAMEX>. Although he continued to share an <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greifswald</ENAMEX> with
                his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cousin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jarrah</ENAMEX> was mostly at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senguen</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Witnesses</ENAMEX> interviewed by
                <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9/11</TIMEX>, however, recall that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jarrah</ENAMEX> started showing signs of
                radicalization <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">as early as the end of 1996</TIMEX>. After returning from a trip home to
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lebanon</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jarrah</ENAMEX> started living more strictly according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Koran</ENAMEX>. He read
                brochures in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Arabic</ENAMEX> about jihad, held forth to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> on the subject of holy war,
                and professed disaffection with his previous life and a desire not to leave the
                world "in a natural way."
            
            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 1997</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jarrah</ENAMEX> abruptly switched his intended course of study from
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dentistry</ENAMEX> to aircraft engineering-at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg</ENAMEX>.
                His motivation for this decision remains unclear. The rationale he expressed to
                Senguen-that he had been interested in aviation since playing with toy <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">airplanes</ENAMEX> as
                a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">child</ENAMEX>-rings somewhat hollow. In any event, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jarrah</ENAMEX> appears already to have had
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hamburg</ENAMEX> contacts by this time, some of whom may have played a role in steering him
                toward <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Islamic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">extremism</ENAMEX>.
            
            Following his move to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hamburg</ENAMEX> that fall, he began visiting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senguen</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greifswald</ENAMEX> on
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">weekends</ENAMEX>, until she moved to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bochum</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one year later</TIMEX> to enroll in
                dental <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>. Around the same time, he began speaking increasingly about religion,
                and his visits to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Senguen</ENAMEX> became less and less frequent. He began criticizing her
                for not being religious enough and for dressing too provocatively. He grew a full
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">beard</ENAMEX> and started praying regularly. He refused to introduce her to his <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hamburg</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> because, he told her, they were religious <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslims</ENAMEX> and her refusal to become
                more observant embarrassed him. At some point in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jarrah</ENAMEX> told <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senguen</ENAMEX> that he
                was planning to wage a jihad because there was no greater honor than to die for
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Allah</ENAMEX>. Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jarrah</ENAMEX>'s transformation generated numerous quarrels, their breakups
                invariably were followed by reconciliation.
            
            Forming a Cell
            In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hamburg</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jarrah</ENAMEX> had a succession of living accommodations, but he apparently never
                resided with his future co-conspirators. It is not clear how and when he became part
                of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX>'s circle. He became particularly friendly with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Binalshibh</ENAMEX> after meeting him
                at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quds</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hamburg</ENAMEX>, which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jarrah</ENAMEX> began attending regularly in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late 1997</TIMEX>.
                The worshippers at this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX> featured an outspoken, flamboyant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Islamist</ENAMEX> named
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mohammed Haydar Zammar</ENAMEX>. A well-known <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">figure</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> (and to German
                and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> intelligence <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 1990s</TIMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zammar</ENAMEX> had fought in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>
                and relished any opportunity to extol the virtues of violent jihad. Indeed, a
                witness has reported hearing <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Zammar</ENAMEX> press <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Binalshibh</ENAMEX> to fulfill his duty to wage
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">jihad</ENAMEX>. Moreover, after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9/11</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zammar</ENAMEX> reportedly took credit for influencing not just
                Binalshibh but the rest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hamburg</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zammar</ENAMEX> encouraged them to
                participate in jihad and even convinced them to go to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>.
            
            Owing to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zammar</ENAMEX>'s persuasion or some other source of inspiration, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Binalshibh</ENAMEX>,
                Shehhi, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jarrah</ENAMEX> eventually prepared themselves to translate their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">extremist</ENAMEX>
                beliefs into action. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late 1999</TIMEX>, they were ready to abandon their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX> lives in
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> in favor of violent jihad. This final stage in their evolution toward
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">embracing Islamist</ENAMEX> extremism did not entirely escape the notice of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> around
                them. The foursome became core <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of a group of radical <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslims</ENAMEX>, often hosting
                sessions at their <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Marienstrasse</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> that involved extremely anti-American
                discussions. Meeting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three to four times a week</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> became something of a
                "sect" whose <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>, according to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participant</ENAMEX> in the meetings, tended to deal
                only with each other.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX>'s rent checks for the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> provide evidence of the importance that the
                apartment assumed as a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, as he would write on them the notation
                "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dar el Ansar</ENAMEX>," or "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">house</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">followers</ENAMEX>."
            
            In addition to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Binalshibh, Shehhi</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jarrah</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> included other
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">extremists</ENAMEX>, some of whom also would attend <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> training <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camps</ENAMEX> and, in some
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">instances</ENAMEX>, would help the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX> hijackers as they executed the plot:
            
                Said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bahaji</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">son</ENAMEX> of a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Moroccan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immigrant</ENAMEX>, was the only <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizen</ENAMEX> in the
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX>. Educated in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Morocco</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bahaji</ENAMEX> returned to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> to study electrical
                    engineering at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg</ENAMEX>. He spent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five months</TIMEX>
                    in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">army</ENAMEX> before obtaining a medical discharge, and lived with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> and
                    Binalshibh at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">54</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marienstrasse</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eight months</TIMEX> between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November 1998 and July</TIMEX>
                    <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>. Described as an insecure <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">follower</ENAMEX> with no personality and with limited
                    knowledge <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">of Islam</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bahaji</ENAMEX> nonetheless professed his readiness to engage in
                    violence. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Binalshibh</ENAMEX> used <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Bahaji</ENAMEX>'s computer for Internet research, as
                    evidenced by documents and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diskettes</ENAMEX> seized by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX> after
                        9/11.
                
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zakariya Essabar</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Moroccan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizen</ENAMEX>, moved to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February 1997</TIMEX> and to
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hamburg</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>, where he studied medical technology. Soon after moving to
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hamburg</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Essabar</ENAMEX> met <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Binalshibh</ENAMEX> and the others through a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Turkish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mosque</ENAMEX>. Essabar
                    turned <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">extremist</ENAMEX> fairly suddenly, probably in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>, and reportedly pressured one
                    acquaintance with physical force to become more religious, grow a beard, and
                    compel his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">wife</ENAMEX> to convert to Islam. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Essabar</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX> were said to have made
                    repeated but unsuccessful efforts to sway him from this lifestyle. Shortly
                    before the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX> attacks, he would travel to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> to communicate the date
                    for the attacks to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX>.
                
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mounir el Motassadeq</ENAMEX>, another <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Moroccan</ENAMEX>, came to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>, moving to
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hamburg</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years later</TIMEX> to study electrical engineering at theTechnical
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University</ENAMEX>. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witness</ENAMEX> has recalled <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Motassadeq</ENAMEX> saying that he would kill his
                    entire family if his religious beliefs demanded it. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Motassadeq</ENAMEX>'s
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">roommates</ENAMEX> recalls him referring to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hitler</ENAMEX> as a "good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX>" and organizing film
                    sessions that included speeches by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Motassadeq</ENAMEX> would help conceal the
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hamburg</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>'s trip to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late 1999</TIMEX>.
                
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abdelghani Mzoudi</ENAMEX>, also a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Moroccan</ENAMEX>, arrived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer of 1993</TIMEX>,
                    after completing university <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX> in physics and chemistry. Mzoudi studied in
                    Dortmund, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bochum</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Muenster</ENAMEX> before moving to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hamburg</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>. Mzoudi
                    described himself as a weak <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Muslim</ENAMEX> when he was home in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Morocco</ENAMEX>, but much more
                    devout when he was back in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hamburg</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 1996</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mzoudi</ENAMEX> and Motassadeq
                    witnessed the execution of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX>'s will.
                
            
            During the course of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> became ever more extreme and secretive,
                speaking only in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Arabic</ENAMEX> to conceal the content of their conversations. 87 When the
                <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> core <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hamburg</ENAMEX> cell left <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> to journey to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> late
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that year</TIMEX>, it seems unlikely that they already knew about the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX>; no
                evidence connects them to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> before that time. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Witnesses</ENAMEX> have attested,
                however, that their pronouncements reflected ample predisposition toward taking some
                action against the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>.
            
            In short, they fit the bill for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bin Ladin, Atef</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX>.
            Going to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> The available evidence indicates that in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Binalshibh</ENAMEX>,
                Shehhi, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jarrah</ENAMEX> decided to fight in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chechnya</ENAMEX> against the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russians</ENAMEX>. According to
                Binalshibh, a chance meeting on a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> caused the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> to travel to
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> instead. An <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Khalid al Masri</ENAMEX> approached <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Binalshibh</ENAMEX> and
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shehhi</ENAMEX> (because they were <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arabs</ENAMEX> with beards, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Binalshibh</ENAMEX> thinks) and struck up a
                conversation about jihad in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chechnya</ENAMEX>. When they later called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Masri</ENAMEX> and expressed
                interest in going to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chechnya</ENAMEX>, he told them to contact <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abu Musab</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Duisburg</ENAMEX>,
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abu Musab</ENAMEX> turned out to be <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mohamedou Ould Slahi</ENAMEX>, a significant <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>
                operative who, even then, was well known to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">German</ENAMEX> intelligence, though
                neither <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> apparently knew he was operating in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late 1999</TIMEX>. When
                telephoned by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Binalshibh</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shehhi, Slahi</ENAMEX> reportedly invited these promising
                recruits to come see him in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Duisburg</ENAMEX>.
            
            Binalshibh, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shehhi</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jarrah</ENAMEX> made the trip. When they arrived, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Slahi</ENAMEX> explained that
                it was difficult to get to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chechnya</ENAMEX> at that time because many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">travelers</ENAMEX> were being
                detained in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Georgia</ENAMEX>. He recommended they go to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> instead, where they could
                train for jihad before traveling onward to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chechnya</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Slahi</ENAMEX> instructed them to obtain
                Pakistani visas and then return to him for further directions on how to reach
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>. Although <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> did not attend the meeting, he joined in the plan with
                the other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>. After obtaining the necessary visas, they received <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Slahi</ENAMEX>'s final
                instructions on how to travel to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Karachi</ENAMEX> and then <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quetta</ENAMEX>, where they were to contact
                someone named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Umar al Masri</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taliban</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX>.
            
            Following <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Slahi</ENAMEX>'s advice, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jarrah</ENAMEX> left <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hamburg</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last week</TIMEX> of
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November 1999</TIMEX>, bound for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Karachi</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shehhi</ENAMEX> left for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> around the same time;
                Binalshibh, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about two weeks later</TIMEX>. Binalshibh remembers that when he arrived at the
                Taliban <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Quetta</ENAMEX>, there was no one named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Umar al Masri</ENAMEX>. The name,
                apparently, was simply a code; a group of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Afghans</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> promptly escorted
                him to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kandahar</ENAMEX>. There <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Binalshibh rejoined Atta</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jarrah</ENAMEX>, who said they already
                had pledged loyalty to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> and urged him to do the same. They also informed
                him that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shehhi</ENAMEX> had pledged as well and had already left for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United Arab</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Emirates</ENAMEX> to prepare for the mission. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Binalshibh</ENAMEX> soon met privately with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>,
                accepted the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX>'s invitation to work under him, and added his own
                pledge to those of his <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hamburg</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX>. By <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this time</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Binalshibh</ENAMEX> claims, he
                assumed he was volunteering for a martyrdom operation.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jarrah</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Binalshibh</ENAMEX> then met with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atef</ENAMEX>, who told them they were about to
                undertake a highly secret mission. As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Binalshibh</ENAMEX> tells it, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atef</ENAMEX> instructed the three
                to return to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> and enroll in flight training. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX>- whom <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> chose to
                lead the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>-met with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> several times to receive additional instructions,
                including a preliminary list of approved targets: the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Trade Center</ENAMEX>, the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Capitol</ENAMEX>.
            
            The new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recruits</ENAMEX> also learned that an individual named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rabia al Makki</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nawaf al</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX>) would be part of the operation.
            
            In retrospect, the speed with which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shehhi, Jarrah</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Binalshibh</ENAMEX> became core
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">9/11</NUMEX> plot-with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> designated its operational <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX>-is remarkable.
                They had not yet met with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> when all this occurred. It is clear, then, that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bin</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ladin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atef</ENAMEX> were very much in charge of the operation. That these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> were
                selected so quickly-before comprehensive testing in the training <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camps</ENAMEX> or in
                operations-demonstrates that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atef</ENAMEX> probably already understood the
                deficiencies of their initial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mihdhar</ENAMEX>. The new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recruits</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Germany</ENAMEX>
                possessed an ideal combination of technical skill and knowledge that the original
                <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX>, veteran <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">fighters</ENAMEX> though they were, lacked. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> and Atef
                wasted no time in assigning the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hamburg</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> to the most ambitious operation yet
                planned by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atef</ENAMEX> also plainly judged that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> was best suited to be the tactical
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commander</ENAMEX> of the operation. Such a quick and critical judgment invites speculation
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about</TIMEX> whether they had already taken <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX>'s measure at some earlier meeting. To be
                sure, some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gaps</ENAMEX> do appear in the record of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX>'s known whereabouts during the
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">preceding years</TIMEX>. One such gap is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February-March 1998</TIMEX>, a period for which there is no
                evidence of his presence in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> and when he conceivably could have been in
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>.
            
            Yet to date, neither <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Binalshibh</ENAMEX>, nor any other <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> figure interrogated
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about the 9/11</TIMEX> plot has claimed that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> or any other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hamburg</ENAMEX> group
                traveled to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> before the trip in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late 1999</TIMEX>.
            While the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> core <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hamburg</ENAMEX> cell <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> were in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>, their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">associates</ENAMEX> back
                in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hamburg</ENAMEX> handled their affairs so that their trip could be kept secret. Motassadeq
                appears to have done the most. He terminated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shehhi</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> lease, telling the
                landlord that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shehhi</ENAMEX> had returned to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAE</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> reasons, and used a power of
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> to pay bills from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shehhi</ENAMEX>'s bank account.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Motassadeq</ENAMEX> also assisted <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jarrah</ENAMEX>, offering to look after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aysel Senguen</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jarrah</ENAMEX>'s
                absence. Said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bahaji</ENAMEX> attended to similar routine matters for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Binalshibh</ENAMEX>,
                thereby helping them remain abroad without drawing attention to their absence.
            
            Preparing for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Operation</ENAMEX>
            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 2000</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jarrah</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Binalshibh</ENAMEX> returned to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hamburg</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jarrah</ENAMEX> arrived
                first, on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 31</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2000.97</NUMEX> According to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Binalshibh</ENAMEX>, he and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> left <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kandahar</ENAMEX>
                together and proceeded <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Karachi</ENAMEX>, where they met <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> and were instructed by
                him on security and on living in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shehhi</ENAMEX> apparently had already
                met with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> before returning to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAE</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> returned to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hamburg</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late February</TIMEX>,
                and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Binalshibh</ENAMEX> arrived shortly thereafter. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shehhi</ENAMEX>'s travels took him to the UAE
                (where he acquired a new passport and a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> visa), <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bahrain</ENAMEX>, and one
                or more other destinations. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shehhi</ENAMEX> also returned to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>, possibly sometime in
                    <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX>.
            
            After leaving <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>, the hijackers made clear efforts to avoid appearing
                radical. Once back in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hamburg</ENAMEX>, they distanced themselves from conspicuous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">extremists</ENAMEX>
                like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zammar</ENAMEX>, whom they knew attracted unwanted attention from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX>.
            
            They also changed their appearance and behavior. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> wore <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Western</ENAMEX> clothing, shaved
                his beard, and no longer attended <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">extremist mosques</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jarrah</ENAMEX> also no longer wore a
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">full beard</TIMEX> and, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Senguen</ENAMEX>, acted much more the way he had when she first
                met him. And when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shehhi</ENAMEX>, while still in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAE</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 2000</TIMEX>, held a belated
                wedding celebration (he actually had been married in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>), a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friend</ENAMEX> of his was
                surprised to see that he had shaved off his beard and was acting like his old self
                    again.
            
            But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jarrah</ENAMEX>'s apparent efforts to appear less radical did not completely conceal his
                transformation from his <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Lebanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, which grew increasingly concerned about his
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fanaticism</ENAMEX>. Soon after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jarrah</ENAMEX> returned to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>, his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> asked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jarrah</ENAMEX>'s
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cousin-a</ENAMEX> close <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">companion</ENAMEX> from boyhood-to intercede. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cousin</ENAMEX>'s ensuing effort to
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">persuade Jarrah</ENAMEX> to depart from "the path he was taking" proved unavailing<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.101</NUMEX>Yet
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jarrah</ENAMEX> clearly differed from the other hijackers in that he maintained much closer
                contact with his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> and continued his intimate relationship with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senguen</ENAMEX>. These
                ties may well have caused him to harbor some doubts about going through with the
                plot, even as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late as the summer of 2001</TIMEX>, as discussed in chapter 7.
            After leaving <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> began researching flight <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> and aviation
                training. In early <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 2000</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ali Abdul Aziz Ali-a</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nephew</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> living in the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAE</ENAMEX> who would become an important facilitator in the plot- used <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Shehhi</ENAMEX>'s credit card
                to order a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">747-400</ENAMEX> flight <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">simulator</ENAMEX> program and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">767</ENAMEX> flight deck
                video, together with attendant literature; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ali</ENAMEX> had all these items shipped to his
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">employer</ENAMEX>'s address. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jarrah</ENAMEX> soon decided that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> were not
                acceptable and that he would have to learn to fly in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. Binalshibh
                also researched flight <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, and in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Netherlands</ENAMEX> he met a flight
                school <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> who recommended flight <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> because they
                were less expensive and required shorter training periods.
            
            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 2000</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX> emailed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX> different <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> flight <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">schools</ENAMEX> on behalf of a small
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> from various <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Arab</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> studying in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> who, while lacking
                prior training, were interested in learning to fly in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Atta</ENAMEX>
                requested information about the cost of the training, potential financing, and
                    accommodations.
            
            Before seeking visas to enter the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shehhi</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jarrah</ENAMEX> obtained
                new passports, each claiming that his old passport had been lost. Presumably they
                were concerned that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pakistani</ENAMEX> visas in their old passports would raise
                suspicions about possible travel to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>. Shehhi obtained his visa on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January</TIMEX>
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18, 2000</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX>, on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 18</TIMEX>; and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jarrah</ENAMEX>, on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 25</TIMEX>.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Binalshibh</ENAMEX>'s visa request was rejected, however, as were his <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> subsequent
                applications. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">105 Binalshibh</ENAMEX> proved unable to obtain a visa, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">victim</ENAMEX> of the
                generalized suspicion that visa <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">applicants</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX>-especially young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> applying
                in another <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Binalshibh</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> applied in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX>)-might join the ranks of
                undocumented <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aliens</ENAMEX> seeking work in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. Before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9/11</TIMEX>, security
                concerns were not a major factor in visa issuance unless the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">applicant</ENAMEX> already was
                on a terrorist watchlist, and none of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> was. Concerns that Binalshibh
                intended to immigrate to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> doomed his chances to participate
                firsthand in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 9/11</TIMEX> attacks. Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Binalshibh</ENAMEX> had to remain behind, he would
                provide critical assistance from abroad to his co-conspirators.
            Once again, the need for travel documents dictated <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>'s plans.
            Travel
            It should by now be apparent how significant travel was in the planning undertaken by
                a terrorist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> as far-flung as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>. The story of the plot includes
                references to dozens of international trips. Operations required travel, as did
                basic communications and the movement of money. Where electronic communications were
                regarded as insecure, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> relied even more heavily on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couriers</ENAMEX>.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abu Zubaydah</ENAMEX> each played key roles in facilitating travel for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX>. In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> had an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> of passports and host <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> issues
                under its security <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committee</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> was located at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kandahar</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX> and was
                managed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atef</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committee</ENAMEX> altered papers, including passports, visas, and
                identification cards.
            
            Moreover, certain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> were charged with organizing passport collection
                schemes to keep the pipeline of fraudulent documents flowing. To this end, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>
                required jihadists to turn in their passports before going to the front lines in
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>. If they were killed, their passports were recycled for use.
            
            The operational mission training course taught <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX> how to forge documents.
                Certain passport alteration methods, which included substituting photos and erasing
                and adding travel <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cachets</ENAMEX>, were also taught. Manuals demonstrating the technique for
                "cleaning" visas were reportedly circulated among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mohamed Atta</ENAMEX> and
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zakariya Essabar</ENAMEX> were reported to have been trained in passport alteration.
            
            The purpose of all this training was twofold: to develop an institutional capacity
                for document forgery and to enable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX> to make necessary adjustments in the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">field</ENAMEX>. It was well-known, for example, that if a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Saudi</ENAMEX> traveled to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> via
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>, then on his return to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX> his passport, bearing a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pakistani</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stamp</ENAMEX>, would be confiscated. So <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX> either erased the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pakistani</ENAMEX> visas from
                their passports or traveled through <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX>, which did not stamp visas directly into
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">passports</ENAMEX>.
            
            A MONEY TRAIL?
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">aides</ENAMEX> did not need a very large sum to finance their planned attack
                on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">plotters</ENAMEX> eventually spent <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">somewhere between $400,000</NUMEX> and
                <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$500,000</NUMEX> to plan and conduct their attack. Consistent with the importance of the
                project, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> funded the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">plotters</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> provided his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX> with nearly all
                the money they needed to travel to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX>, and live. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">plotters</ENAMEX>'
                tradecraft was not especially sophisticated, but it was good enough. They moved,
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stored</ENAMEX>, and spent their money in ordinary ways, easily defeating the detection
                mechanisms in place at the time.
            
            The origin of the funds remains unknown, although we have a general idea of how <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qaeda</ENAMEX> financed itself during the period leading <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to 9/11</NUMEX>.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Financing</ENAMEX>
            As we explained in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">chapter 2</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> did not fund <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> through a personal
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fortune</ENAMEX> and a network of businesses in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sudan</ENAMEX>. Instead, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> relied primarily on
                a fund-raising <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> developed over time. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> now estimates that it cost <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al</ENAMEX>
                Qaeda <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $30 million</NUMEX> per year to sustain its activities before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9/11</TIMEX> and that this
                money was raised almost entirely through donations.
            
            For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many years</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> thought <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> financed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>'s expenses
                through a vast personal inheritance. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> purportedly inherited approximately
                <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$300 million</NUMEX> when his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> died, and was rumored to have had access to these funds
                to wage jihad while in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sudan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> and to secure his leadership position
                in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 2000</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> discovered a different reality:
                <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">roughly</NUMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1970 through 1994</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> received <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $1 million</NUMEX> per year-a
                significant sum, to be sure, but not a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$300 million</NUMEX> fortune that could be used to
                fund jihad.
            
            Then, as part of a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Saudi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> crackdown <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early in the 1990s</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>
                family was forced to find a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">buyer</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Usama</ENAMEX>'s share of the family <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">company</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX>.
                The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Saudi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> subsequently froze the proceeds of the sale. This action had
                the effect of divesting <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> of what otherwise might indeed have been a large
                    <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fortune</ENAMEX>.
            
            Nor were <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>'s assets in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sudan</ENAMEX> a source of money for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>
                lived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sudan</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991 to 1996</TIMEX>, he owned a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">businesses</ENAMEX> and other assets.
                These could not have provided significant income, as most were small or not
                economically viable. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> left in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>, it appears that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Sudanese</ENAMEX>
                government expropriated all his assets: he left <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sudan</ENAMEX> with practically nothing. When
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> arrived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>, he relied on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX> until he was able to
                reinvigorate his fund-raising efforts by drawing on ties to wealthy <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> that he had established during the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Afghan</ENAMEX> war in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1980s</TIMEX>.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Qaeda</ENAMEX> appears to have relied on a core <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of financial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">facilitators</ENAMEX> who raised
                money from a variety of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fund-raisers</ENAMEX>, primarily in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gulf</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> and particularly in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX>.
            
            Some individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX> surely knew, and others did not, the ultimate destination of
                their donations. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Qaeda</ENAMEX> and its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">friends</ENAMEX> took advantage of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Islam</ENAMEX>'s strong calls for
                charitable giving, zakat. These financial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">facilitators</ENAMEX> also appeared to rely heavily
                on certain imams at <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mosques</ENAMEX> who were willing to divert zakat donations to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>'s
                    cause.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Qaeda</ENAMEX> also collected money from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> of corrupt <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">charities</ENAMEX>.
            
            It took <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> approaches to using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">charities</ENAMEX> for fund-raising. One was to rely on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Qaeda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">sympathizers</ENAMEX> in specific foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch offices</ENAMEX> of large, international
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">charities</ENAMEX>-particularly those with lax external oversight and ineffective internal
                controls, such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Haramain Islamic Foundation</ENAMEX>.
            
            Smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">charities</ENAMEX> in various parts of the globe were funded by these large <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gulf</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">charities</ENAMEX> and had <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">employees</ENAMEX> who would siphon the money to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>.
            
            In addition, entire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">charities</ENAMEX>, such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Wafa</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>, may have wittingly
                participated in funneling money to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>. In those cases, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX>
                controlled the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>, including access to bank accounts.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Charities</ENAMEX> were a source of money and also provided significant cover, which enabled
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX> to travel undetected under the guise of working for a humanitarian
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX>.
            It does not appear that any government other than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX> financially supported
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9/11</TIMEX>, although some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">governments</ENAMEX> may have contained <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sympathizers</ENAMEX> who turned a blind eye to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>'s fundraising activities.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX> has long been considered the primary source of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> funding, but we
                have found no evidence that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Saudi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> as an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX> or senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saudi</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> individually funded the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX>. (This conclusion does not exclude
                the likelihood that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">charities</ENAMEX> with significant <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Saudi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> sponsorship diverted
                funds to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>.)<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">122</NUMEX> Still, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> found fertile fund-raising ground in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arabia</ENAMEX>, where extreme religious views are common and charitable giving was both
                essential to the culture and subject to very limited oversight.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Qaeda</ENAMEX> also sought money from wealthy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX> in other <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gulf</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Qaeda</ENAMEX> frequently moved the money it raised by hawala, an informal and ancient
                trust-based system for transferring funds.
            
            In some ways, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> had no choice after its move to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>: <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>,
                the banking system there was antiquated and undependable; and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>, formal banking
                was risky due to the scrutiny that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> received after the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 1998</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">East</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Africa embassy</ENAMEX> bombings, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UN</ENAMEX> resolutions against it and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX>.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> relied on the established hawala <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> operating in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dubai</ENAMEX>,
                and throughout the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Middle East</ENAMEX> to transfer funds efficiently. Hawaladars associated
                with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> may have used <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX> to move and store money, as did various <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fund-raisers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX> outside of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>, but there is little evidence
                that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> or core <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> used <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">banks</ENAMEX> while in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>.
            
            Before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9/11</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> spent funds as quickly as it received them. Actual terrorist
                operations represented a relatively small part of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>'s estimated <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$30 million</NUMEX>
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> operating budget. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Qaeda</ENAMEX> funded salaries for jihadists, training <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camps</ENAMEX>,
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">airfields</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicles</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX>, and the development of training manuals. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>
                provided <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">approximately $10-$20 million</NUMEX> per year to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX> in return for safe
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">haven</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> also may have used money to create alliances with other terrorist
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organizations</ENAMEX>, although it is unlikely that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> was funding an overall jihad
                program. Rather, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> selectively provided startup funds to new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> or money
                for specific terrorist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX>.
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Qaeda</ENAMEX> has been alleged to have used a variety of illegitimate means, particularly
                drug trafficking and conflict <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diamonds</ENAMEX>, to finance itself. While the drug trade was
                a source of income for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taliban</ENAMEX>, it did not serve the same purpose for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>,
                and there is no reliable evidence that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> was involved in or made his money
                through drug trafficking.
            
            Similarly, we have seen no persuasive evidence that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> funded itself by trading
                in <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX> conflict <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diamonds</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">129</NUMEX> There also have been claims that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> financed
                itself through manipulation of the stock market based on its advance knowledge of
                the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX> attacks. Exhaustive investigations by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Securities and Exchange</ENAMEX>
                Commission, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>, and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> have uncovered no evidence that anyone with
                advance knowledge of the attacks profited through securities transactions.
            
            To date, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> has not been able to determine the origin of the money
                used for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 9/11</TIMEX> attacks. Ultimately the question is of little practical
                significance. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Qaeda</ENAMEX> had many avenues of funding. If a particular funding source
                had dried up, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> could have easily tapped a different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> or diverted funds
                from another project to fund an operation that cost <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$400,000-$500,000</NUMEX> over nearly
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</TIMEX>.
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Funding</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">9/11 Plot</ENAMEX>
            As noted above, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">plotters</ENAMEX> spent <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">somewhere between $400,000 and $500,000</NUMEX> to
                plan and conduct their attack. The available evidence indicates that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX> were funded by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>, either through wire transfers or cash provided
                by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX>, which they carried into the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> or deposited in foreign accounts
                and accessed from this <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. Our investigation has uncovered no credible evidence
                that any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> gave the hijackers substantial financial
                assistance. Similarly, we have seen no evidence that any foreign government-or
                foreign government <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX>-supplied any funding.
            
            We have found no evidence that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hamburg</ENAMEX> cell <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atta</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shehhi, Jarrah</ENAMEX>, and
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Binalshibh</ENAMEX>) received funds from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late 1999</TIMEX>. It appears they supported
                themselves. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Binalshibh</ENAMEX>, and another plot facilitator, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mustafa al Hawsawi</ENAMEX>, each
                received money, in some cases perhaps <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as much as $10,000</NUMEX>, to perform their roles in
                the plot.
            
            After the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hamburg</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recruits</ENAMEX> joined the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX> conspiracy, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> began giving them
                money. Our knowledge of the funding during this period, before the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX>
                entered the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, remains murky. According to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hamburg</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> members
                each received <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$5,000</NUMEX> to pay for their return to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> after they
                had been selected to join the plot, and they received additional funds for travel
                from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. Financial transactions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">plotters</ENAMEX> are
                discussed in more detail in chapter 7.
            Requirements for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Successful Attack</ENAMEX>
            As some of the core <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX> prepared to leave for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>'s
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> could have reflected on what they needed to be able to do in order to
                organize and conduct a complex international terrorist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX> to inflict
                catastrophic harm. We believe such a list of requirements would have included 
            
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leaders</ENAMEX> able to evaluate, approve, and supervise the planning and direction of
                    the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX>;
                communications sufficient to enable planning and direction of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX>
                    and those who would be helping them;
                a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> system that could recruit <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX>, vet them, indoctrinate them,
                    and give them necessary training;
                an intelligence effort to gather required information and form assessments of
                    enemy strengths and weaknesses;
                the ability to move <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>; and
                the ability to raise and move the necessary money.
            
            The information we have presented about the development of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX> shows
                how, by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the spring</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer of 2000</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> was able to meet these requirements.
            By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late May 2000</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">operatives</ENAMEX> assigned to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">planes</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operation</ENAMEX> were already in the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United States</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hamburg</ENAMEX> cell <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> would soon arrive.
