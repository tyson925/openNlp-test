                because he changed his mind or because his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> intervened.
            In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 1999</TIMEX>, while still in high school in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hamlan</ENAMEX> became involved
                with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> that gathered periodically to watch jihad propaganda tapes, and was
                encouraged by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mentor</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bandar Marui</ENAMEX> to pursue jihad, especially as practiced
                in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bosnia</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Herzegovina</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Russian</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Afghan</ENAMEX> wars and a book titled <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Gladiator of</ENAMEX>
                Passion. As instructed, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hamlan</ENAMEX> acquired a passport, on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February 15, 2000</TIMEX>, and agreed
                to go to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> after the hajj in mid-March <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>. He and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> travel companions
                obtained <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Pakistani</ENAMEX> visas in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sharjah</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAE</ENAMEX>, and traveled to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Islamabad</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">facilitator Hassan Ghul</ENAMEX> took them to a guesthouse managed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abu Zubaydah</ENAMEX>. Days

            At the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Khaldan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">camp</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hamlan</ENAMEX> received military training <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">courses</ENAMEX>. Upon hearing that the

                they received more training. He also met and proclaimed allegiance to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> at
                this time. Injured during a further training session, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hamlan</ENAMEX> was assigned to guard
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airport</ENAMEX>, where he met future <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hijacker</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ahmed al Nami</ENAMEX> (whose recent laser eye

                indoctrinated the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>'s anti-U.S. position and extolled the virtues of
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">martyrdom</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hamlan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nami</ENAMEX> eventually agreed to approach <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abu Hafs al Mauritani</ENAMEX> about
                participating in a suicide operation. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">The day</TIMEX> after visiting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abu Hafs, Hamlan</ENAMEX> and

                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX>. After taking their passports, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abu Basir</ENAMEX> arranged for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hamlan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nami</ENAMEX> to meet
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> and instructed them to use the following phrase to express their desire to
                become martyrs:"I want to be one of this religion's bricks and glorify this
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">religion</ENAMEX>." The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leader</ENAMEX> accepted both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">applicants</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 2000</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abu Basir</ENAMEX>
                took <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hamlan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nami</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kandahar</ENAMEX> to meet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX>, who impressed on them the high
                expectations for martyrs and instructed them on using coded telephone numbers. He
                returned their passports, which had been altered and now contained forged tourism
                stamps for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Singapore</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Malaysia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Turkey</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> told them to meet with Atef
                before returning to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX>, where they should contact hijacker future 9/11
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hijacker Waleed al Shehri</ENAMEX> for additional documentation. After meeting with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atef</ENAMEX>,
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hamlan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nami</ENAMEX> traveled by <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> and by air to an address <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> had given them
                inTehran, where arrangements were made for them to fly to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Qatar</ENAMEX>. From <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Qatar</ENAMEX> they
                traveled onward to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UAE</ENAMEX> and then to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mecca</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Nami</ENAMEX> contacted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> and received coded

                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">consulate</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jeddah</ENAMEX>, they briefly shared an <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">apartment</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shehri</ENAMEX>, who provided
                them with directions to the consulate and showed them how to fill out the visa
                application. After acquiring visas, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hamlan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nami</ENAMEX> presented their passports to
                Shehri for inspection and returned to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mecca</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nami</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX>, who told them to
                return to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the next day</TIMEX>. Despite instructions to the contrary, Hamlan
                insisted on calling his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> before leaving <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX> because he had begun to
                have second thoughts after acquiring the visa. Told by his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> that their mother
                had fallen ill. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hamlan</ENAMEX> decided not to return to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> even after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nami</ENAMEX> reminded
                him of his allegiance to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> and commitment to complete the suicide mission.
                In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Riyadh</ENAMEX>, he told his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brothers</ENAMEX> that he had been on jihad in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chechnya</ENAMEX>. Fearing that
                they might ask for his passport, he removed the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> visa-as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later</TIMEX> confirmed by
                forensic analysis performed by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Saudi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authorities</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hamlan</ENAMEX> returned to college and
                resumed living with his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>, who confiscated his passport. Thereafter, Hamlan

                declined to permit all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commissioners</ENAMEX> to review these sensitive documents. The

                all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Commissioners</ENAMEX> and designated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>. Except for the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 6, 2001</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PDB</ENAMEX> article,
                the summary could not include verbatim quotations, for example the titles of the

            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>. The information regarding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> was not captioned as a threat. It was part of a
                longer cable whose subject line was "Terrorism: <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Biographical Information on Bin</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ladin Associates</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX>." The cable reported further that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX> himself was
                regularly traveling to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. See <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelligence</ENAMEX> report, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 12, 2001</TIMEX>.
                This was doubted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Renditions Branch</ENAMEX>, which had been looking for KSM
                since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>. It noted, however, that if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">source</ENAMEX> was talking about the "real" <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX>,
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> had both "a significant threat and opportunity to pick him up." See <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cable</ENAMEX>, request additional information on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 26, 2001</TIMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">A month later</TIMEX>, a report
                from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX> indicated that the information regarding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX>'s travel to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX> was current <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">as of the summer of 1998</TIMEX>. It noted further, however, that KSM
                continued his old activities but not specifically the travel to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>.
                Significantly, it confirmed that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">source</ENAMEX> was talking about the "real" <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KSM</ENAMEX>. See

                said that it was generally well known by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer of 2001</TIMEX> that he was planning an
                operation in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roger Cressey</ENAMEX> told us he did not recall seeing this

            The only information that actually referred to a hijacking in this period was a

                The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> conducted an extensive investigation of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> who were stopped
                after being observed taking photographs of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> adjacent <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">buildings</ENAMEX> that contained <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> taking the photographs told the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> that he was taking them for
                a co-worker in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indiana</ENAMEX> who had never been to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> and wanted to see what it
                looked like. The picture taker was in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> to obtain further information
                regarding his pending citizenship application. He had an appointment at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Plaza</ENAMEX>, where the relevant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">INS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> were located. This same <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> houses
                portions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Field Office</ENAMEX>. Before going into the building the
                individual pulled out the camera and took <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> photographs. When the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> attempted
                to contact the co-worker (and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">roommate</ENAMEX>) who had requested some photographs, it was
                determined that he had fled without receiving his last paycheck after learning that
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> had asked his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">employer</ENAMEX> some questions about him. Further investigation
                determined that he was an illegal alien using forged identity documents. Despite two
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> of investigation, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> was unable to find the co-worker or determine his
                true identity. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> closed the investigation on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 9, 2003</TIMEX>, when it concluded
                that it was unable to connect the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>'s activities to terrorism. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matthew</ENAMEX> interview

            The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX> full-field investigations number was a generous calculation that included
                fund-raising investigations. It also counted each individual connected to an
                investigation as a separate full-field investigation. Many of these investigations
                should not have been included, such as the one that related to a dead <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>

                The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> informed us that he was unaware how such internal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> communications

                them. Such messages are routinely not shared in order to protect intelligence
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> and methods. In this case, application of the routine procedure did not
                serve that purpose because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> was aware of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">source</ENAMEX>'s identity as well

                that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> regardless of the caveats. No one who was at the meeting suggested that
                option, however. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOJ</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Inspector General</ENAMEX> interview of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve B.</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sept. 16, 2002</TIMEX>; DOJ

                from the legal limits we discussed in section <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.2</NUMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Attorney General</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 1995</TIMEX>
                procedures concerned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FISA</ENAMEX> information developed in an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> intelligence
                investigation. This, however, was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSA</ENAMEX> information. These particular caveats were the
                result of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX>'s and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSA</ENAMEX>'s overabundance of caution in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December</TIMEX>
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>. During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the millennium</TIMEX> crisis, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Attorney General</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reno</ENAMEX> authorized electronic
                surveillance of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> overseas. Because the searches were not within
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, no <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FISA</ENAMEX> warrant was needed. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reno</ENAMEX> approved the surveillances
                pursuant to section <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Executive Order 12333</ENAMEX> with the proviso that the results
                of these particular surveillances not be shared with criminal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> or
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutors</ENAMEX> without the approval of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office of Intelligence Policy and Review</ENAMEX>.
                Because of the complexity of determining whether particular reporting was the fruit
                of particular surveillances, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSA</ENAMEX> decided to place these caveats on all its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bin</ENAMEX>
                Ladin-related reporting, not just reporting on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">surveillances</ENAMEX> authorized by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reno</ENAMEX>.
                As a result, these caveats were placed on the reports relating to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mihdhar</ENAMEX> even
                though they were not covered by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reno</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 1999</TIMEX> order. See <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOJ</ENAMEX> memo, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Reno</ENAMEX> to

            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX>'s email, however, reflects that she was confusing a broad array of
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">caveats</ENAMEX> and legal barriers to information sharing and rules governing criminal
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>' use of information gathered through intelligence <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX>. There was no
                broad prohibition against sharing information gathered through intelligence channels
                with criminal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>. This type of sharing occurred on a regular basis in the field.
                The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX>'s procedures did not apply to all intelligence gathered regardless of
                collection method or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">source</ENAMEX>. Moreover, once information was properly shared, the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">criminal agent</ENAMEX> could use it for further investigation.
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">81</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> email, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jane to Steve</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSLU Response</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Aug. 29, 2001</TIMEX>." <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jane"</ENAMEX> says she only
                asked whether there was sufficient probable cause to open the matter as a criminal
                case and whether the criminal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> could attend any interview if <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mihdhar</ENAMEX> was found.
                She said the answer she received to both questions was no. She did not ask whether
                the underlying information could have been shared. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jane</ENAMEX> interview ( <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 13, 2004</TIMEX>).
                The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSLU</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> denies advising that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> could not participate in an
                interview and notes that she would not have given such inaccurate advice. The
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> told <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSA</ENAMEX> caveats would not have precluded criminal
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> from joining in any search for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mihdhar</ENAMEX> or from participating in any
                interview. Moreover, she said that she could have gone to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSA</ENAMEX> and obtained a
                waiver of any such caveat because there was no <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FISA</ENAMEX> information involved in this
                case. There are no records of the conversation between "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jane</ENAMEX>" and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX>."
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jane"</ENAMEX> did not copy the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> on her email to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX>, so the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">attorney</ENAMEX> did not
                have an opportunity to confirm or reject the advice "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jane"</ENAMEX> was giving to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX>.
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOJ</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Inspector General</ENAMEX> interview of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sherry S.</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Nov. 7, 2002</TIMEX>. "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jane"</ENAMEX> asked the New
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">York</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> assigned to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mihdhar</ENAMEX> search to sign a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FISA</ENAMEX> acknowledgment form
                indicating the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> understood how he had to treat <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FISA</ENAMEX> information. Because no
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FISA</ENAMEX> information was involved, she should not have required him to sign such a form.
                To the extent she believed, incorrectly, that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Attorney General</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX> procedures
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">applied</ENAMEX> to this situation, there was in fact an exception in place for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>. DOJ

                apparently understood the welter of restrictions to mean, in workday shorthand, that
                any information gathered by intelligence <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> should not be shared with criminal
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>. This was incorrect. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOJ</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Inspector General</ENAMEX> interviews of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jane</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 16, 2003</TIMEX>;

            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">82</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> emails between <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve B. and Jane</ENAMEX>, re: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSLU Response</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Aug. 29, 2001</TIMEX>. While the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> expressed his frustration with the situation to "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jane</ENAMEX>," he made no effort to
                press the matter further by discussing his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concerns</ENAMEX> with either his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supervisor</ENAMEX> or
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chief</ENAMEX> division <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counsel</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>.
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">83</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Attorney General</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ashcroft</ENAMEX> testified to us that this and similar
                information-sharing issues arose from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Attorney General</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reno</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX> guidelines,
                discussed in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">chapter 3</ENAMEX>, and specifically from a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 1995</TIMEX> memorandum of then Deputy
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Attorney General</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jamie Gorelick</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Ashcroft</ENAMEX> testimony, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apr.</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13, 2004</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOJ</ENAMEX> memo,
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gorelick</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">White</ENAMEX>, "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Instructions on Separation of Certain Foreign</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Counterintelligence</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Criminal Investigations</ENAMEX>," <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mar.</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4, 1995</TIMEX>.
            We believe the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Attorney General</ENAMEX>'s testimony does not fairly or accurately reflect the
                significance of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX> documents and their relevance to the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX> discussions.
                Whatever the merits of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 1995</TIMEX> Gorelick memorandum and the subsequent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July</TIMEX>
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Attorney General</ENAMEX> procedures on information sharing, they did not apply to the
                information the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> decided she could not share with the criminal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX>. As
                discussed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX>, the reason "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jane"</ENAMEX> decided she could not share information was
                because the initial information on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mihdhar</ENAMEX> had been analyzed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSA</ENAMEX>. This reason
                was unrelated to either of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX> documents. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gorelick</ENAMEX> memorandum applied to
                two particular criminal cases, neither of which was involved in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the summer 2001</TIMEX>
                information-sharing discussions. As the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> observed in his email, Part A of
                the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX> procedures applied only to information obtained pursuant to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FISA</ENAMEX> warrant.
                None of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mihdhar</ENAMEX> material was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FISA</ENAMEX> information. There was an exemption for the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern District of New York</ENAMEX> from Part B of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX> procedures, so they did not
                apply. Also, the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX> procedures did not govern whether information could be shared
                between intelligence and criminal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>, a separation that the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bureau</ENAMEX> did not begin making formally until long after the procedures were in place.
                The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX> procedures governed only the sharing of information with criminal
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prosecutors</ENAMEX>. Even in that situation, the restriction obliged running the information
                through the OIPR screen. What had happened, as we discussed in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">chapter 3</ENAMEX>, was a
                growing battle within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1990s</TIMEX>, and between parts of
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Justice</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FISA Court</ENAMEX>, over the scope of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OIPR</ENAMEX>'s screening function and the
                propriety of using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FISA</ENAMEX>-derived information in criminal matters. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FISA Court</ENAMEX>'s
                concern with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> sloppiness in its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FISA</ENAMEX> applications also began to take a toll: the
                court began designating itself as the gatekeeper for the sharing of intelligence
                information; the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> was required to separately <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">designate criminal</ENAMEX> and intelligence
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>; and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">court</ENAMEX> banned one supervisory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> from appearing before it. By
                late <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>, these factors had culminated in a set of complex rules and a widening set
                of beliefs-a bureaucratic culture-that discouraged <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> from even seeking to
                share intelligence information. Neither <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Attorney General</ENAMEX> acted to resolve the
                conflicting views within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Justice Department</ENAMEX>. Nor did they challenge the strict
                interpretation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FISA</ENAMEX> statute set forth by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FISA Court</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OIPR</ENAMEX>. Indeed,
                this strict interpretation remained in effect until the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">USA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">PATRIOT Act</ENAMEX> was passed
                after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX>.
            Simply put, there was no legal reason why the information the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analyst</ENAMEX> possessed could
                not have been shared with the criminal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX>. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 27</TIMEX>, "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jane"</ENAMEX> requested the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSA</ENAMEX>'s permission to share the information with the criminal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>, but she intended
                for the information only to help the criminal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> in their ongoing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cole</ENAMEX>
                investigation. She still did not believe they could be involved in the intelligence
                investigation even if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NSA</ENAMEX> permitted the information to be shared. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOJ IG 9/11</ENAMEX>

                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX> that it had approved the passage of the information to the criminal

                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">communication</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> lead, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sept. 10, 2001</TIMEX>.
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">85</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mihdhar</ENAMEX> used their true names to obtain <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">driver</ENAMEX>'s licenses
                and open <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Jersey</ENAMEX> bank accounts. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX> also had a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">car</ENAMEX> registered and had been
                listed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego</ENAMEX> telephone book. Searches of readily available databases
                could have unearthed the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">driver</ENAMEX>'s licenses, the car registration, and the telephone
                listing. A search on the car registration would have unearthed a license check by
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Hackensack</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Police Department</ENAMEX> that would have led to information placing
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX> in the area and placing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mihdhar</ENAMEX> at a local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX> for a week in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early July</TIMEX>
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>. The hijackers actively used the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Jersey</ENAMEX> bank accounts, through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATM</ENAMEX>, debit
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">card</ENAMEX>, and cash transactions, until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 10</TIMEX>. Among other things, they used their
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">debit</ENAMEX> cards to pay for hotel <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX>; and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hazmi</ENAMEX> used his card on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August 27</TIMEX> to purchase
                tickets on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Flight 77</ENAMEX> for himself and his <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">brother</ENAMEX> (and fellow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hijacker</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salem al</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hazmi</ENAMEX>. These transactions could have helped locate them if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> had obtained the
                bank records in time. There would have been no easy means, however, to determine the
                existence of these accounts, and obtaining bank cooperation pre-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX> might have been
                problematic. The most likely means of successfully finding the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> in the short time
                available was one not often used pre-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX> for suspected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorists</ENAMEX>: an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI BOLO</ENAMEX> (be
                on the lookout) combined with a media campaign. This alone might have delayed or
                disrupted the plot, even if the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> had not been physically located before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September</TIMEX>
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>. But this would have been considered only if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> believed that they were
                <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about</NUMEX> to carry out an imminent attack. No one at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>-or any other
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agency</ENAMEX>-believed that at the time. See <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> report, financial spreadsheet re: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX>

                (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 17, 2004</TIMEX>). Because the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> never presented the information to the

                might reject an application for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FISA</ENAMEX> warrant on the grounds that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> were
                attempting to make an end run around the criminal process. Therefore, it was judged
                too risky to seek a criminal warrant unless it was certain that it would be
                approved. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOJ</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Inspector General</ENAMEX> interview of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greg J.</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 9, 2002</TIMEX>. In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX> specifically instructed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minneapolis</ENAMEX> that it could not open a criminal

                command <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stations</ENAMEX> were equipped with manuals containing prescripted announcements
                corresponding to a number of specified emergencies. Once the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX> arrived on the

                were left to its discretion.
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX>. When a notable event occurred, it was standard procedure for the on-duty deputy
                fire safety <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> to make an "advisory" announcement to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tenants</ENAMEX> who were affected

                direct <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tenants</ENAMEX> to stand by for further instructions. The purpose of advisory
                announcements, as opposed to "emergency" announcements (such as to evacuate), was to
                reduce panic. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">PANYNJ interview 7</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 2, 2004</TIMEX>); <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Port Authority</ENAMEX> response to

                For the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">105th</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX> and the condition of the less affected area, see Civilian
                interview <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apr.</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27, 2004</TIMEX>). For the other areas of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 105th</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">88th</TIMEX>, and 89th
                floors, see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> analysis of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">911/PAPD</NUMEX> calls.
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">88</TIMEX>. For the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">callers</ENAMEX>, see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> analysis of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">911/PAPD</NUMEX> calls. There are many
                variables to consider in determining whether, and to what extent, stairwell A was
                actually a viable exit. Knowing that the stairway was initially passable from at
                least the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">91st</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX> down, we can conclude that it was likely open from top to
                bottom, on floors farther removed from the impact. However, in areas near the impact
                zone some doors leading to the stairwell may have jammed. We know that access to
                <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stairway A</ENAMEX> was possible from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least the 81st</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">84th</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floors</ENAMEX>, and from several
                other floors <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between the 84th</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">91st</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floor</ENAMEX>. It is likely that access was possible
                from floors higher up as well. It is not known, however, whether <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">911</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">callers</ENAMEX> had a
                clear path to the stairwell entrance from their locations. Damage caused by the
                impact of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX>, and the resulting smoke and heat, may have prevented some from
                being able to reach the entrance to the staircase; but the stated locations of at
                least some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">callers</ENAMEX> indicate that they were near stairwell A on their floor. Based on
                conditions described by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">civilians</ENAMEX> who descended stairwell A from at or above the
                impact zone, we conclude that stairwell A may have become effectively impassable as
                the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> progressed.

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190</NUMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Incident Command System</ENAMEX> (ICS) is a formalized management structure for
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">command</ENAMEX>, control, and coordination during an emergency response. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICS</ENAMEX> provides a
                means to coordinate the efforts of individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> as they work toward the three
                main priorities of most emergencies-life safety, incident stability, and
                property/environment conservation. Within <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICS</ENAMEX>, incident command is organized into
                <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> major components: the command function, the planning section, the operations
                <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">section</ENAMEX>, the logistics section, and the finance/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> section. When
                multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> or jurisdictions are involved in a response, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICS</ENAMEX> provides for and
                can evolve into a unified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">command</ENAMEX>, with a decisionmaker from each key agency

                who worked above the impact zone had not yet reached his or her <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> and was
                killed below the impact zone, either by falling debris, by the fireballs that

                been killed while in the process of evacuating.
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">201</NUMEX>. Ironically, had the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">towers</ENAMEX> remained up longer, scores more <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> responders
                would have died. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twenty-six</NUMEX> additional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 150</NUMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">firefighters</ENAMEX>-were en route at the time of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">South Tower</ENAMEX>'s collapse, and scores

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">202</NUMEX>. The "advisory" announcement directed by protocol (without the expanded
                instruction for occupants to return to their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">floors</ENAMEX>) would have given greater leeway
                to those who judged, based on a firsthand awareness of conditions on their floors
                (e.g., some could feel heat from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">North Tower</ENAMEX> explosion), that evacuation was
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">warranted</ENAMEX>. In retrospect, occupants would only have had to reach a point below the
                77th floor to be safe.
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">203</NUMEX>. Appended to the directive was a list of different types of emergencies with
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">designated Incident Commanders</ENAMEX>. Terrorist incidents were subdivided according to the
                types of attack. Conventional <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">bomb</ENAMEX> threats were assigned to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYPD</ENAMEX>,
                while <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemical</ENAMEX>, biological, and nuclear attacks designated "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYPD</ENAMEX> or FDNY" as the
                Incident <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Commander</ENAMEX>. The directive noted:"The handling of a threat of a chemical or
                biological release or the use of conventional <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">weapons</ENAMEX> falls to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYPD</ENAMEX>. Dealing
                with the consequences of the explosion or release is the responsibility of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX>.
                The investigation that follows, once the consequences of the event have been

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">206</NUMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX>'s lack of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">command</ENAMEX> and control had some unintended positive
                consequences. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">battalion chief</ENAMEX> was dispatched to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">South Tower</ENAMEX> but instead

                the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">South Tower</ENAMEX> collapsed. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDNY</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> dispatched to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">South Tower</ENAMEX>-where they

                In addition, according to one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESU</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officers</ENAMEX> and one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">firefighters</ENAMEX> in the

                nevertheless failed to evacuate in the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">only 29-minute</TIMEX> period between the collapse of

                viewed as credible. At about the same time, news of the threat was conveyed on the
                air threat conference call. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Secret Service</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelligence Division</ENAMEX> tracked down
                the origin of this threat and, during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</TIMEX>, determined that it had originated in

                their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">witnesses</ENAMEX> on this point to be credible. During <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the afternoon</TIMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 11</TIMEX>
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">leadership</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Secret Service</ENAMEX> was satisfied that the reported threat to
                "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Angel"</ENAMEX> was unfounded.
            At the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> press briefing on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 12</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">spokesperson</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ari Fleischer</ENAMEX>

                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fleischer</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">only weeks later</TIMEX> did he learn-from press reports-that the threat was

                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 16</TIMEX> quoted the claim of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assistant secretary</ENAMEX> for labor at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OSHA</ENAMEX> that
                tests show "it is safe for <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">New Yorkers</ENAMEX> to go back to work in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>'s financial

                however.) The most controversial press release, on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 18</TIMEX>, quoted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Administrator Christine Whitman</ENAMEX> as saying that the air was "safe" to breathe. This

                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Inspector General</ENAMEX> investigated the issuance of these press releases and concluded
                that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> did not have enough data about the range of possible pollutants
                other than <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">asbestos</ENAMEX> to make a judgment, lacked public health benchmarks for
                appropriate levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">asbestos</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pollutants</ENAMEX>, and had imprecise methods for

            We do not have the expertise to examine the scientific accuracy of the pronouncements
                in the press releases. The issue is the subject of pending civil litigation.
            We did examine whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> improperly influenced the content of the press
                releases so that they would intentionally mislead the public. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> press releases
                were coordinated with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samuel Thernstrom</ENAMEX>, associate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> for communications at

                were disputes between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX>'s communications <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coordinator</ENAMEX> regarding the press releases. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> communications <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> said she
                felt extreme pressure from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coordinator</ENAMEX>, and felt that they were no
                longer her press releases. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Inspector General</ENAMEX> interview of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tina Kreisher</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Aug.</TIMEX>
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28, 2002</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coordinator</ENAMEX>, however, told us that these disputes were
                solely concerned with process, not the actual substance of the releases. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samuel</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thernstrom</ENAMEX> interview (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mar.</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31, 2004</TIMEX>). Former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">administrator</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christine Whitman</ENAMEX>
                agreed with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coordinator</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christine Whitman</ENAMEX> interview (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 28, 2004</TIMEX>)
                The documentary evidence supports this claim. Although <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whitman</ENAMEX> told us she spoke
                with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> senior economic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adviser</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawrence Lindsey</ENAMEX> regarding the need to get
                the financial markets open quickly, she denied he pressured her to declare the air
                was safe due to economic expediency. We found no evidence of pressure on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> to say
                the air was safe in order to permit the markets to reopen. Moreover, the most
                controversial release that specifically declared the air safe to breathe was
                released after the markets had already reopened. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> did not have the
                health-based benchmarks needed to assess the extraordinary air quality conditions in
                Lower <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manhattan</ENAMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9/11</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> therefore improvised and
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">applied</ENAMEX> standards developed for other circumstances in order to make pronouncements
                regarding air safety, advising <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Ground Zero</ENAMEX> to use protective gear and
                advising the general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> that the air was safe. Whether those improvisations
                were appropriate is still a subject for medical and scientific debate. See <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EPA</ENAMEX>

                security <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guards</ENAMEX> were paid, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">police</ENAMEX> then escorted the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Saudi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX>
                to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hotel</ENAMEX> where they joined <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> already in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lexington</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark Barnard</ENAMEX> interview
                (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 7, 2004</TIMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> is alleged to have had no record of the flight and denied
                that it occurred, hence contributing to the story of a "phantom flight." This is
                another misunderstanding. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> was initially misinformed about how the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saudis</ENAMEX> got
                to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lexington</ENAMEX> by a local police <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officer</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lexington</ENAMEX> who did not have firsthand
                knowledge of the matter. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bureau</ENAMEX> subsequently learned about the flight. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James M.</ENAMEX>

                follows. Within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days of September 11</TIMEX>, fearing reprisals against <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Saudi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nationals</ENAMEX>,
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rihab Massoud</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">deputy chief</ENAMEX> of mission at the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Saudi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">embassy</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">D.C.</ENAMEX>,
                called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dale Watson</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">assistant director</ENAMEX> for counterterrorism, and asked for
                help in getting some of its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">citizens</ENAMEX> out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rihab Massoud</ENAMEX> interview
                (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 11, 2004</TIMEX>). At about the same time, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Rolince</ENAMEX>, chief of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>'s
                international terrorism operations section, also heard from an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> in
                <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Newark</ENAMEX> about a proposed flight of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saudis</ENAMEX> out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Rolince</ENAMEX>
                interview (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 9, 2004</TIMEX>). We believe this was the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Saudi</ENAMEX> deputy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">defense minister</ENAMEX>'s
                flight. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rolince</ENAMEX> says he told the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Newark</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">official</ENAMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saudis</ENAMEX> should not be
                allowed to leave without having the names on their passports matched to their faces,
                and their names run through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> case records to see whether they had surfaced
                before. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rolince</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Watson</ENAMEX> briefed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Mueller</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">director</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>, about
                the issue and how they were handling it. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX> played a role as well
                in flights involving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the royal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>. State
                coordinated with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> to allow screening by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> of flights with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saudi</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nationals</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX>. There is no evidence that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State</ENAMEX> tried to limit the screening.

                interview (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 14, 2004</TIMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> effectively approved the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Saudi</ENAMEX> flights at the
                level of a section chief. Having an opportunity to check the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saudis</ENAMEX> was useful to
                the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>. This was because the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> did not, and does not, routinely run
                checks on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foreigners</ENAMEX> who are leaving the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. This procedure was
                convenient to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>, as the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Saudis</ENAMEX> who wished to leave in this way would gather
                and present themselves for record checks and interviews, an opportunity that would
                not be available if they simply left on regularly scheduled commercial flights.
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>. These flights were screened by law enforcement <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">officials</ENAMEX>, primarily the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>. For
                example, one flight, the so-called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> flight, departed the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> on
                <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 20</TIMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX>, most of them <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Usama Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>.
                Screening of this flight was directed by an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baltimore Field Office</ENAMEX>
                who was also a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot</ENAMEX>. This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX>, coordinating with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX>, sent an
                electronic communication to each of the field <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">offices</ENAMEX> through which the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX>
                flight was scheduled to pass, including the proposed flight manifest and directing
                what screening should occur. He also monitored the flight as it moved around the
                country-from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. Louis</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Orlando</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dulles</ENAMEX>, and to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Logan</ENAMEX>-correcting for any changes in itinerary to make sure there was no lapse in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>
                screening at these locations. Again, each of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">airports</ENAMEX> through which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bin</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ladin</ENAMEX> flight passed was open, and no special restrictions were lifted to accommodate
                its passage. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James C. interview</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 3, 2004</TIMEX>).
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> flight and other flights we examined were screened in accordance with
                policies set by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">headquarters</ENAMEX> and coordinated through working-level interagency
                processes. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Rolince</ENAMEX> interview (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 9, 2004</TIMEX>). Although most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX>
                were not interviewed, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> flight were interviewed
                by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>. Many were asked detailed questions. None of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">passengers</ENAMEX> stated that
                they had any recent contact with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Usama Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> or knew anything about terrorist
                activity. See, e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> report of investigation, interview of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mohammed Saleh Bin</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laden</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sept. 21, 2001</TIMEX>. As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Clarke</ENAMEX> noted, long before <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/11</NUMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> was
                following <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bin Ladin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> closely. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard</ENAMEX>

                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> of preliminary investigations by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>, but both their cases had been
                closed, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999 and March 2001</TIMEX>, respectively, because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> had uncovered no
                derogatory information on either <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> linking them to terrorist activity. Their
                cases remained closed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">as of 9/11</TIMEX>, were not reopened before they departed the country
                on this flight, and have not been reopened since. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> electronic communication,

                Defense. It stated that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DCI</ENAMEX> would define what analytical resources he would
                transfer from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CTC</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TTIC</ENAMEX> no later than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 1, 2004</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DCI Tenet</ENAMEX> subsequently
                told us that he decided that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TTIC</ENAMEX> would have primary responsibility for terrorism
                analysis but that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense Intelligence Agency</ENAMEX> would grow their own
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TTIC</ENAMEX> will have tasking authority over terrorism <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">analysts</ENAMEX> in other
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intelligence</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>, although there will need to be a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> to supervise

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> prepared statement, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mar.</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23, 2004</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p. 20</ENAMEX>.
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. In this conception, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCTC</ENAMEX> should plan actions, assigning responsibilities for
                operational direction and execution to other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>. It would be built on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TTIC</ENAMEX> and
                would be supported by the intelligence <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TTIC</ENAMEX> is now. Whichever route is
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chosen</ENAMEX>, the scarce analytical resources now dispersed amongTTIC, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelligence Agency</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joint Interagency Task Force-Combatting Terrorism</ENAMEX> (JITF-CT),
                and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DCI</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Counterterrorist Center</ENAMEX> (CTC) should be concentrated more effectively
                than they are now. 
             The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DCI</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Counterterrorist Center</ENAMEX> would become a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX>, to handle the direction
                and execution of tasks assigned to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>. It could have detailees from other
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agencies</ENAMEX>, as it does now, to perform this operational mission. It would yield much
                of the broader, strategic analytic duties and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCTC</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CTC</ENAMEX> would
                rely on the restructured <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> (discussed in section <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13.2</NUMEX>) to organize, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX>, and
                equip its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX>. 
             Similarly, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Counterterrorism Division</ENAMEX> would remain, as now, the operational
                arm of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bureau</ENAMEX> to combat terrorism. As it does now, it would work with other
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> in carrying out these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">missions</ENAMEX>, retaining the JTTF structure now in place.
                The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Counterterrorism Division</ENAMEX> would rely on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office of Intelligence</ENAMEX> to
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">train</ENAMEX> and equip its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">personnel</ENAMEX>, helping to process and report the information
                gathered in the field. 
             The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense Department</ENAMEX>'s unified commands-SOCOM, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NORTHCOM</ENAMEX>, and CENTCOM-would be the
                joint operational <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> taking on DOD tasks. Much of the excellent analytical
                talent that has been assembled in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense Intelligence Agency</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JITF-CT</ENAMEX> should
                merge into the planned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCTC</ENAMEX>. 
             The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Homeland Security</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Directorate</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Information Analysis</ENAMEX> and
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Infrastructure Protection</ENAMEX> should retain its core duties, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCTC</ENAMEX> should have
                the ultimate responsibility for producing net assessments that utilize Homeland
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Security</ENAMEX>'s analysis of domestic vulnerabilities and integrate all-source analysis of
                foreign intelligence about the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">terrorist enemy</ENAMEX>.
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX>'s counterterrorism <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> would be a critical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participant</ENAMEX> in the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCTC</ENAMEX>'s work, taking the lead in directing the execution of the counterterrorism
                foreign policy mission. The proposed <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">National Counterterrorism Center</ENAMEX> should offer
                one-stop shopping to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> with counterterrorism and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">homeland</ENAMEX> security
                responsibilities. That is, it should be an authoritative reference base on the
                transnational terrorist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>: their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>, goals, strategies,
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">capabilities</ENAMEX>, networks of contacts and support, the context in which they operate,
                and their characteristic habits across the life cycle of operations-recruitment,
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">reconnaissance</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX> selection, logistics, and travel. For example, this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center</ENAMEX>
                would offer an integrated depiction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al Qaeda</ENAMEX> or Hezbollah worldwide,
                overseas, and in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCTC</ENAMEX> will not eliminate the need for the
                executive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">departments</ENAMEX> to have their own analytic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX>. But it would enable
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agency</ENAMEX>-based analytic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> to become smaller and more efficient. In particular, it
                would make it possible for these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>-based analytic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> to concentrate on
                analysis that is tailored to their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX>'s specific responsibilities.
            A useful analogy is in military intelligence. There, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense Intelligence Agency</ENAMEX>
                and the service production <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX> (like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Army</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Ground Intelligence</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center</ENAMEX>) are the institutional memory and reference source for enemy order of battle,
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enemy organization</ENAMEX>, and enemy equipment. Yet the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joint Staff</ENAMEX> and all the theater
                commands still have their own <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">J-2s</ENAMEX>. They draw on the information they need,
                <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tailoring</ENAMEX> and applying it to their operational needs. As they learn more from their
                tactical operations, they pass intelligence of enduring value back up to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense</ENAMEX>
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intelligence Agency</ENAMEX> and the services so it can be evaluated, form part of the
                institutional memory, and help guide future collection.
            In our proposal, that reservoir of institutional memory about terrorist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX>
                would function for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">government</ENAMEX> as a whole, and would be in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCTC</ENAMEX>.
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCTC</ENAMEX> would thus help coordinate the operational side of these
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agencies</ENAMEX>, like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Counterterrorism Division</ENAMEX>. The intelligence side of these
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agencies</ENAMEX>, such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office of Intelligence</ENAMEX>, would be overseen by the
                <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Intelligence</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Director</ENAMEX> we recommend later in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chapter</ENAMEX>.
