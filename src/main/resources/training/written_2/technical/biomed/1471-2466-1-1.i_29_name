        Since the beginning of the acquired immunodeficiency
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">syndrome</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX>) epidemic, pulmonary complications have been
        major causes of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">morbidity</ENAMEX> and mortality in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
        human immunodeficiency virus (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX>) infection [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . In
        addition to the common <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pulmonary diseases</ENAMEX> affecting
        immunocompetent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV seropositive</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> are
        prone to other infectious and noninfectious complications.
        The types of pulmonary complications that develop depend on
        the degree of immunosuppression, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> transmission category,
        and geographic location. Antiretroviral therapy and 
        Pneumocystis <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">carinii pneumonia</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCP</ENAMEX>)
        prophylaxis have improved the clinical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">course</ENAMEX> and outcome
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV-infected</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. However, pulmonary complications,
        including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCP</ENAMEX>, have remained common [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] .
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pulmonary Complications</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intensive Care Unit</ENAMEX>
        Support, and <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Prognostic Factors of Hospitalized Patients</ENAMEX>
        With <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> (PIP) Study is a single-center, prospective
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">observational</ENAMEX> study designed to describe the types of
        pulmonary complications and the role of critical care
        support and to determine the prognostic factors of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hospitalized HIV-infected</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>. Knowledge of the types of
        pulmonary complications in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> infection will
        help clinicians to develop better diagnostic and
        therapeutic approaches. This article describes the
        nonbacterial pulmonary complications that were detected at
        hospital admission and during hospitalization of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">599</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Material and Methods
        This prospective, observational study included <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,225</NUMEX>
        consecutive hospital admissions of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">599</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX>
        infection. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were identified from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>'s
        computer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> and admission logbooks and by contacting
        the case <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">manager</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> 17 years
        or older with confirmed <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> infection were included in the
        study. All the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were treated at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University</ENAMEX>
        Medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jacksonville</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX>, during the 3 years
        from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 1, 1995, through March 31, 1998</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University</ENAMEX>
        Medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center</ENAMEX> is a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">528</NUMEX>-bed, teaching, inner-city <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">affiliated</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Florida</ENAMEX>. The study was
        approved by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institutional Review Board</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>,
        which waived the need for informed consent.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> were collected on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX>, sex, race, exposure category
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> infection, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> +lymphocyte count, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">APACHE</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acute</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation</ENAMEX>) II score,
        hospital stay, and in-hospital mortality. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigator</ENAMEX>,
        a pulmonologist, reviewed all chest radiographs. All
        nonbacterial pulmonary complications that were diagnosed
        during <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>' hospital stays were noted. The
        microbiologic, cytologic, and histologic findings of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">expectorated</ENAMEX> and induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sputum</ENAMEX> and other samples obtained
        by bronchoscopy, mediastinoscopy, and thoracotomy were
        noted.
        Only confirmed pulmonary complications were included. 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> carinii , mycobacterial, fungal,
        and viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pulmonary infections</ENAMEX> were diagnosed by
        identifying the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> in stains or cultures of sputum,
        bronchial washing, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), and lung
        tissue. Multiple episodes of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCP</ENAMEX> and mycobacterial
        infections were defined by identifying the same <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> on
        different admissions of the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>. Fungus ball was
        diagnosed by the typical chest radiographic finding of a
        fungus ball in a preexisting cavity. Acute asthma
        exacerbation, acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pulmonary disease</ENAMEX> (COPD), and cardiogenic pulmonary edema
        were diagnosed by physical findings in the appropriate
        clinical setting. Pulmonary embolism was documented by
        pulmonary angiogram or spiral computed tomography of the
        chest. Pulmonary contusion was diagnosed by the development
        of radiographic densities of the chest following chest
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">trauma</ENAMEX>. Pulmonary sarcoidosis and malignancies were
        diagnosed by bronchoscopy. In <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with 
        Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB)
        infection, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibiotic</ENAMEX> susceptibility test results were
        reviewed.
        For the purpose of this study, multiple hospital
        admissions of the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> were analyzed independently
        of each other. StatView <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.0</NUMEX> computer software (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institute Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cary</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NC</ENAMEX>) was used for statistical
        analysis. All means were expressed with their standard
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">deviations</ENAMEX> (SDs). Comparisons between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> were made by
        using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Student</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mann</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whitney U</ENAMEX>, Î<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">§ 2</NUMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fisher</ENAMEX>
        exact tests. 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> values < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX> were considered
        significant. Continuity correction was used to determine
        the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> values of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Î§ 2tests.</ENAMEX> The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sensitivity</ENAMEX>, specificity, and positive and negative
        predictive values of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) for the
        diagnosis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCP</ENAMEX> were calculated by using the normal high
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">serum</ENAMEX> LDH level for our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">210</NUMEX> units/mL as a
        cutoff point.

        Discussion
        This study describes the nonbacterial pulmonary
        complications detected among <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,225</NUMEX> hospital admissions of
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">599</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> infection. The study population
        consisted predominantly of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African Americans</ENAMEX>, with a
        significant number of heterosexual and unidentified
        transmission categories. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX> transmission category
        influences the types of pulmonary complications that
        develop in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>. Because homosexuality and
        injection <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> use are the major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX> transmission
        categories in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX>, the findings in our study
        may not apply to other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCP</ENAMEX> was the most common nonbacterial pulmonary
        complication caused by a single <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> in our study.
        Despite its decline as a result of widespread
        antiretroviral therapy and chemoprophylaxis, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCP</ENAMEX> has
        remained a common complication in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX>
        infection [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3</NUMEX> ] . In a prospective <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">multicenter</ENAMEX> study of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV seropositive</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">79%</NUMEX> of those with a CD4
        +lymphocyte count < 200/Î¼L receiving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCP</ENAMEX>
        chemoprophylaxis, the rate of <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> episode <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCP</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3.3</NUMEX> per
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>-years [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . Although actual data were not
        available, high rates of noncompliance with and lack of
        access to antiretroviral therapy and chemoprophylaxis were
        likely in our study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, which included a
        significant number of medically underserved patients
        without perceived risk for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>.
        Previous studies addressed the need for simpler tests
        and strategies to identify <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with a high probability
        of having <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCP</ENAMEX> to initiate either empiric treatment or
        aggressive investigation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6</NUMEX> ] . These studies reported
        that an increase in LDH value had variable specificity and
        sensitivity for the diagnosis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCP</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX> seropositive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> are at increased risk for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCP</ENAMEX> when their CD4
        +lymphocyte count is < <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">200/Î¼L</TIMEX>. Similar to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">multicenter</ENAMEX> study by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pulmonary Complications of HIV</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Infection Study Group</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] , <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">94%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCP</ENAMEX>
        had a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> +lymphocyte count < <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">200/Î¼L</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PIP</ENAMEX> study.
        The classic chest radiographic findings of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCP</ENAMEX> include bilateral diffuse opacities [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . However,
        some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> present with unusual chest radiographic
        findings [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8</NUMEX> ] . In a multicenter study from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX>, the in-hospital mortality rate of hospitalized
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cytologically</ENAMEX> confirmed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCP</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14%</NUMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] .
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PIP</ENAMEX> study showed that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCP</ENAMEX> is unusual in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
        normal <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> +lymphocyte count and serum LDH concentration,
        can present with atypical chest radiographic findings, can
        be diagnosed from induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sputum</ENAMEX> in most of the cases, and
        is associated with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11%</NUMEX> mortality.
        In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PIP</ENAMEX> study of predominantly <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African-American</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">nearly 50%</NUMEX> of the MTB isolates had a negative AFB
        smear, none of the isolates was isoniazid resistant, and
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX> of the admissions with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTB</ENAMEX> respiratory infection had no
        infiltrate on the initial chest radiograph. HIV-infected
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> are highly susceptible to contracting
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tuberculous</ENAMEX> infection and are prone to rapid evolution of
        active disease [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . The rate of tuberculosis is high in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African Americans</ENAMEX> and in injection <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] .
        Although the prevalence of a positive AFB smear in patients
        with pulmonary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTB</ENAMEX> is approximately the same in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV-infected</ENAMEX> and noninfected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>, it may decline in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">advanced HIV</ENAMEX>-mediated immunosuppression [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . A previous
        study of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">133</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV-infected</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> with pulmonary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTB</ENAMEX> showed
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14%</NUMEX> of them had a normal chest radiograph [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] .
        The isolation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAC</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAL</ENAMEX> or sputum does not
        distinguish between disease and colonization. Prospective
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cohort</ENAMEX> studies have shown that in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25% to 35%</NUMEX> of patients
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> infection disseminated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAC</ENAMEX> disease eventually
        develops [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15</NUMEX> ] . The risk of disseminated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAC</ENAMEX> disease
        depends on the severity of the immunodeficiency. In the PIP
        study, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAC</ENAMEX> respiratory isolates had a low CD4
        +lymphocyte count, and the majority of them had evidence of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disseminated disease</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV</ENAMEX> is the most common opportunistic viral infection in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV</ENAMEX> was isolated from
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAL</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PIP</ENAMEX> study, its isolation does
        not distinguish between infection and colonization. Fungal
        infections are common in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> infection.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV-infected</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> residing in areas endemic for 
        Histoplasma capsulatum are at
        increased risk for 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX> capsulatum infection [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Histoplasmosis</ENAMEX> is uncommon in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> from areas in
        which 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX> capsulatum is nonendemic and
        usually represents <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">reactivation</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PIP</ENAMEX> study was
        performed in an area in which 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX> capsulatum is nonendemic, and there
        was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 1</NUMEX> case of pulmonary histoplasmosis in a patient
        who had resided in an area endemic for 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX> capsulatum . Although the lungs are
        the primary site of cryptococcal infection, pulmonary
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> was believed to be uncommon in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> ] . No <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pulmonary cryptococcal disease</ENAMEX> was diagnosed in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PIP</ENAMEX> study. However, a recent review of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</NUMEX> autopsies of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV-infected</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> from the same <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX> showed
        cryptococcal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pneumonia</ENAMEX> to be as frequent as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCP</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ]
        .
        In <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> infection, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 20%</NUMEX> are expected
        to develop a malignancy [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PIP</ENAMEX> study population
        is predominantly <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African American</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Blacks</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX>
        infection have a lower risk of cancer developing than
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nonblacks</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . Kaposi sarcoma and non-<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Hodgkin</ENAMEX> lymphoma
        are the most common malignancies, and they are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epidemiologically</ENAMEX> linked to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>. Kaposi sarcoma has been
        reported in all <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> risk <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. However, it occurs
        predominantly in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homosexual</ENAMEX> and bisexual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . In
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PIP</ENAMEX> study, homosexuality was not a <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">predominant HIV</ENAMEX> risk
        factor, and pulmonary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kaposi</ENAMEX> sarcoma was diagnosed in only
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>.
        Conflicting evidence links lung cancer with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX>
        infection. At the beginning of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> epidemic, few cases
        of bronchogenic carcinoma were reported [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 25</NUMEX> ] . Using
        the registry of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bellevue Hospital</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York City</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chan</ENAMEX> et
        al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] showed no link between lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX>
        infection. Another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>-based study from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francisco</ENAMEX> showed no excess of lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> among a cohort of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Italian Cooperative Study Group</ENAMEX>
        described <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> cases of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX>-associated lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tobacco</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">smokers</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] . More recent studies have indicated
        an increase in incidence of primary lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> in patients
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> infection [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 29</NUMEX> ] . Although there was no case
        of adenocarcinoma in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PIP</ENAMEX> study, it is the predominant
        cell type of bronchogenic carcinoma in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX>
        infection [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 26 30</NUMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pulmonary Complications of HIV</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Infection Study Group</ENAMEX> has shown upper respiratory infection
        and bronchitis to be common in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> infection
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . Because the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PIP</ENAMEX> study included only hospitalized
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, minor respiratory problems were likely to have
        been ignored.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PIP</ENAMEX> study has several limitations. Some important
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>, such as smoking history and the use of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chemoprophylaxis</ENAMEX> and antiretroviral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>, were not
        collected. No attempt was made to identify <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
        pulmonary <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hypertension</ENAMEX>. The diagnostic approaches varied
        according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>' primary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX>. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigator</ENAMEX>'s unblinded review of chest radiographs may
        have introduced biases into the study. Diagnostic
        fiberoptic bronchoscopy was performed in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 69</NUMEX> hospital
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">admissions</ENAMEX>, and thoracotomy and mediastinoscopy were rarely
        required. This approach may have led to underdiagnosis of
        some of the pulmonary complications. Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAC</ENAMEX> and CMV
        were isolated from the sputum and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAL</ENAMEX> of many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, the
        presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> could not be ascertained because
        tissues were not available for examination. Because the PIP
        study was started before highly active antiretroviral
        treatment was introduced, the findings may not apply
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">now</TIMEX>.
      
      
        Conclusions
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PIP</ENAMEX> study describes the nonbacterial pulmonary
        complications in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,225</NUMEX> hospital admissions of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">599</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> infection. The present data confirm previously
        described findings addressing these complications [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3 4 5</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7</NUMEX> ] , [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12 13 14 15 22</NUMEX> ] . With the advent of
        antiretroviral therapy and chemoprophylaxis against some of
        the opportunistic infections, the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">morbidity</ENAMEX> and mortality
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> infection have declined in the last
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decade</TIMEX>. The study showed that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCP</ENAMEX> is still a frequent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">complication</ENAMEX>, despite the availability of chemoprophylaxis.
        Although pulmonary tissue involvement is not confirmed,
        most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAC</ENAMEX> isolated from their sputum or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAL</ENAMEX> have disseminated disease. These findings suggest the
        need for more effective preventive measures in similar
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient populations</ENAMEX>. The application of highly active
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">antiretroviral</ENAMEX> treatment and the development of more
        effective chemoprophylaxis against opportunistic infections
        are likely to be associated with changes in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">types</ENAMEX> and
        severity of pulmonary complications that we see in these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. The pulmonary complications are also likely to
        vary according to geographic locations, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> risk factor,
        and severity of immunosuppression. To keep up with these
        changes and variations, we must continue to monitor and to
        describe the pulmonary complications that develop in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HIV</ENAMEX> infection.
