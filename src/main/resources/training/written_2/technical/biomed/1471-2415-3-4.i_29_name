        The excimer laser <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ablation</ENAMEX> is currently widely used
        primarily to correct refractive errors by altering the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">anterior</ENAMEX> curvature of the cornea. Due to its potential for
        accurate ablation of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">anterior stromal corneal lesions</ENAMEX> its
        initial clinical utilization was removal of diseased
        corneal tissue in a procedure called photo therapeutic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">keratectomy</ENAMEX> (PTK). In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1985</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Serdareviz et al</ENAMEX> proposed the
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> therapeutic use of the excimer laser to treat an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">experimental Candida</ENAMEX> infectious keratitis [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . Despite
        the lack of controlled clinical trials comparing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTK</ENAMEX> with
        other treatment modalities such as superficial keratectomy
        or lamellar keratoplasty, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US Food and Drug</ENAMEX>
        Administration (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX>) identified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTK</ENAMEX> as an alternative
        therapeutic approach for the treatment of superficial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">corneal</ENAMEX> and epithelial membrane dystrophies, irregular
        corneal surfaces and corneal scars and opacities.
        The major inherent obstacle of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTK</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> of
        corneal surface irregularities is that through
        photoablation these irregularities are reproduced deeper
        within the stroma.
        Masking techniques refer to photorefractive procedures
        utilizing various masking means or so called modulators to
        protect flatter corneal areas while steeper areas are
        excised with the excimer laser.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kornmehl et al</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] have shown that an ideal masking
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> should have moderate viscosity (between that of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">saline</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX> carboxymethylcellulose) and concluded that
        very viscous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fluids</ENAMEX> would not cover irregular surfaces
        uniformly whereas <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fluids</ENAMEX> of inadequate viscosity would run
        off quickly exposing both peaks and valleys thus resulting
        in irregular surfaces after ablation.
        Numerous previous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> have used different
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">masking</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">methylcellulose</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4 5 6</NUMEX> ] and sodium
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hyaluronate</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 7 8</NUMEX> ] at various concentrations or
        performed transepithelial (so that the epithelium acts as a
        natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">masking agent</ENAMEX>) treatments [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6 9 10</NUMEX> ] and reported
        the beneficial effect of masked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTK</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fasano et al</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ]
        reported that the ideal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">masking agent</ENAMEX> should have the same
        ablation rate to that of the cornea, be biocompatible and
        adhere well to the cornea.
        These properties have been met with the use of collagen
        solutions as modulators. Their applicability as masking
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> for corneal photoablation was examined in
        experimental models of animal and cadaver eyes (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scott et</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Collagen</ENAMEX> modulator <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fluids</ENAMEX> for use during photoablation
        keratectomy: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARVO</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Margaritis et al. Properties</ENAMEX> of a
        new <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> component gel material as an aid in PRK corneal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">remodeling: ARVO 1994</ENAMEX>) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12 13</NUMEX> ] as well as in limited
        clinical trials of partially sighted eyes (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pallikaris et</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al</ENAMEX>: Photoablated lenticular modulator PALM technique: A
        report of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> cases: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ARVO 1998</ENAMEX>) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15</NUMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Photo-Ablatable Lenticular Modulator</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PALM</ENAMEX>) technique
        refers to the use of a modified collagen gel solution for
        the photorefractive correction of corneal surface
        irregularities [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">PALM gel</ENAMEX> similarly to other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">collagen</ENAMEX> modulators [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13 15</NUMEX> ] is thermo reversible. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gel</ENAMEX> is in liquid state when heated to solidify to a firm
        gel as its temperature lowers. Its use for masking purposes
        requires its application onto the corneal stoma at a
        temperature of <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">49°C</NUMEX> where it can be molded to form a stable
        lenticule that serves as the final masking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX>.
        At temperatures of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40°</NUMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53°C</TIMEX>, the collagen individual
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fibril</ENAMEX> bonds are broken and the collagen denatures to its
        parent gelatinous form. When the tissue temperature drops
        to below <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40°C</TIMEX>, these bonds can reunite with possible
        rearrangement of the matrix but without any cellular damage
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . Under this consideration the thermal contact of
        the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">49°C</NUMEX> preheated <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">PALM gel</ENAMEX> onto the bare corneal stroma
        for the in situ molding of the lenticule, would not be
        expected to induce any irreversible changes of the corneal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">collagen</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX>. However its sequential use as masking
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> for PTK could affect the laser-tissue interaction and
        probably the corneal healing response to irradiation.
        In the current study we examined the possible
        implication of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">PALM</ENAMEX> gel when used as described above,
        to the corneal wound healing on rabbit corneas.
        We examined the reepithelization process of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> rabbit
        eyes after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTK</ENAMEX> through <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">PALM</ENAMEX> gel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lenticules</ENAMEX> formed in situ.
        We used a moving slit delivery system in a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> mm ablation
        zone confined by means of a metal iris diaphragm. An equal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> of rabbit eyes received conventional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTK</ENAMEX> of the same
        depth and treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">zone</ENAMEX> and served as control.
      
      
        Methods
        
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">PALM gel</ENAMEX> as a masking agent
          The gel used, as modulator is a soluble mixture of
          purified type A gelatin from porcine skin and a
          polysaccharide, type III carrageenan <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> in nanopure water
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . Both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">components</ENAMEX> are commercially available for
          laboratory use (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma Chemical Co</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">St Louis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mo</ENAMEX>).
          Being thermoreversible, the gel can be stored at room
          temperature in solid form. When heated to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">49°C</TIMEX> it
          liquefies to a high viscosity fluid that solidifies
          within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> when exposed to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> temperature. When
          still in liquid form the gel can be molded by means of a
          rigid contact lens to form a stable lenticule that its
          upper surface will reproduce the inner surface of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">molding lens</ENAMEX>.
          If the lenticule is molded in situ onto the cornea its
          bottom surface will fill any corneal surface
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">irregularity</ENAMEX>. As shown by testing on freshly excised
          porcine corneas (fig. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) the mixture for the preparation
          of the gel is conditioned so that its solid form to have
          the same ablation to that of the cornea [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . The full
          removal of the lenticule with photoablation in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTK</ENAMEX> mode
          would be expected to reproduce the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lenticule</ENAMEX>'s upper
          surface onto the surface of the cornea. Selecting the
          appropriate inner radius of curvature of the molding
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">lens</ENAMEX>, the upper surface of the formed lenticule can be of
          variable curvature. Instillation of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100 μm</NUMEX> of the
          preheated liquid solution [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] on the corneal surface
          requires <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4 minutes</TIMEX> for the lenticule to acquire the
          mechanical stiffness required to withstand the stress
          induced by the lens removal, at room temperature of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25°C</TIMEX>.
          After <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this time</TIMEX> the lens mold is removed and the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lenticule</ENAMEX> is ablated through with irradiation in PTK
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mode</ENAMEX>. An effective amount of fluorescein in the lenticule
          mixture provides the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">surgeon</ENAMEX> visual feedback for the
          ablation progress. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fluorescence</ENAMEX> fades as soon as the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lenticule</ENAMEX> is fully removed.
        
        
          Surgical procedure
          A total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> adult <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Zealand</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">white rabbits</ENAMEX> (average
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">weight 4-5 Kg</ENAMEX>) were anaesthetized by intramuscular
          injection of ketamine hydrochloride (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX>) and
          xylazine hydrochloride (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">7 mg/kg</ENAMEX>) mixture. All
          experimental procedures were carried out in accordance
          with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guiding Principles</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Care</ENAMEX> and Use of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Animals</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DHEW Publication</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIH</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80-23</NUMEX>) and were approved
          from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University's of Crete</ENAMEX> ethics <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committee</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> drop of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.5%</NUMEX> proparacaine hydrochloride (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alcon, Ft</ENAMEX>
          Worth, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TX</ENAMEX>) was instilled into each eye and the corneas
          were deepithelized with the use of a rotating brush. We
          treated one eye of each <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> were treated with PTK
          through <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">PALM</ENAMEX> gel (experimental eyes) and the remaining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>
          received conventional treatment and served as controls.
          The laser <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> used in all eyes was the Aesculap
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Meditec Mel</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karl-Zeiss</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jena</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>), with laser
          fluence of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">180 mJ/cm 2pulse</ENAMEX> rate at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hz</ENAMEX>, in PTK
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mode</ENAMEX>.
          Experimental eyes received <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTK</ENAMEX> through <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">PALM</ENAMEX> gel
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lenticules</ENAMEX> formed in situ onto deepithelized corneas as
          described above. In order to shorten the time of the
          surgical procedures we obtained the thinner possible
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lenticules</ENAMEX> using as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">molds</ENAMEX> the "best fitting" contact
          lenses for each operative eye. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Molds</ENAMEX> used in the current
          study had inner radii of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">curvature</ENAMEX> ranging from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.25 to 9</NUMEX>
          mm. After the removal of the mold, an iris diaphragm
          having an inner aperture of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> mm was centrated over the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pupil</ENAMEX> onto the upper surface of the lenticule to define
          the ablation <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">zone</ENAMEX>. The gel lenticules were ablated
          through with irradiation in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTK</ENAMEX> mode. As soon as
          fluorescence faded each experimental eye received an
          additional <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">60-micron</NUMEX> deep <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTK</ENAMEX>.
          The control eyes were submitted to a phototherapeutic
          keratectomy of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> mm diameter ablation <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">zone</ENAMEX> (confined by
          the same iris diaphragm), depth of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">60 μm</NUMEX>, on
          deepithelised cornea without the use of any masking
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Postoperative care
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Postoperative</ENAMEX> treatment of all treated eyes included
          daily application of combined tobramycin (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.3%</NUMEX>),
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dexamethasone</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.1%</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ointment</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alcon Ft Worth</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TX</ENAMEX>) until
          reepithelisation was complete. No <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">topical steroids</ENAMEX> were
          used subsequently in the study.
          The reepithelization process was examined <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> with
          staining of the epithelial defect area using <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2%</NUMEX>
          fluorescein dye and a hand held slit-lamp. Corneal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clarity</ENAMEX> was recorded using a predetermined <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-scale
          grading of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">haze</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] .
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> of each group (experimental and control)
          were sacrificed with an overdose of penthobarbital sodium

          Histology processing
          Immediately after enucleation the eyes were fixed

        Results
        
          Clinical course
          Reepithelisation was complete (no epithelial defect
          was observed with fluorescein staining) within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five days</TIMEX>
          in all treated eyes (within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 days</TIMEX> in two control and one
          experimental eye, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4 days</TIMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> experimental and one
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">eye</ENAMEX> and on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the fifth postoperative day</TIMEX> to the
          rest of the treated eyes). No persistent defects or
          recurrent erosions were recorded.
          Corneal haze was evident from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first week</TIMEX> in all
          treated eyes ranging from grade <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> to grade 2.
          Corneal haze reached its maximum on the first
          postoperative month ranging from grade <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 to 3</TIMEX> (grade <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> in
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> experimental eye).
          All treated eyes were clear or had minimal haze by the
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">month</TIMEX> (grade <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> in one experimental and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> control
          eyes), which was resolved in all eyes by the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">sixth</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">postoperative month</TIMEX>.
        
        
          Histology
          In the specimens taken immediately after treatment,
          the surface of corneal stroma was covered by a
          pseudomembrane typical after excimer laser. The control
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> didn't demonstrate any difference in pseudomembrane
          thickness or regularity in comparison to the experiment.
          The most typical corneal morphology is demonstrated in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">fig 2</ENAMEX>. The appearance of collagen fibrils and stromal
          keratocytes was close to normal in both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">specimens</ENAMEX>.
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4 hours</TIMEX> after irradiation, the distribution of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">collagen</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> under the ablated area was irregular due
          to the occurrence of corneal edema. Isolated macrophages
          were observed on the stromal surface. Keratocytes
          situated within the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20-40 μm</NUMEX> of the upper stroma,
          demonstrated various pathological changes including
          cytoplasm vacuolization and blebbing, with formation of
          cellular fragments (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">fig 3</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Keratocytes</ENAMEX> located deeper
          than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> μm under ablated stromal surface did not
          demonstrate any noticeable morphological alterations. We
          observed no differences in the type, degree and extent of
          the pathological changes of keratocytes under the ablated
          surface between the control and experimental specimens.
          In the endothelial corneal layer, both inside and outside
          the ablation area, we didn't observe any morphological
          abnormalities, neither in the experimental nor in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. The nuclear chromatin, abundant
          mitochondria, reticulum and coated vesicles, had normal
          appearance. The cells preserved their apical junctional
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">complexes</ENAMEX> and well developed intercellular gap
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">junctions</ENAMEX>.
          In the specimens obtained <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 week</TIMEX> after the procedure,
          the epithelium covering the stroma in the ablated zone
          demonstrated mild <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hyperplasia</ENAMEX>. The typical desmosomal
          contacts between the basal cells, which are very
          characteristic for the intact stromal epithelium, were
          rather rare (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">fig 4</ENAMEX>). However, adhesive contacts with
          significant resemblance with zonula adherens were
          observed. The morphological appearance of the
          regenerating <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">basement membrane</ENAMEX> that was removed during
          the procedure, corresponded to the initial phases of its
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reconstruction</ENAMEX>: formation of characteristic amorphous
          layer of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">extracellular matrix</ENAMEX> was evident in some contact
          zones of the epithelial cells with stroma. In some places
          this layer had focal discontinuities or duplication.
          Typical hemidesmosomes were not present. However, few
          small sized hemidesmosomes with low electron density of
          cytoplasmic plaque were observed. The presence of these
          immature hemidesmosomes was considered as an evidence of
          adhesive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contacts</ENAMEX>' reconstruction between the epithelium
          and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">basement membrane</ENAMEX>. At this stage, inflammatory
          cells infiltration was rarely observed in all obtained
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">specimens</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">anterior stroma</ENAMEX> beneath the treatment zone
          consisted of newly synthesized extracellular matrix with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">collagen</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> of irregular size and distribution, as
          well as few amorphous inclusions and "empty" spaces
          giving this layer a "foamy" appearance. The thickness of
          this locally discontinued "foam" layer did not exceed <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3-4</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">μm.</ENAMEX> The corneal endothelium of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 week</TIMEX> specimens of
          both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> had normal appearance. A discontinuous layer
          of an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">electron dense substance</ENAMEX> was observed beneath the
          boarder between the endothelial layer and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Descemet</ENAMEX>'s
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">membrane</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">fig 5</ENAMEX>).
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">One month</TIMEX> postoperatively, no epithelial
          irregularities were observed (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">fig 6</ENAMEX>). The desmosomes
          between epithelial cells, as well as the hemidesmosomes
          between the basal epithelial cells and the basal lamina,
          were more frequently observed and although irregularly
          distributed, their morphology was close to the normal
          structure of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contacts</ENAMEX> of the intact epithelium. The
          irregular distribution of hemidesmosomes can be justified
          by their concurrent reconstruction with the basal lamina
          formation. The thickness of the "foam" layer mostly
          consisted of activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibroblasts</ENAMEX>, achieved its maximum
          (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10-15 μm</NUMEX>) by this interval. The deeper corneal layers
          demonstrated exquisitely regular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">fig 7</ENAMEX>).
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Three months</TIMEX> postoperatively, the epithelium covering
          the ablation zone exceeded normal thickness only in very
          few locations (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">fig 8</ENAMEX>). The morphology of epithelial
          cells, the number of layers and the intercellular
          contacts were close to normal. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> of the
          epithelial basal lamina was also appeared close to
          normal: lamina densa and lamina lucida were well
          distinguishable with rare branching and duplication. The
          hemidesmosomes were regularly distributed, and had normal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">morphology</ENAMEX>. The thin (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2-3 μm</ENAMEX>) layer of anterior stroma
          beneath the treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">zone</ENAMEX> was close to normal, with rare
          exceptions of aggregations of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">electron dense substance</ENAMEX>,
          few <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">irregularly</ENAMEX> located collagen fibres with small
          variations of their diameter (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">fig 9</ENAMEX>). The deeper stromal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">layers</ENAMEX> had normal architecture, with no signs of
          scarring, inflammatory infiltration or deformation,
          neither in the experimental nor in the control
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">specimens</ENAMEX>.
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Six months</TIMEX> postoperatively, we didn't find any
          significant morphological difference compared to the
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three-month</TIMEX> interval obtained specimens, neither in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">experimental</ENAMEX> nor in the control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        Application of a heated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> on denuded cornea or even
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ablation</ENAMEX> through a chemical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> could affect laser-tissue
        interaction, corneal reepithelization or stromal healing
        response after photo ablation.
        We used rabbits to examine the probable effect of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PALM</ENAMEX> gel if used as a masking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTK</ENAMEX> since stromal
        healing is very similar in rabbits and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] .
        The healing course proved similar in the experimental
        and control eyes. No specimens obtained at any
        postoperative interval had any sign of necrosis or
        macrophages infiltration.
        The simultaneous reepithelization as well as the similar
        histological findings between experimental specimens and
        controls is indicative of negligible <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">gel</ENAMEX>'s impact on
        corneal healing response. The newly synthesized
        extracellular matrix presented as foam layer at the early
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">specimens</ENAMEX> is a common finding reported after photo
        refractive keratectomy or even simple epithelial scrape
        injury in a number of previous studies [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 22 23 24</NUMEX> ] and
        is supposed to manifest the healing response of rabbit
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">corneas</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 22 24</NUMEX> ] .
        The epithelial hyperplasia observed on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">seventh</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">postoperative day</TIMEX> was more intense than that reported in
        the literature [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 24 25</NUMEX> ] . The possibility of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">gel</ENAMEX>'s
        implication to this response is minimized since it was also
        observed in the control eyes. We assume that this finding
        is related to the ablation profile of our treatments (a
        rather deep keratectomy with sharp edges), which would
        justify an intense epithelial healing response [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] .
        The extrusion of electron dense fibro-granular material
        into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">descemet</ENAMEX>'s membrane is also a common finding
        observed in a number of previous studies [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21 27 28 29</NUMEX> ]
        and has been attributed to acoustic shock waves by
        irradiation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] or the distraction of the epithelial
        integrity after trauma [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] . The presence of this
        finding in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> of our specimens may be related to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">homogenous</ENAMEX> and smooth removal of the corneal epithelium
        with the rotating brush.
        In conclusion the use of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">PALM gel</ENAMEX> did not seem to
        seriously affect the healing process after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PTK</ENAMEX> on rabbit
        corneas as compared to controls. A larger number of animals
        would allow for statistical analysis of pathologic findings
        such as activated fibroblasts by depth and thickness of
        newly formed extracellular matrix between experimental and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> eyes. Furthermore, tenascin and fibronectin
        staining of the specimens would allow for better
        understanding of the corneal healing process.
        The use of new generation laser systems that offer
        phototherapeutic ablation mode with transition zones are
        expected to minimize epithelial hyperplasia and corneal
        stroma healing response. The major remaining drawback of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">PALM</ENAMEX> as well as of similar PTK techniques [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] in
        order to obtain an optimal refractive result is the
        accurate centration and placement of the molding lens for
        the proper formation of the lenticule before
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">irradiation</ENAMEX>.
