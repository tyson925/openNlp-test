        Serial analysis of gene expression (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAGE</ENAMEX>) has been used
        to profile mRNA levels in a variety of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3 4 5</NUMEX> ] . Recently, several modifications
        have been made to the protocol, to create a protocol
        referred to as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">microSAGE</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7 8 9 10</NUMEX> ] , which allows the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SAGE libraries</ENAMEX> from small quantities of
        starting material, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as little as 100,000</NUMEX> cells or <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 Î</NUMEX>¼g total
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>. These modifications include the direct binding of mRNA
        to magnetic oligo(dT) beads before the reverse
        transcription step, and a great reduction in the quantity
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">linkers</ENAMEX> used to generate ditags. While it has been shown
        that conventional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAGE</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> and accurate [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ]
        , the same has not been clearly shown for microSAGE.
        Moreover, the extent to which data generated by either SAGE
        or microSAGE are reproducible, in the sense of giving
        identical tag representation from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">duplicate samples</ENAMEX>, has
        not been thoroughly addressed. Given the time and expense
        involved in constructing and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sequencing SAGE libraries</ENAMEX>,
        concerns about how reproducible <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SAGE</ENAMEX> data are in general,
        as well as how representive and accurate microSAGE data are
        in particular, may deter potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> from pursuing this
        approach.
        We have addressed these questions by constructing and
        analyzing a series of microSAGE <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>. We made
        libraries from the same mRNA samples to examine the
        variability due to library construction, and made
        sublibraries from identical pools of ditags to examine the
        variability due to the last steps in SAGE library
        construction, as well as due to sampling. We have also made
        and analyzed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> from tissue obtained from both
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">age-matched</ENAMEX> and non-age-matched <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> to examine the
        variability due to tissue preparation as well as individual
        differences in gene expression. We found that microSAGE
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>, as previously shown for conventional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAGE</ENAMEX> data [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ]
        , are highly accurate in the sense that they reflect known
        tissue and developmental gene-expression profiles. We found
        that tag distribution is virtually identical in samples
        constructed from either identical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mRNA samples</ENAMEX> or ditag
        ligation reactions. However, we found large variations in
        tag distributions between both age-matched and
        non-age-matched human peripheral retinal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>. We even
        saw a relatively large variation in tag distributions
        between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> made from tissue pooled from small
        numbers of individual neonatal <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, a fact that may
        reflect developmental asynchrony as well as baseline
        individual variation in gene expression. This fact has
        implications for any expression-profiling approach, and
        suggests that in order to average out individual variations
        in gene expression, many different samples of a tissue of
        interest will have to be examined.
      
      
        Results
        
          MicroSAGE data are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> and
          accurate
          To determine whether microSAGE data are
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX>, we conducted a virtual Rot analysis. A
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">virtual Rot</ENAMEX> analysis, much like a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Rot</ENAMEX> analysis generated
          by measurement of mRNA reassociation kinetics, examines
          the relative fraction of total mRNA made up of
          transcripts of high, medium or low abundance. It is
          constructed from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAGE</ENAMEX> data by cumulatively plotting the
          total fraction of all tags represented by tags of a given
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">abundance</ENAMEX> level. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Virtual Rot</ENAMEX> analyses of adult mouse
          whole retina and adult hypothalamus showed a distribution
          that closely reflects an actual <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Rot</ENAMEX> analysis of mouse
          brain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> (Figure 1a,1b<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,1</NUMEX>c) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] .
          To determine whether microSAGE data can provide an
          accurate measure of mRNA abundance - that is, give tag
          levels that match levels of mRNAs for which abundance
          levels have previously been measured - we examined our
          adult mouse retinal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> for tags corresponding to
          several such mRNAs. Although no absolute quantification
          of mRNAs in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse retina</ENAMEX> has been made, measurement of
          rhodopsin, beta-tubulin and interphotoreceptor
          retinol-binding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (IRBP) mRNAs in adult <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> retina
          indicate that these represent <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.25</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.5%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.2%</NUMEX> and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.2%</NUMEX> of total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>, respectively [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . These
          figures are based on the observation that mRNA consists
          of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">roughly 2%</NUMEX> of total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> in both <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> retina
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.B. and C.L.C.</ENAMEX>, unpublished work). In the mouse, we
          found that rhodopsin represented <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.1%</NUMEX>, beta-tubulin
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.08%</NUMEX>, and IRBP <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.13%</NUMEX> of total <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">SAGE tags</ENAMEX>, values that on
          the whole approximate levels reported for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX>. The slight
          discrepancy in beta-tubulin levels between <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> and mouse
          may reflect <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species variability</ENAMEX> in gene-expression
          levels, or the failure to identify all alternative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">3</ENAMEX>'
          ends of the beta-tubulin message by microSAGE.
          Additional analyses to determine the accuracy of
          microSAGE data were carried out by examining a series of
          libraries from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse retina</ENAMEX> and hypothalamus. We have
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">constructed SAGE</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse hypothalamus</ENAMEX>; total
          wild-type mouse retina at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2-day</TIMEX> intervals from embryonic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">day</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">E</ENAMEX>) <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12.5</NUMEX> through to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">postnatal day</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX>) <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.5</NUMEX>; P10.5
          wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> along with littermates mutant for the 
          crx <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> (which encodes a Paired
          type homeodomain transcription factor that directly
          regulates transcription of many photoreceptor-enriched
          genes); <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult</ENAMEX> mouse retina; and microdissected outer
          nuclear layer, which consists entirely of rod and cone
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">photoreceptors</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . We examined this very large
          dataset for expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> known to be photoreceptor
          specific (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). We found that photoreceptor-specific
          genes typically showing high, retina-specific expression
          that began around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one week</TIMEX> after birth, coinciding
          exactly with the previously reported increase in
          expression of rhodopsin and other rod-specific genes [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15</NUMEX> ] . We typically saw higher expression of
          photoreceptor-specific genes in microSAGE <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> made
          from microdissected outer nuclear layer (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">97%</NUMEX> rods versus
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70%</NUMEX> rods for whole retina) and, in many cases, higher
          expression in P10.5 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">crx</ENAMEX> +/+samples relative to P10.5 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">crx -/-</ENAMEX>samples. These observations
          accurately reflect the known expression pattern of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rod</ENAMEX>-specific genes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . Examining the temporal
          dataset for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> that are known to be selectively
          expressed in retinal progenitor cells (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>), we
          found that high expression persisted until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P2</TIMEX>, followed
          by a rapid drop, with expression barely detectable in the
          adult. These data correlate well with the time course of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mitosis</ENAMEX> within the developing retina [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 17</NUMEX> ] .
        
        
          Cumulative distributions of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>-values indicate the
          differences among microSAGE <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> way to measure the significance of the differences
          between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> is to see the cumulative distribution
          function of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -values. If the difference
          between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> is large, we would see a large
          number of SAGE tags with small 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -values for that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX>, compared
          to a pair in which the only source of variation is
          experimental variability in microSAGE library
          construction. The 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -values we compute are the
          probability of observing the different tag counts for
          each gene when there is no differential expression.
          Although comparing the cumulative distributions does not
          match the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> on a gene-by-gene basis, it gives an
          overall picture of the qualitative differences.
          Cumulative 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -value distributions for all
          libraries considered in this study are plotted in Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. We investigated a variety of statistical methods of
          calculating 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -values for differences in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAGE</ENAMEX>
          tag distribution in addition to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Monte Carlo</ENAMEX> analysis
          program included in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAGE</ENAMEX> analysis software. These
          included a test for equality of proportions (equivalent
          to the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">chi-square</NUMEX> test), modeling the sampling of tags
          using the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Poisson</ENAMEX> distribution, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fisher</ENAMEX>'s exact test, and
          a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Bayesian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>. We found that all methods gave similar
          results for the range of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -values considered here (see
          Materials and methods for a more complete discussion of
          these comparisons).
        
        
          Visualization of the data in rotated coordinates
          reveals the relationship between average count and fold
          changes
          We find it convenient to view the data in a log scale
          in rotated coordinates, going from the original
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">coordinates</ENAMEX> ( 
          x , 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">y</ENAMEX> ) to the new coordinate system
          (log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">xy</ENAMEX> ), log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">y /</ENAMEX> 
          x )). This transformation
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">corresponds</ENAMEX> to a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45</NUMEX>-degree rotation and a linear
          stretching of the log-scaled data (log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ( 
          x ), log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">y</ENAMEX> )). This type of plot has been
          popular for microarray data, with the 
          x - and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">y</ENAMEX> -axes corresponding to the mean
          intensity of the signals and their fold ratio,
          respectively, up to scaling constants [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 19</NUMEX> ] . For tag
          counts, the axes become the sum of the log counts and the
          fold change, respectively, with no rescaling necessary.
          This makes it easier to visualize the data, with
          horizontal lines rather than diagonal lines corresponding
          to fold changes. We can easily identify those genes with
          large fold changes and see the relationship between the
          average count and the fold change. We note that although
          it is advantageous to work in a log scale for the
          fold-change interpretation, it means that those genes
          with tag count of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> in either <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> are deleted from
          the picture. Another way of viewing the data is to plot
          differences in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> counts, rather than their fold
          ratios, as a function of the mean log count. Both ways
          contain the same information, and one can be derived from
          the other.
          To gauge the baseline <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">variability</ENAMEX> arising from library
          construction in the microSAGE process, we consider the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> made from the same mRNA sample ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">crxA</ENAMEX> versus 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">crxB</ENAMEX> ). In Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5c</TIMEX>, we plot the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> along with a 'confidence <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX>' corresponding to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          standard deviations away from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> at each average
          log count. (This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> was computed using a locally
          weighted smoothing technique based on the standard
          deviations in the neighborhood of each point.) As we
          expect [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] , the fold changes due to noise are higher
          at lower tag counts. This confidence <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> can serve as a
          rough measure of the variability in the system due to
          experimental procedures. The same confidence band from
          this comparison is superimposed on Figure
          5a,b,c,<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">d</ENAMEX>,e,f,<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g</ENAMEX>,h,ito see how the variability present in
          comparisons of different <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> compares to variation
          seen in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> made from the same starting material.
          See the additional data files for a full list of tag
          counts in each of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAGE</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> comparisons in the
          Results section.
        
        
          MicroSAGE data are highly reproducible
          To examine microSAGE data for reproducibility, several
          analyses were carried out. As a baseline gauge of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variability</ENAMEX> in tag sampling, we compared the collection
          of tags comprising the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26,000</NUMEX> tags obtained from
          the microdissected outer nuclear layer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> to the
          collection of tags comprising the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26,000</NUMEX> tags
          obtained from this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX>. A scatter plot of tag
          abundance showed a correlation coefficient of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.976</NUMEX> when
          all tags were considered or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.819</NUMEX> when only tags present
          less than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> times in total in both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">examined</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). A plot of cumulative observed 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -values of tag differences in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples normalized</ENAMEX> to total tag <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">number</ENAMEX> showed no increase
          of observed variance over expected variance (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>),
          and no high-abundance tags fell outside the confidence
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">band</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> standard deviations plotted for comparisons
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> made from identical starting material
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5a</NUMEX>). P2.5 retinal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> made from the same
          ditag ligation, but different large-scale PCR
          preparations, showed a correlation coefficient of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.938</NUMEX>
          when all tags were considered, little difference between
          observed and expected 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -values of variance (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>),
          and showed relatively little difference between abundant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tags</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5b</NUMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> made from the same
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">posnatal day</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10.5</NUMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">crx</ENAMEX> +/+<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mRNA samples</ENAMEX> (that is, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> sample was divided into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> tubes at the onset of the
          reverse-transcription step) showed a correlation
          coefficient of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.939</NUMEX>, showed very little difference
          between observed and chance cumulative 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -values of variance (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>),
          and showed little difference between abundant tags
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5c</NUMEX>). These data show that microSAGE data are
          highly reproducible when identical starting material is
          used to generate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2for</ENAMEX> a full list of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">libraries</ENAMEX> and comparisons). Although the amount of
          starting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">material</ENAMEX> used to generate each of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>
          varied somewhat, we did not find any substantial changes
          in the fraction of duplicate ditags found in each
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">library</ENAMEX>, which we have found to be more or less constant
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 5%</NUMEX>) when <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 1</NUMEX> Î¼g total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> is used
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.B. and C.L.C.</ENAMEX>, data not shown).
          The correlation coefficients, particularly for the
          self-self comparison (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ONL1 versus ONL2</ENAMEX>) when only tags
          present <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 100</NUMEX> times in total were considered, may
          seem somewhat low, compared to correlation coefficients
          computed for microarray data [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 22 23</NUMEX> ] . However, any
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">digital</ENAMEX> gene-expression dataset shows a certain amount of
          noise due simply to sampling variability, particularly
          for lower-abundance transcripts [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . Even if <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> tags
          are actually found at identical levels in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>,
          the observed values of those tags will show a Poisson
          distribution about the actual values, thus resulting in a
          lower observed correlation coefficient. This is
          particularly true for lower-abundance transcripts, and is
          clearly seen in the substantially lower correlation
          coefficients that are observed when very high-abundant
          transcripts are excluded from analysis (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
          Multiple replicate experiments, which are typically
          carried out in microarray studies, might filter out some
          of this noise, but such replicates are not feasible given
          the expense and time required to generate microSAGE data.
          In any case, the absolute 
          r -values are not as important as
          the relative changes in the correlation coefficients
          observed as a result of experimental or sample
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variability</ENAMEX> when considering the data presented here.
        
        
          MicroSAGE data show pronounced differences in gene
          expression between age and sex-matched samples
          As the above data indicate that the microSAGE protocol
          does not introduce differences in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> made from
          identical starting material, it is possible to interpret
          the gene-expression differences that might be found among
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>. To begin to probe such individual
          variations, we analyzed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> from individual human
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">retinal samples</ENAMEX> and from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">genotypically identical mice</ENAMEX>
          from the same litter, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">genotypically identical mice</ENAMEX>
          raised in different animal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX>. MicroSAGE
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">libraries</ENAMEX> generated from freshly dissected peripheral
          retina from similarly aged adult male <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> gave a
          correlation coefficient of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.673</NUMEX> when all tags were
          considered, a substantial difference between observed and
          chance 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -values of variance between the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">samples</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>), and many tags lie outside the
          confidence band plotted for comparisons of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> made
          from identical starting material (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5d</NUMEX>). These
          differences were substantially similar to differences in
          expression seen between peripheral retinal libraries
          obtained from a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44-year-old</TIMEX> and an 88-year-old
          individual, which showed a correlation coefficient of
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">0.760</TIMEX> when all tags were considered, a large difference
          between observed and expected 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -values of variance (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>),
          and large number of differences in high-abundance tags
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5e</NUMEX>).
          Retinas from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> P6<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse litter</ENAMEX> were used to
          generate <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">SAGE libraries</ENAMEX>, with retinas from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> P6.5
          littermates combined to generate <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> (P6.5A) and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> different P6<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.5</NUMEX> littermates combined to make another
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P6.5B</ENAMEX>). Many differences in gene expression were
          observed, and an overall correlation coefficient of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.661</NUMEX>
          was seen when all tags were considered (Figures <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4, 5f</TIMEX>).
          Some of these differences appear to be in known
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rod</ENAMEX>-specific genes, and may reflect developmental
          asynchrony, as this is the time at which high-level
          expression of rod-specific genes is <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> observed,
          although most of the observed differences do not appear
          to be found in genes that show dramatic variation in
          expression through development. We also examined <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          hypothalamus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>; each constructed from age-matched
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">male mice</ENAMEX> of the same strain, obtained from animals
          raised in different <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX>. These samples showed a
          correlation coefficient of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.782</NUMEX> when all tags were
          considered or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.500</NUMEX> when highly abundant tags were
          excluded, a high value for cumulative 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -value differences (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>),
          and large numbers of tag differences (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5g</NUMEX>),
          suggesting that pronounced variation in gene expression
          is found even in genetically identical age- and
          sex-matched <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> housed in similar laboratory
          environments.
          To understand the significance of these individual
          differences, we also compared disparate tissues. We
          compared <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> CNS tissues, the adult retina and
          hypothalamus, which showed a correlation coefficient of
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">0.763</TIMEX> when all tags were considered or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.349</NUMEX> when highly
          abundant tags were excluded (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5h</NUMEX>). We also compared
          a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNS</ENAMEX> tissue and a non-CNS tissue, adult retina and 3T3
          fibroblasts, which showed a correlation coefficient of
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">0.479</TIMEX> when all tags were considered or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.182</NUMEX> when highly
          abundant tags were excluded (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5i</NUMEX>). Examination of
          the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -value plots (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) reveals
          many more tags that differ at low 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -values in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNS</ENAMEX> and non-CNS
          tissue comparison than in the comparison of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> CNS
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tissues</ENAMEX>. Likewise, plots of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -value differences versus tag
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">abundance</ENAMEX> (Figure 5h,5i) show substantially more
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variability</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNS</ENAMEX> versus peripheral tissue
          comparison. See additional data files for a full list of
          tag counts in each of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAGE</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> comparisons
          discussed here.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MicroSAGE</ENAMEX> is highly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX>, reproducible
          and accurate
          We found that tag abundance data measured by microSAGE
          reliably reflect mRNA abundance profiles, despite the
          fact that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly 1,000</NUMEX>-fold less starting mRNA was used
          here than is used to construct <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> in conventional
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAGE</ENAMEX>. Tag distribution as determined by microSAGE closely
          mirrors profiles seen by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Rot</ENAMEX> analysis of brain tissue.
          Likewise, tag abundance levels in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> made from
          identical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mRNA samples</ENAMEX> and ditag ligations showed very
          high similarity. The fact that the tag abundance levels
          differ slightly more in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> made from the same
          ditag ligation than in those made from the same mRNA
          sample may reflect a small amount of denaturation of
          AT-rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ditags</ENAMEX> during storage of the ligation reaction,
          as has been previously reported [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] . Overall,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">microSAGE</ENAMEX> passes all the tests for representativity,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reproducibility</ENAMEX> and accuracy used previously for
          conventional SAGE [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] .
        
        
          Differences in gene expression were observed among
          samples of the same tissues from different
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>
          The high reliability of microSAGE data revealed in
          these analyses allows us to report the first
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comprehensive</ENAMEX> profiles of levels of difference in gene
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">expression</ENAMEX> observed among tissues obtained from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX>- and
          sex-matched <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>. The variability among the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">samples</ENAMEX> observed does not appear to be due to
          experimental variability in library construction. Thus,
          it is due either to differences in the processing of the
          tissues used to generate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries -</ENAMEX> in variations in
          mRNA stability between tissue collection and mRNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">purification</ENAMEX> or in heterogeneous tissue dissection - or
          to real variations in gene expression among
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>.
          Although no studies to our knowledge have addressed
          the question directly, the limited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> of data on
          expression profiling of age- and sex-matched <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>
          generally reports significant variation in gene
          expression among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 26 27</NUMEX> ] , although
          little of these data are publicly available. On the other
          hand, the literature on inter-individual variation in
          gene expression in inbred <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> is both limited and
          somewhat inconsistent. While many studies have examined
          expression in inbred <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, the extent of variation in
          gene expression in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX>- and sex-matched <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> is
          rarely addressed. Published microarray experiments using
          inbred <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> have been typically conducted using pooled
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> from anywhere from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ]
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>. Likewise, for other methods of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-expression profiling such as differential display
          and its variations [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SAGE</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] , most
          previously published work has either been focused on
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> from large numbers of pooled <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>, or has
          considered individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> that were not strain, age or
          sex matched.
          Our results agree quite well with several recent
          reports in which inter-individual variation in gene
          expression is explicitly examined. A recent study
          reported a high degree of variation in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> levels in rat
          hippocampus taken from different <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>. A large
          fraction of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> genes tested by quantitative
          reverse transcription <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> (RT-PCR) were found to vary
          significantly, even among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> from inbred strains
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] . Another study reported analysis of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inter</ENAMEX>-individual variations in gene expression in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">testis</ENAMEX> and kidney of male <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">C57B/6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> using a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5000</TIMEX>-spot
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microarray</ENAMEX>. This study found that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.8%</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.9%</NUMEX>
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">testes</NUMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.3%</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">kidney</ENAMEX>) of all genes differed between
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> at 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p â¤ 0.05</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] . The data from
          kidney compare fairly well with our data in Figure 4for
          littermate-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">littermate</NUMEX> variation (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.5%</NUMEX> of SAGE tags
          different at 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p â¤ 0.05</ENAMEX>, after subtracting the
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.5%</NUMEX> of tags different at 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p â¤ 0.05</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the ONL1</TIMEX> versus ONL2
          sampling control) or even human-human variation (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8%</NUMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAGE</ENAMEX> tags different at 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p â¤ 0.05</ENAMEX> following subtraction of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sampling</ENAMEX> variation). Because our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> are all
          derived from neural tissue, our roughly twofold higher
          variability may reflect greater experience-dependent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">plasticity</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNS</ENAMEX>. Several other microarray studies
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">inbred mice</ENAMEX>, while not specifically reporting
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inter</ENAMEX>-individual changes in expression, nonetheless
          reported considerable differences in both brain and
          peripheral tissues among different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34 35</NUMEX> ]
          .
          There are, however, several published microarray
          experiments in which, although <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> variation in
          gene expression was not explicitly addressed, variation
          in gene expression in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX>- and sex-matched individual
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> or pooled samples of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three or</NUMEX> fewer <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> was
          measured and found to be relatively small [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36 37 38 39</NUMEX> ]
          . These include data from both peripheral tissue and
          brain that reported 
          r -values for individual <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> at
          around 0.98 [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37 38</NUMEX> ] , and one publicly available
          dataset of inter-individual comparisons of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNS</ENAMEX> tissues [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38</NUMEX> ] . We analyzed this dataset and found it to have
          correlation coefficients in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.97</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.98</NUMEX> range (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.B.</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">W.P.K. and C.L.C</ENAMEX>, data not shown). On the face of it,
          this seems at odds with our and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>' data
          demonstrating considerable variation in gene expression -
          our 
          r -values being in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.65</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.8</NUMEX>
          range for the developing retina and hypothalamus
          comparisons. None of these published data was from the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypothalamus</ENAMEX> or developing retina, so it is possible that
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> we analyzed show greater inter-individual
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variability</ENAMEX>. However, this sort of direct comparison
          between expression profiling methods may not be
          appropriate. Expression changes observed in microarray
          experiments can, in principle and in the hands of some
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX>, accurately reflect expression-level
          changes observed by northern or quantitative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> data
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> ] . However, other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> (including
          ourselves) have found that both oligonucleotide and cDNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microarray</ENAMEX> consistently underestimate true fold changes
          in mRNA levels as measured by northern or RT-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 41</NUMEX>
          ] . This is most probably due to background hybridization
          to the array and signal normalization, and is not an
          issue for digital-expression profiling approaches such as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAGE</ENAMEX>. Underestimating differences in mRNA levels will
          give rise to higher observed 
          r -values. While we cannot be sure
          that this was the case for the studies mentioned above,
          given the variation in microarray hybridization and
          scanning protocols among different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX>, it
          remains a distinct possibility. This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX>, together
          with other recent studies that raise questions about the
          ability to accurately perform cross-platform comparisons
          of gene-expression datasets [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42 43</NUMEX> ] , prevents us from
          drawing firm conclusions about the true extent of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inter</ENAMEX>-individual differences from the published
          microarray data. It will require <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SAGE</ENAMEX> and microarray
          analysis of identical starting material, coupled with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">northern</ENAMEX> or RT-PCR verification of genes that show
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inter</ENAMEX>-individual variation by either or both methods, to
          gauge exactly how accurately either method estimates
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inter</ENAMEX>-individual differences in gene expression. This,
          however, is beyond the scope of the current study.
        
        
          Heterogeneous dissection cannot account for most of
          the inter-individual differences observed
          The observed differences among microSAGE <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>
          made from identical tissue from different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>
          could have resulted from heterogeneous tissue dissection.
          We addressed this question for our retinal samples.
          Because our P6.5 mouse retina <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> were made from
          total retina stripped of surrounding tissues (such as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">lens</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">retinal pigment epithelium</ENAMEX>), we determined
          whether tags corresponding to genes highly expressed in
          those tissues (such as crystallins, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">RPE65</TIMEX>, RGR-like
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">opsin</ENAMEX>) were found in these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>, and determined that
          they were not expressed in either <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX>, except
          occasionally at the single tag level (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.B. and C.L.C.</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> not shown). Moreover, inter-individual variation in
          cell-type composition among murine retinas appears to be
          minimal [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> ] , and thus variable ratios of cell types
          in dissected retinas does not appear to account for the
          observed variation.
          Rods represent a greater fraction of cells in the
          periphery of the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">retina</ENAMEX>, while <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cones</ENAMEX> and ganglion
          cells represent a greater fraction of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> near the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">center</ENAMEX>. Observed differences in tag levels between the
          human peripheral <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">retina libraries</ENAMEX> could be reflecting
          small differences in the radial distance from the fovea
          of the dissected region. We found, however, that although
          a number of the tags that differ by 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p â¤ 0.005</ENAMEX> between the 44-year-old
          and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> corresponded to known
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rod</ENAMEX>-enriched <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, the direction of change was not
          consistent between the two samples. Although more tags
          corresponding to known rod-enriched <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were at a
          higher level in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> from the 44-year-old
          individual, many other rod-enriched <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were more
          highly represented in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> from the 41-year-old
          individual. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the tags that was higher in the
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> corresponded to a known
          ganglion-cell-specific gene, whereas none of the tags
          that were more highly expressed in the 41-year-old
          individual corresponded to ganglion-cell-specific genes
          (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3for</ENAMEX> a summary of this data). Moreover, when
          compared to data from our previously published work
          analyzing genes that show either peripheral or foveal
          enrichment in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> taken from the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> at
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p â¤ 0.005</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX> ] , we likewise
          found no consistent pattern in the tags that differed
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between the 44-year-old</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41-year-old</TIMEX> peripheral
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">retinas</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>).
          It is more difficult to rule out heterogeneous
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dissection</ENAMEX> as a variable in the differences seen in the
          hypothalamus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>, particularly as tissue
          dissections were carried out by different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX>.
          Unlike in the retina, we lack good markers that are both
          highly expressed in adjacent tissues and excluded from
          the hypothalamus, and are thus unable to directly
          evaluate our hypothalamic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> for contamination.
          The great majority of differences observed, however, seem
          to represent differences in very broadly expressed
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX>, particularly <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal</ENAMEX> and mitochondrial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.B. and C.L.C.</ENAMEX>, data not shown), suggesting
          that heterogeneous dissection is unlikely to account for
          most of the differences observed. However, we cannot rule
          out the possibility that some smaller fraction of the
          differences is due to heterogeneous dissection of the
          starting material for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA instability</ENAMEX> following tissue dissection does
          not account for most of the inter-individual differences
          observed
          While major differences in gene expression were
          observed in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> generated from different
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>, some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> used to generate these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">libraries</ENAMEX> differ in their storage conditions before
          processing. The interval between enucleation and freezing
          was <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">45 minutes</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 44-year-old</TIMEX> and 88-year-old
          retinas, whereas the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">retina</ENAMEX> was kept at room
          temperature for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4 hours</TIMEX> and then processed for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">extraction</ENAMEX>. The tissue used to make the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> P6.5 mouse
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">libraries</ENAMEX> was harvested and frozen <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 minutes</TIMEX> later, but
          the periods over which the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> were stored at
          -80Â°C were different <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-1 week</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6 months</TIMEX>, respectively.
          It is thus possible that differences in tag distribution
          among the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> might represent differential mRNA
          stability following tissue collection. Several reports
          have indicated a high level of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> stability for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to 48</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> postmortem in tissue kept at room temperature [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47 48 49</NUMEX> ] , and no reports to our knowledge have
          indicated instability of mRNA in tissue stored long term
          at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-80Â°C</TIMEX>. However, as SAGE comprehensively profiles
          cellular mRNA expression, while previous studies examined
          only a handful of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> transcripts [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46 47 48 49</NUMEX> ] ,
          it could be that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">SAGE</ENAMEX> identifies unstable transcripts
          that are missed by a candidate-gene approach.
          The correlation coefficient between tag abundance
          levels in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 44-year-old</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">88-year-old</TIMEX> retinal
          samples, which were both processed <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">45 minutes</TIMEX> after
          enucleation, is substantially higher than the correlation
          coefficient between the retinal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> from the
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44-year-old</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>. This is so
          despite the fact that the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44-year-old</TIMEX> and 88-year-old
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> differ not only in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> but also in sex. This
          could mean that a major portion of the observed variance
          might result from differential processing and/or storage
          of the tissue before mRNA preparation. However,
          comparison of expression of genes that differ by 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p â¤ 0.005</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAGE libraries</ENAMEX>
          from the peripheral retinas from the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44-year-old</TIMEX> and the
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> indicates a roughly equal
          magnitude and direction of change of overall expression
          levels between the samples (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). Were the
          differences between the samples largely due to
          differential mRNA stability, one would expect to see a
          subset of mRNAs that were much reduced in expression in
          the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41-year-old</TIMEX> sample, as that one spent a longer period
          of time between enucleation and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> extraction. One might
          also expect to see a fraction of more stable transcripts
          showing a small, compensatory increase in relative
          frequency, but this is not the case. The most likely
          explanation then for the differences between the
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41-year-old</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44-year-old</TIMEX> samples is variation in gene
          expression.
          The observed variation between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> P6.5 mouse
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">libraries</ENAMEX> was more surprising. As <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.8%</NUMEX> of the tags that
          differ at 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p â¤ 0.005</ENAMEX> represent known
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rod</ENAMEX>-specific genes (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.B. and C.L.C.</ENAMEX>, data not shown), a
          small subset of these results probably partially reflect
          minor differences in developmental timing, and some of
          the other differences in tag <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">abundance</ENAMEX> may also reflect
          variation in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> expressed in a dynamic manner during
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>. Other differences may reflect differences in
          mRNA stability during long-term frozen storage. However,
          as with the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX>, the direction of a roughly
          equal magnitude and direction of change of expression
          levels is seen in tags that differ at 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p â¤ 0.005</ENAMEX> between the samples
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>), suggesting that differential mRNA stability
          is not the cause of observed variation. This also
          suggests that for both the human-human and
          littermate-littermate comparisons, no major selective
          mRNA degradation occurs between tissue harvesting and
          binding of the mRNA to the magnetic oligo(dT)-coupled
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">beads</ENAMEX>. The source of most of the variation between the
          samples thus remains unclear. One animal that was a
          developmental outlier is a possible explanation. For
          example, litters of inbred <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> sometimes have a runt,
          suggesting a difference in rate of development and/or
          other factors. However, much of our data collected and
          analyzed for other purposes would suggest that such
          outliers are rare, at least with respect to eye
          development [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 23</NUMEX> ] .
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inter</ENAMEX>-individual differences in gene expression are
          most likely to account for the observed differences in
          tag distribution
          A final source of the observed variability between
          individual samples probably reflects real individual
          differences in gene expression. It may partially reflect
          genetic polymorphisms that give rise to different 
          Nla III <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> and hence different
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAGE</ENAMEX> tags, although this is unlikely to explain observed
          differences in gene expression between the inbred <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>.
          The fact that the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41-year-old</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44-year-old</TIMEX> human
          samples, as well as the murine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hypothalamus samples</ENAMEX>, were
          both obtained from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> implies that differential
          expression of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">X</NUMEX>-inactivated polymorphic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alleles</ENAMEX> cannot
          explain the observed differences. A fraction of the
          variation is likely to represent either differential
          environmentally induced patterns of gene expression or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stochastic</ENAMEX> variation in gene expression that persists in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult</ENAMEX>. In tissues such as the hypothalamus, where we
          see large differences in gene expression in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX>- and
          sex-matched <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> of the same strain, this variability may
          reflect high levels of variability in behavior that are
          seen in inbred <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> raised and tested under seemingly
          identical laboratory conditions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> ] .
          Moreover, the high variability that is seen in both
          the development and gene-expression profiles of cloned
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34 51</NUMEX> ] , and the relatively low heritability of
          many quantitative traits such as lifespan or psychiatric
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> that is observed in monozygotic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">twins</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">52 53</NUMEX> ] ,
          implies that there is substantial variability in gene
          expression even in genetically identical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>,
          particularly in tissues of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNS</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        We have shown that the microSAGE method, like
        conventional SAGE analysis, is highly accurate and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX>. Furthermore, we have shown that it is
        highly reproducible when different <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> are made from
        the same starting mRNA samples. However, we find that
        considerable differences in gene expression are observed
        between samples of the same tissue taken from different
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>. These may reflect minor differences in the
        processing or storage of the samples, or may represent real
        differences in gene expression. Further experiments are
        required to resolve this issue. In any case, these data
        show that a measure of caution is required when comparing
        tag abundance levels in different SAGE <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> that were
        not processed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">identically</ENAMEX> or obtained from the same
        individual.

            Testing for equality of proportions
            In this method, we want to see if the difference
            between the proportions 
            p 
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1</TIMEX> = 
            x<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/A</ENAMEX> and 
            p 
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX> = 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">y/B</ENAMEX> is significant [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . Each
            tag here is viewed as a random variable following a
            binomial distribution, which can be approximated by a
            normal distribution in this case because the total
            count is large. The statistic of interest is
            
            We can compute the 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -value or the confidence
            interval from this statistic. This test is conceptually
            simple and easy to implement. There is no need to
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">perform Monte-Carlo</ENAMEX> simulations as done in the software
            by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">SAGE 3.0.1</TIMEX>, as they seem to give similar
            results.
          
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Poisson</ENAMEX> model
            We can use <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Poisson</ENAMEX> distribution to model the
            sampling of tags, as the selection of a particular tag
            can be regarded as a random event with a small
            probability. Considering the probability of observing 
            y occurrences of a clone already
            observed 
            x times, we have the formula [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>
            ]
            
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -values can be computed by
            summing up the appropriate tail of the
            distribution.
          
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fisher</ENAMEX>'s exact test
            When we think of the data as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2 Ã 2</ENAMEX> table, the
            most common way to compute the 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -value is the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">chi-square</NUMEX> test,
            which can be shown to be equivalent to the equality of
            proportion test described above. For a small number of
            tag counts, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fisher</ENAMEX>'s exact test may be used, which
            computes the exact probability of the observed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> Ã <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
            table (containing 
            x, y, A-x, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">B-y</ENAMEX> ) based on a
            hypergeometric distribution assuming that the marginals
            are fixed.
          
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Bayesian Model</ENAMEX>
            We can also use a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Bayesian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> with a prior
            distribution for the likely fold changes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">56</TIMEX> ] . The
            prior distribution is often specified using a beta
            function (for mathematical convenience) and the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">parameter</ENAMEX> is chosen to reflect the distribution of
            changes in expression levels between experimental
            conditions. This approach allows <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to estimate the
            probability that the proportions differ by a given
            factor.
            The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of these methods are closely
            related. For example, the binomial distribution
            (related to the equality of proportions method, and
            which serves as the basis for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Monte Carlo</ENAMEX> analysis
            conducted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SAGE 3.0.1</ENAMEX> data analysis software)
            with small probability and large sample size converges
            to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Poisson</ENAMEX> distribution; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fisher</ENAMEX>'s exact test should
            replace the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">chi-square</NUMEX> test when the number of counts
            in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2 Ã 2</ENAMEX> contingency table becomes very small (<
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>, roughly speaking). For our data, we have found that
            all these methods give very similar results, and the
            difference in the 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -values is noticeable only for
            the very small 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -values (that is < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
            -<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>).
