        Scorpion venom is a rich source of various polypeptides
        with diverse physiological and pharmacological activities
        which generally exert their action via target specific
        modulation of ion channel function [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3</NUMEX> ] . Among the
        well characterized peptide toxins are those from the venom
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">scorpions</ENAMEX> belonging to the family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Buthidae</ENAMEX>. Buthoid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">venom</ENAMEX> has been reported to strongly affect a wide variety
        of vertebrate and invertebrate <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] and its
        toxicity is attributed to the presence of a large variety
        of basic polypeptides cross-linked by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> disulfide <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridges</ENAMEX>
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 4</NUMEX> ] . Based on their molecular size and pharmacological
        activity, these toxins are classified into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> main <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>.
        The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> group contains short toxins (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30-40</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">residues</ENAMEX>) with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3-4</ENAMEX> disulfide <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridges</ENAMEX> which mainly affect
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">voltage</ENAMEX> dependent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> +<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> and the large conductance
        calcium activated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> +<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6</NUMEX> ] . The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> group
        includes long-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60-70</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>) peptides cross
        linked by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> disulfide <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridges</ENAMEX> which mainly have an effect
        on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">voltage</TIMEX> dependent sodium channels of excitable cells [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ] . According to their <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> selectivity sodium channel
        toxins have been divided into mammalian and insect toxins.
        Furthermore, depending on their binding affinities and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electrophysiological</ENAMEX> properties, the mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">toxins</ENAMEX> are
        sub-classified into <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Î±- and Î²- toxins</NUMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8</NUMEX> ] , and the
        insect-specific toxins are subdivided into excitatory,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">depressant</ENAMEX> and Î±- insect toxins [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . Several toxins
        which specifically affect sodium and potassium channels
        have been extensively studied with respect to their
        structure, mode of action and pharmacological properties [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 6 10</NUMEX> ] . In addition to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> main <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of toxins,
        several other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">toxins</ENAMEX> targeted toward Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+ [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cl</ENAMEX> - [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> have also been isolated during the past
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decade</TIMEX>.
        Owing to their <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species selectivity</ENAMEX>, increasing attention
        has been paid in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX> to identify insect-selective
        toxins that can be used to develop recombinant
        biopesticides as a safer alternative to broad spectrum
        chemical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insecticides</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13 14</NUMEX> ] . Several
        insect-selective <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">toxins</ENAMEX> have been identified and purified
        from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">scorpions</NUMEX> collected in different geographical
        locations [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 11 15 16 17 18</NUMEX> ] . However, the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> red
        scorpion, 
        Mesobuthus tamulus, known for its
        severe toxicity [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 20</NUMEX> ] received little attention in this
        regard. The few studies documented on 
        Buthus tamulus are restricted to the
        isolation and purification of neurotoxins, protease
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inhibitors</ENAMEX>, histamine releasers [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">iberiotoxin</ENAMEX>, an
        inhibitor of high conductance Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+-activated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> +<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> ] and neurotoxin <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Bt-II</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . In the quest for natural
        insect-selective toxins, we have identified a novel short
        lepidopteran-selective <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">toxin</ENAMEX> from the venom of 
        Mesobuthus tamulus having <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37</NUMEX> amino
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids residues</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 half</NUMEX>-cystines. We named it as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ButaIT</ENAMEX> (
        
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. tamulus</ENAMEX> insect <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">toxin</ENAMEX>) which has
        high sequence homology with a few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">short toxins</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 22 23</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 25 26 27</NUMEX> ] and shows high selectivity to a lepidopteran
        insect, 
        Heliothis virescens. This paper
        describes isolation, purification, and sequence
        determination of this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">toxin</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Results and Discussion
        
          Bioassay driven purification of ButaIT
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CM-52</ENAMEX> cation exchange column yielded <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7</TIMEX> peaks at
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">280 nm</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig- 1</ENAMEX>). When <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CM</ENAMEX> fractions were tested for
          lethality on <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, only CM-fraction III and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">crude</ENAMEX> venom
          were found to be toxic at a dose of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3 Î¼g/g</ENAMEX> body weight.
          Among all the CM fractions, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CM</ENAMEX> fraction <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX> accounted for
          almost all of the lethality to tobacco <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">budworm</ENAMEX>. Hence
          further studies were conducted using <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only CM fraction</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX>.
          Fractionation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CM-IV</ENAMEX> yielded <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> peaks using ion-pair
          reversed phase <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">HPLC (Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). Bioassay of the individual
          HPLC fractions of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CM-IV</ENAMEX> fraction on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tobacco budworm</ENAMEX>,
          blowfly larvae and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> led to the localization of
          lepidopteran selective toxicity in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CM-IV</ENAMEX> fraction 6
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). Administration of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CM-IV HPLC</ENAMEX> fractions to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tobacco budworm</ENAMEX> at a dose of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1 Î¼g/100</ENAMEX> mg larva showed
          slow and progressive <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">flaccid</TIMEX> paralysis only with fraction
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>. Other fractions were ineffective at this dose. Hence,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">fraction 6</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CM-IV-6</ENAMEX>) was collected, lyophilized and
          resolved further using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPLC</ENAMEX> gradient system-<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">II</ENAMEX> which
          yielded <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> peaks: <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CM-IV-6A</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CM-IV-6B</ENAMEX>. Among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">fraction CM-IV-6A</ENAMEX> was found to induce progressive,
          irreversible <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">flaccid</TIMEX> paralysis at the dose of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1 Î¼g/100</ENAMEX> mg
          per larva of 
          Heliothis virescens. Neither of
          these fractions induced any significant toxic symptoms in
          blowfly larvae or <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. This fraction was further
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">purified</ENAMEX> to apparent homogeneity by microbore <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPLC</ENAMEX> and
          the purity was confirmed by capillary electrophoresis
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). This fraction is estimated to account for
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.026%</NUMEX> of the total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> content of the dry <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">venom</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Structural analysis
          The molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mass</ENAMEX> of the peptide <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">toxin</ENAMEX> determined by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">ESI-MS</ENAMEX> was 3856.7Da (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) which is in agreement with
          the molecular mass calculated from the amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>
          sequence when the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">toxin</ENAMEX> is in its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">native</ENAMEX> form with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
          disulfide <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridges</ENAMEX> as observed in other similar toxins. An
          examination of multiple sequence alignment with known
          insect toxins using BLAST search [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] revealed that
          ButaIT <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">toxin</ENAMEX> shows considerable homology (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>) with
          short insect toxins, and shows highest percentage
          identity with peptide I (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">68%</NUMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">LQH-8/6</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">68%</NUMEX>) followed
          by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">neurotoxin P2</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">66%</NUMEX>), chlorotoxin (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">64%</NUMEX>), insectotoxin
          I5A (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60%</NUMEX>), insect <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">toxin</ENAMEX> I5 (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60%</NUMEX>) and insectotoxin II
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">52%</NUMEX>) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 22 23 24 25 26 27</NUMEX> ] .
          Toxins of buthid <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">venoms</ENAMEX> constitute a family of closely
          related peptides which could be classified into several
          structurally related peptides depending on their amino
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . Although the information available on the
          mode of action of these toxins is limited, it appears
          that different short toxins exhibit considerable
          diversity in their physiological mechanisms in spite of
          their structural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homology</ENAMEX>. For example Fazal 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX> , [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] reported that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">peptide</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">I</ENAMEX> is related to neurophysin, agglutinins [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29 30</NUMEX>
          ] and other peptides of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-disulfide core family
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">toxin</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agglutinin</ENAMEX> fold. The neurotoxin <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P2</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ammo</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">acids</ENAMEX>), another short <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">toxin</ENAMEX> and a structural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homologue</ENAMEX> of
          short <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">insectotoxin II</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>, shows toxicity towards 
          Sarcophaga falculata and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">crustaceans</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] . Chlorotoxin, isolated from 
          Leiurus quinquestriatus
          haebraeus, shows <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cl</ENAMEX> -channel-blocking activity and
          causes paralysis due to the inhibition of structurally
          related <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">anion channels</ENAMEX> such as the extrajunctional
          channels of arthropod muscles [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . It has also been
          reported that the short insectotoxin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">I5A</ENAMEX> may act on a
          "<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glutamate</ENAMEX> receptor of the postsynaptic membrane" [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ]
          . Although no specific experimental evidence is available
          on the mode of action of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ButaIT</ENAMEX>, it is assumed that
          ButaIT exerts similar ion <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> blocking activity as
          that of other short insect toxins. However a detailed
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">physiological</ENAMEX> and pharmacological analysis is necessary
          to define the exact mechanism of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ButaIT</ENAMEX> in spite of its
          high sequence and structural homology with other insect
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">toxins</ENAMEX>.
          Considering the high degree of sequence similarity, it
          is presumed that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ButaIT</ENAMEX> will have a similar 3-D structure
          to that of other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">short toxins</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">3-D</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> of
          several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">short toxins</ENAMEX> such as charybdotoxin (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ChTX</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ]
          , iberiotoxin (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IbTx</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] , kaliotoxin (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KxTx</ENAMEX>) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32 33</NUMEX> ]
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">margatoxin</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MgTx</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] , maurotoxin [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] , agitoxin
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AgTx</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] , noxiustoxin (NTX) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">PiL</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] ,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">insectotoxin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">I5A</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">LQH-8/6</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] and chlorotoxin
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] have been determined by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NMR</ENAMEX> spectroscopy and X-ray
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">crystallography</ENAMEX>. A <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> model of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ButaIT</ENAMEX>, generated
          from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Swiss</ENAMEX>-model <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> modeling server based on the
          structural coordinates of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chlorotoxin</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">insectotoxin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">I5A</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] showed that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ButaIT</ENAMEX> adopts a
          typical core structure of scorpion toxins primarily
          composed of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> Î±-helix and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> Î²-strands with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
          disulfide <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridges</ENAMEX>, a feature similar to other toxins of
          similar size that act on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> +and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cl</ENAMEX> -channels [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 31 34</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38</NUMEX> ] . It is also evident from the data that disulfide
          bridge formation in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ButaIT</ENAMEX> likely follows a common motif,
          with covalent links between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">cysl6-cys32</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">cys5-cys27</ENAMEX>,
          cys20<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">-cys34</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">an additional disulfide</NUMEX> bridge between
          cys2 and cys 19 which cross-links the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal strand
          of the Î²-sheet to the Î±-helix. Experiments are underway
          to purify larger quantities of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ButaIT</ENAMEX> using baculovirus
          expression system in order to establish a refined
          structure/function relationship.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        Here we report the isolation of a short insecticidal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">toxin</ENAMEX> from the venom of 
        Mesobuthus tamulus. The most
        important characteristic of this novel <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">toxin</ENAMEX> is its
        specificity towards 
        Heliothis virescens, the tobacco
        budworm, a worldwide pest of numerous valuable <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crops</ENAMEX> such
        as <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">cotton</ENAMEX>. When expressed in baculovirus system as a
        biopesticide scorpion toxins offer the advantage of faster
        kill without chemical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insecticides</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . Although the
        safety of recombinant baculoviruses is less of a concern
        ButaIT offers an extra level of safety as a recombinant
        biopesticide due to its specificity to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tobacco</ENAMEX> budworm ion
        channels. Moreover this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">toxin</ENAMEX> can be utilized as a specific
        probe of tobacco <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">budworm ion channels</ENAMEX>. Chemical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>
        can be screened for the ability to displace <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ButaIT</ENAMEX> leading
        to the discovery of better <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pesticides</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Materials and Methods
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Toxin</ENAMEX> purification
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">crude</ENAMEX> venom of 
          Mesobuthus tamulus was purchased
          from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Haffkine Institute</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bombay</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>). Lyophilized
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">venom</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">50 mg</NUMEX>) was homogenized in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ml of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> mM ammonium
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">acetate</ENAMEX> (pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.4</NUMEX>) using <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Potter-Elvehjam</ENAMEX> homogenizer and
          the insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at
          15,000 rpm for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> min. An additional <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ml of ammonium
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">acetate</ENAMEX> was added to the pellet, the homogenization was
          repeated, the contents were centrifuged and the
          supernatant was collected. The above procedure was
          repeated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 to 5</NUMEX> times to maximize the yield of peptide
          toxins from the crude <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">venom</ENAMEX>. The supernatant fractions
          were pooled, passed through a pre-cycled <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CM-52</ENAMEX> column and
          eluted with a gradient of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.01</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> ammonium
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">acetate</ENAMEX> (pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.4</NUMEX>) at a flow rate of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ml</ENAMEX>/h using a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pharmacia</ENAMEX> peristaltic pump. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fractions</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3 ml</NUMEX>), were
          collected using a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BioRad</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Model 2110</ENAMEX>) fraction <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">collector</ENAMEX>.
          All the chromatographic separations were carried out at
          4Â°C. Individual fractions were monitored at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">280</NUMEX> nm using
          a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Shimadzu spectrophotometer</NUMEX> (UV <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2101</TIMEX> PC). The active
          fractions under the same absorbency peak were pooled and
          freeze dried. Chromatographic analysis of CM-fractions
          was done by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPLC</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Perkin-Elmer</ENAMEX> Series 410 pump) which was
          equipped with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">LC-235</ENAMEX> diode array detector. The UV
          measurements were performed simultaneously at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">215 and 280</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nm</ENAMEX>. A <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î</NUMEX>¼m particle <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">size Protein C4</ENAMEX> column (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">25 cm</NUMEX> Ã— <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.5</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mm ID; Vydac, Hesperia</ENAMEX>, CA, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>) was used in conjunction
          with a C4 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guard</ENAMEX> column cartridge. The column was
          maintained at room temperature (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">25Â°C</NUMEX>). Chromatographic
          peaks were integrated on an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Everex 386/20</ENAMEX> PC using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Omega</ENAMEX>
          software and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Perkin-Elmer GP-100</ENAMEX> graphics integrator. The
          freeze dried CM-fractions were resuspended in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> and
          aliquots of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1 mg</NUMEX> each were loaded onto <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the C4</TIMEX> reversed
          phase column equilibrated in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Solvent A</ENAMEX> (A= <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX>
          acetonitrile, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.1%</NUMEX> trifluroacetic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TFA</ENAMEX>). The
          individual <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> were eluted from the column with a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">linear</ENAMEX> gradient reaching <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60%</NUMEX> Solvent B (B= <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX>

          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ml/min.</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gradient</ENAMEX> system-I). All the fractions were
          collected, freeze dried and assayed for biological
          activity. The active fractions were further purified
          using a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Protein C4 Column</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Vydac 25 cm Ã— 4.6</NUMEX> mm <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ID</ENAMEX>)
          equilibrated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Solvent A</ENAMEX> (A= <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> acetonitrile; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.1%</NUMEX>
          heptafluorobutyric <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> (HFBA) and resolution of peaks
          was accomplished using gradient elution of solvent B (B=
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> acetonitrile; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.1%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HFBA</ENAMEX>) reaching <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60%</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">70 min</TIMEX> at a
          flow rate of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ml</ENAMEX>/min. (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Gradient system-II</ENAMEX>). Individual
          peaks were collected, lyophilized and used for bioassays.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> concentrations of the samples were determined
          using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BCA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein assay</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierce</ENAMEX>) with bovine serum
          albumin as the standard. Following <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPLC</ENAMEX> steps, the
          toxins were further purified using a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Reliasil</ENAMEX> C18
          reversed-phase column (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Michrom 10 cm Ã— 1</NUMEX> mm <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ID</ENAMEX>)on a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microbore HPLC</ENAMEX> system (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Michrom Bioresources Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>).
          The insect-selective <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">toxin</ENAMEX> was loaded onto <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the C18</TIMEX> column
          and eluted in a linear gradient of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10-60 %</NUMEX> Solvent B (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX>

          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Î¼l/min.</ENAMEX>
        
        
          Purity determination
          The purity of the toxins was evaluated by free
          solution capillary electrophoresis on an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Applied</ENAMEX>
          Biosystems capillary electrophoresis <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Model 270A</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">75</NUMEX>
          cm capillary was equilibrated for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4 minutes</TIMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> mM
          sodium citrate buffer (pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.9</NUMEX>) and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">toxin</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/ml)
          was loaded using vacuum for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 seconds</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Resolution of</ENAMEX>
          peaks were performed using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> mM sodium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">citrate</ENAMEX> buffer
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">pH 2.9</NUMEX>) at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> kV electric potential and the absorbance
          was monitored at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">215</NUMEX> nm.
        
        
          Mass spectrometry
          The molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mass</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ButaIT</ENAMEX> was determined using
          electrospray ionization mass spectrometry on a <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">VG</ENAMEX>/Fisons
          Quattro-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BD</ENAMEX> mass spectrometer (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VG Biotech, Altrincham</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">UK</ENAMEX>). The delivery of mobile phase (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50% acetonitrile/0.05%</NUMEX>
          formic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">v/v</ENAMEX>) was performed with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ISCO Î¼LC-500</ENAMEX> syringe
          pump at a flow rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5 Î¼l/min.</ENAMEX> The purified toxin
          collected from microbore <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPLC</ENAMEX> was analyzed by direct flow
          injection of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î¼l</NUMEX>. The spectral analysis was done in a
          positive ion mode at a capillary voltage of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">+3.5</NUMEX> kV, a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cone</ENAMEX> voltage of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V</ENAMEX> and at a source temperature of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">70Â°C</TIMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spectra</ENAMEX> were scanned over the range of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">200-2000 m/z</ENAMEX> at a
          rate of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> sec/scan ; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> scans were combined using the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VGMCA</ENAMEX> acquisition mode. The molecular weight of the toxin
          was determined using the maximum entropy deconvolution
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">algorithm</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MaxEnt</ENAMEX>) to transform the range of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">650/1500 m/z</ENAMEX>
          to give a true mass scale spectrum. The mass calibration
          was performed using heart <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">myoglobin</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma</ENAMEX>)
        
        
          Bioassay of toxins
          The individual lyophilized fractions were dissolved in
          deionized <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, and an appropriate concentration of each
          fraction was injected into <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> instar 
          Heliothis virescens (tobacco
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">budworm</ENAMEX>) and last instar larvae of 
          Sarcophaga falculata (blowfly). The
          neurotoxic symptoms in the larvae were observed
          continuously for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 minutes</TIMEX> and also after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hr.</TIMEX>
          post-injection. Complete immobility or paralysis was
          taken as an indication for the neurotoxic activity in
          insect larvae. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Each fraction</TIMEX> was also injected
          subcutaneously into <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> in order to check for any
          mammalian toxicity.
        
        
          Sequence determination
          The purified <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ButaIT</ENAMEX> was reduced and carboxymethylated
          by incubating in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M</ENAMEX> guanidine hydrochloride, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX>
          Tris-HCl (pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.3</NUMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EDTA</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> mM dithiothreitol for
