        Material and methods
        
          Study area and study population
          This Study was undertaken in two Primary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Health</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Centre's</ENAMEX> (PHC) of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">district Mandla</ENAMEX>. The entire <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">undulating</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">hilly</NUMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> are generally located
          on the slopes of the hillocks or on hill tops adjoining
          perennial streams. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inhabitants</ENAMEX> are (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">gond</ENAMEX> ethnic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tribe</ENAMEX>) illiterate, poorly clothed, health ignorant and
          work in forest or <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">road</ENAMEX> construction work etc. An outbreak
          of 
          P. falciparum was recorded in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bizadandi PHC</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX> (unpublished
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">observation</ENAMEX>), while in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Narayanganj PHC</ENAMEX> in
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . Appropriate intervention measures were
          undertaken in both the areas by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Anti Malaria</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Programme</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N.A.M.P</ENAMEX>) which are described previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ]
          . Briefly <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> rounds of focal spraying with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDT</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 g/m 2</ENAMEX>)
          along with prompt surveillance and treatment to bring the
          incidence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX> under control.
          For monitoring the impact of intervention measures in
          these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PHC</ENAMEX>'s, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">aged 2-10</TIMEX> yrs with and without
          fever were examined for spleen enlargement [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] in
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> of each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PHC</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">autumn season</TIMEX>
          (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>), by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> medical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">specialist</ENAMEX> by
          establishing a mobile field <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinic</ENAMEX> after obtaining
          informed consent from their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>. Treatment was given
          when appropriate as per <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Indian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">N.A.M.P.</ENAMEX> The study is
          approved by ethic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committee</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Malaria Research Centre</ENAMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">I.C.M.R</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Delhi</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sampling</ENAMEX> and data analysis
          From these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> thick blood smears were prepared
          from finger prick and read by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">technician</ENAMEX> unaware of the
          spleen results. Parasites were counted against <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> white
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood cells</ENAMEX> and converted into counts/Î¼l assuming the
          average count is <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8000</TIMEX> Î¼l. Simultaneously, rapid tests
          were performed by a field lab attendant after only a
          brief on the spot training according to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">manufacturer</ENAMEX>'s instructions taking <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 30 minutes</TIMEX> to
          provide one result without reference to the results of
          the thick smear and spleen. The thick smears were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">re</ENAMEX>-examined to discard a false negative results, combined
          infections or misdiagnosis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> by an experienced
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">technician</ENAMEX> who was blinded to the previous results of
          thick smears. The figures for specificity, sensitivity
          and predictive values were calculated as described
          previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] using microscopy as gold standard.
          Briefly, sensitivity was calculated as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">TP</ENAMEX> / (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TP</ENAMEX> + <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FN</ENAMEX>),
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">specificity</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">TN</ENAMEX> /(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TN</ENAMEX> + <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FP</ENAMEX>), the positive predictive
          values (PPV) as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">TP</ENAMEX> / (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TP</ENAMEX> + <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FP</ENAMEX>), and the negative
          predictive values (NPV) as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">TN</ENAMEX> / (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FN</ENAMEX> + <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TN</ENAMEX>). The test
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">accuracy</ENAMEX>, the proportion of all tests that gave correct
          result, was defined as (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TP</ENAMEX> + <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TN</ENAMEX>) / numbers of all tests.
          The mixed infection of 
          P. vivax and 
          P. falciparum are treated as
          falciparum cases for the purpose of analysis. Likewise,
          the instances of gametocytes only are classified as false
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">positives</ENAMEX> since gametocytes neither cause <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> nor
          require treatment with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> stage schizonticidal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Z</ENAMEX>-test was used for comparison between
          proportions.
        
      
      
        Results
        Spleen examination of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">199 and 150</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> respectively
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Narayanganj</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bizadandi Primary Health Centres</ENAMEX> (PHC)
        are shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>. The spleen rate among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> who
        lived in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Narayanganj PHC</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">78%</NUMEX>) was
        significantly higher (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 0.0001</ENAMEX>) than that among
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bizadandi</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">24%</NUMEX>). Fever was found in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16.1</NUMEX> and
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.3 %</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Narayanganj</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bizadandi PHC</ENAMEX>'s
        respectively without spleen enlargement. The sensitivity
        and specificity of spleen in detecting <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX> infections
        were <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">57 and 74 %</NUMEX> respectively (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). The positive
        predictive value (PPV) <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">73%</NUMEX>, negative predictive value (NPV)
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">59%</NUMEX> and accuracy were <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">65%</NUMEX>. On the contrary, fever without
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">spleen</ENAMEX> had relatively high sensitivity of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">84%</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> <
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.001</NUMEX>) in detecting <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX> infections though specificity
        is significantly lower (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">62%</NUMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPV</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPV</ENAMEX> and accuracy
        were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">79</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">96 and 64%</NUMEX> respectively.
        The performance of rapid test vs thick smears are shown
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>. A good agreement was found indicating high
        sensitivity of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">91%</NUMEX> which is significantly higher than that
        of spleen (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 0.0001</ENAMEX>). However, specificity was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">79.6%</NUMEX>,
        which is not significant when compared with specificity of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">spleen</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>). The PPV <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">79%</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 0.05</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPV</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">91 %</NUMEX> (P
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.0001</NUMEX>) and accuracy <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">85%</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 0.0001</ENAMEX>) were all
        significantly higher when compared with their respective
        values of spleen. In all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> cases showed positive reaction
        by rapid test for 
        P. falciparum while <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood smears</ENAMEX> were
        negative for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria parasite</ENAMEX>. A prolonged re-examination
        of these slides who were positive by the rapid test, but
        apparently had negative slides, did not reveal the presence
        of 
        P. falciparum asexual parasites.
        Further of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> with 
        P. falciparum infection not detected
        by rapid test, not all had low parasitaemia: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> had
        parasite densities between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60-318/Î¼l</TIMEX>, but the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> others
        had <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">densities</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 600-1000/Î¼l</TIMEX>. Out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> gametocytes of
        
        P. falciparum, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">only 8</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">57%</NUMEX>) were
        positive by rapid test.
        In addition, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> with 
        P. vivax as detected by microscopy
        (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2795.81 Â± 3.58/(Î¼l</NUMEX>) were found positive for 
        P. falciparum by rapid test.
      
      
        Discussion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Malaria</ENAMEX> diagnosis, is often made on the basis of
        presumptive symptoms although this is alarmingly inaccurate
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16 1</NUMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the earliest methods used for
        estimation of the amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX> in a given locality is
        that of determining the proportion of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> with a
        palpable enlargement of the spleen. This method introduced
        by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dempster</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1848</TIMEX> is commonly used although it
        is admittedly a rough index for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX> diagnosis and
        assessment [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . However, it is still considered a
        diagnostic aid to every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX> as the spleen rate is
        easier to obtain than the parasite rate [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] .
        In this study large number of cases with enlarged spleen
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Narayanganj PHC</ENAMEX> were asymptomatic, of which fairly large
        number were having <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX> parasites. Thus, in this
        population a positive correlation between <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX> and
        splenomegaly was observed as recorded elsewhere [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 19</NUMEX> ] .
        However, it requires the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">services</ENAMEX> of a medical specialist
        who is not certain whether the spleen is entirely due to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX>. On the contrary, rapid test indicate the presence
        of 
        P. falciparum easily and accurately
        and since it requires no <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX> or technical equipment,
        a diagnostic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> can be set up in the most remote
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">areas</ENAMEX> and in the most rudimentary way which makes it ideal
        for monitoring large scale control programmes in areas
        where <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX> is a serious problem. This diagnostic test
        also gives the general practitioner a means of immediate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">diagnosis</ENAMEX>, which would overcome the usual delay associated
        with dependence on medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">laboratories</ENAMEX>. Thus rapid test
        could be a better diagnostic method in 
        P. falciparum <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX> than spleen and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microscopy</ENAMEX>.
        The fact that a small proportion of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6%</NUMEX>)
        without 
        P. falciparum parasites in thick
        smears were demonstrated to have detectable <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HRP-2 antigen</ENAMEX>
        does not reduce the value of the rapid test. Positive
        results on the rapid test, which can not be verified
        microscopically have been suggested to be due to
        circulating 
        P. falciparum <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HRP-2 antigen</ENAMEX> following
        treatment [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] or from sequestered parasites [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] .
        In <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4%</NUMEX> cases the rapid test gave false negative results
        compared to the thick smear. Such cases may not have
        sufficient <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> for detection by rapid
        test. We have estimated in our <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> study that the
        threshold parasitaemia for detection by Determine test to
        be <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 500 parasites Î</NUMEX>¼l [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . However, in this study
        rapid test failed to detect 3 
        P. falciparum <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">â‰¤ 1000 Î</ENAMEX>¼l
        of parasites. Unexplained false negative results on the
        rapid test have been reported in many studies [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 23</NUMEX> ] and
        rarely even with very high parasitaemia [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 25</NUMEX> ] .
        Further, during this study though we did not find the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with rheumatoid factor, this may need to be
        investigated further in other <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX> endemic areas as a
        relatively high false positive rate with Determine rapid
        test was observed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with rheumatoid factor in
        earlier study [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] .
        Interestingly, in central <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> the largest <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, also contributing highest number of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX> cases
        (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">23%</NUMEX>) in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] , the usual practice under NAMP
        is to provide radical treatment (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chloroquine</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Primaquine</ENAMEX>) to all <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">fever</ENAMEX> cases during monsoon and post
        monsoon season in tribal <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> due to inaccessibility.
        However, as a results of the emergence of drug resistant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chloroquine</ENAMEX> (CQ) resistant 
        P. falciparum infections are treated
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CQ</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CQ</ENAMEX> is still the first line of treatment in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX>, these infections may be partially controlled with
        the persistence of low grade <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">parasitaemia</ENAMEX> in the peripheral
        blood [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . Such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> experience no symptoms or
        barely symptomatic infections [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28 29</NUMEX> ] . We contend that
        the asymptomatic infections which were recorded in this
        study were mainly infections of this type. These
        asymptomatic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carriers</ENAMEX> in remote <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">villages</ENAMEX> are putting a
        strain on <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX> control activities. Since the number of
        febrile <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> presenting at most peripheral health
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">facilities</ENAMEX> in central <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> far too high to test each
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> for the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Plasmodium species</ENAMEX>, hence
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">malaria</ENAMEX> control programme policy is to provide fever
        radical treatment. Thus collection and examination of blood
        smears from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">asymptomatic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> is not possible. This
        opens new possibilities for rapid screening of communities
        at risk particularly pregnant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30 31</NUMEX> ]
        in whom correct diagnosis and treatment is especially
        important [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] .
        However, a diagnostic test which is to be used in
        peripheral areas of developing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> has to be simple and
        fast to perform by unskilled <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX>. While comparing with
        other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HRP-2</ENAMEX>, Determine test has some advanced features. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ParaSight</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX> test requires <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> steps and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 Î¼l</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX>,
        followed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICT</ENAMEX> which required <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> steps and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î¼l</NUMEX> of blood
        while Determine assay require <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> steps and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 Î¼l</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX>.
        Though final reading time is designed as <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 min</TIMEX>, which may
        be a disadvantage particularly during <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX> outbreak,
        generally a clear red line in patient <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bar</ENAMEX> is seen within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> in mild to moderately parasitaemic cases. In our
        study the reliability of field <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">worker</ENAMEX> in reading test
        results was excellent after only brief on-site training.
        Finally, the application of the rapid test in the programme
        will be determined by cost effective analysis. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> at highest risk from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX> are
        mainly poorest and the most disadvantaged [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . The price
        of the test varies with quantity and source of purchase [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX> ] . For example the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ParaSight F</ENAMEX> test sells for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">US$ 1.20</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/</ENAMEX> test in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Uganda</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] , <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">US$ 2.25</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Africa</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ]
        and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">US$ 10-13</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. The costs of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICT pf</ENAMEX> tests
        ranges from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">US$ 1.80</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/</ENAMEX> test in developing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ]
        to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">US$ 27</NUMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> test in developed world. These prices
        appear prohibitive at first sight in a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX>, which only
        spends <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a few dollars</NUMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>/year for health care. However
        the picture may look different when the total costs to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">disease</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> are considered for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> and the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">programme</ENAMEX>. The cost effectiveness advantage of rapid test
        in the long term is the reduction of mistreatment in terms
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>, costs, toxicity and development of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</NUMEX> ] . An important advantage of the availability of the
        rapid test that it does not depend on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">just one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> but
        can be performed by all staff <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the health
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clinic</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Conclusions
        In a situation like ours where <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory facilities</ENAMEX> are
        poor or non-existent, rapid test is the best option to
        support <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX> diagnosis for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">case management</ENAMEX> in malaria
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> programme. However, persistent positive reactions
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">upto 2 weeks</TIMEX> following treatment [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] would not justify
        the introduction of rapid test as a screening test by
        village health <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX> in the region. Since the sensitivity
        of the rapid tests remains high on treated patients
        therefore, it will be important to take <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> history
        into consideration during routine usage of the rapid tests.
        Furthermore, in the study area, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> are also subject to
        other 
        Plasmodium infections i.e. 
        P. vivax, which are less common and
        initially indistinguishable. These non-falciparum
        plasmodial infections have important therapeutic and
        prognostic implications. Thus a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> generation of rapid
        test's are required which are intended to detect and
        distinguish 
        P. vivax from 
        P. falciparum.
