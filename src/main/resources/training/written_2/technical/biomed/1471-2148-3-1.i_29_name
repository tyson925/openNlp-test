        Rates of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> evolution vary greatly and may be
        influenced by a variety of factors. Recently, it has been
        demonstrated that the magnitude of the fitness effects
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with deleterious mutations in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-coding
        genes (i.e. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>' dispensability) correlates with rates
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> evolution [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] . Essential <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> or those
        that are less dispensable to an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> tend to evolve
        slower than those that are more dispensable. It has also
        been suggested that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>' evolutionary rates are
        determined by the proportion of amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acids</ENAMEX> that are
        critical to their function [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . According to this
        intuitively plausible notion, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with a greater
        fraction of amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid residues</ENAMEX> that play an essential role
        in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>'s function are predicted to evolve slower
        than those with a smaller fraction of such crucial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>. Consistent with this prediction, a negative
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">correlation</ENAMEX> has been reported between protein evolutionary
        rates, which were determined from evolutionary distances
        between orthologous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> from yeast 
        Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the
        nematode 
        Caenorhabditis elegans , and the
        number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-protein interactions</ENAMEX> (i.e., physical
        interactions determined, primarily, using the yeast
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-hybrid <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">system</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are involved in [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . Yeast
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that have a large number of interacting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partners</ENAMEX>
        were found to have evolved slower, on average, than those
        with fewer interacting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partners</ENAMEX>, and this was presumed to
        be due to the fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with more interacting
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> have a greater fraction of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> directly
        involved in function. However, these same data indicate
        that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 6%</NUMEX> of the variance in evolutionary rates is
        explained by the variance in the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-protein
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interactions</ENAMEX>, suggesting that the influence of the number
        of interacting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> evolutionary rates might
        not be substantial. We sought to further investigate this
        phenomenon by examining the relationship between the number
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-protein</ENAMEX> interacting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> and protein
        evolutionary rates for the yeasts 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> cerevisiae and 
        Schizosaccharomyces pombe as well as
        for the proteobacteria 
        Helicobacter pylori and 
        Camplyobacter jejuni .
      
      
        Results and Discussion
        
          Evolutionary rates and protein-protein
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interactions</ENAMEX>: yeast
          A total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,879</NUMEX> pairs of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">orthologous proteins</ENAMEX>, one
          from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> cerevisiae and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. pombe</ENAMEX> , were identified (see
          Methods), and for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,004</NUMEX> of these, there was data on
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-protein</ENAMEX> interactions of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> cerevisiae <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIPS</ENAMEX>
          database [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . For these <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,004 orthologous</NUMEX> pairs, the
          number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-protein</ENAMEX> interactions detected for the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> cerevisiae <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> was plotted
          against the calculated substitution rates between
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">orthologs</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1a</NUMEX>). As with a previous survey that
          compared conserved 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> cerevisiae and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans orthologs [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] , there
          is a negative correlation between the number of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-protein interactions</ENAMEX> and the evolutionary rates.
          However, although this correlation is statistically
          significant (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>), the slope of the linear trend line
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">y = -0.012</ENAMEX>) fit to the data by <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">least</NUMEX> squares regression
          as well as the small r 2value (r <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0065</NUMEX>) suggest that
          the influence of the number of interacting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> on
          rates of evolution is minor at best. Specifically, the r
          2value indicates that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 1%</NUMEX> of the variation in
          substitution rates between orthologous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> is
          explained by the variation in the number of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-protein interactions</ENAMEX>. Furthermore, when only the
          most conserved (≥ <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40%</NUMEX> sequence identity), and thus most
          reliably identified, pairs of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">orthologous proteins</ENAMEX> were
          considered, the slope of the linear trend line as well as
          the r 2value decreased and the statistical significance
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">disappeared</ENAMEX> (Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1band Table 1</ENAMEX>). To account for the
          possibility that linear regression does not adequately
          reflect the structure of the data and the observed low
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">correlation</ENAMEX> is due to a non-linear relationship between
          the number of interactions and evolutionary rate of a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, we also calculated the rank correlation
          coefficients for these quantities. Under this approach,
          no statistically significant correlation was observed for
          either of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> analysed data sets (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
          It is tempting to speculate that the difference
          between the results obtained here and those reported
          previously [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] can be attributed to the difference in
          the evolutionary relationships between the pairs of
          species compared in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> studies. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> compared
          here, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> cerevisiae and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. pombe</ENAMEX> , are much more closely
          related than 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> cerevisiae and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> elegans , and orthologous
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are likely to be more reliably inferred between
          the closely related genomes. However, we also performed
          comparisons for pairs of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">orthologous proteins</ENAMEX> identified
          between the more distantly related 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> cerevisiae and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elegans</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] and no significant
          relationship between evolutionary rates and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-protein interactions</ENAMEX> was observed (data not
          shown).
        
        
          Long-term evolutionary conservation and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-protein interactions</ENAMEX>: yeast
          To examine the relationship between <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-protein
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interactions</ENAMEX> and evolutionary conservation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>
          over longer periods of time, the numbers of interactions
          for 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> cerevisiae <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> were
          assessed against the taxonomic distribution of their
          homologs, which were detected using BLAST searches of the
          Genbank non-redundant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> database with expect value
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">≤ 10 -3.</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Five</NUMEX> distinct levels of taxonomic distribution
          categories, each including taxa that are successively
          more distant from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. cerevisiae</ENAMEX> , were considered: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>
          - hits only to ascomycetes, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> - hits to non-ascomycete
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fungi</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> - hits to metazoa and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> - hits to
          non-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crown-group</ENAMEX> eukaryotes, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> - hits to archaea and/or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>. The broader the taxonomic distribution of
          homologs of a 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> cerevisiae <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> the more
          evolutionarily conserved it is considered to be. Each 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> cerevisiae <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> was assigned
          a taxonomic distribution category, and this value was
          compared to the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-protein</ENAMEX> interactions
          reported for the given <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. Correlation between these
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> features of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> cerevisiae <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> was not
          statistically significant (r <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.007</NUMEX>, p = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.39</NUMEX>). Thus,
          as with the comparison between evolutionary rates and the
          number of interactions, no substantial relationship
          between long-term evolutionary conservation of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> cerevisiae <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and the
          number of interactions was found.
        
        
          Evolutionary rates and protein-protein
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interactions</ENAMEX>: bacteria
          High throughput analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-protein
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interactions</ENAMEX> has also been conducted [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] on the
          proteobacterium 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H.</ENAMEX> pylori (the causative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">gastric ulcers</ENAMEX>), for which complete genome sequences of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> strains are available [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9</NUMEX> ] . Thus it is possible
          to assess the effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-protein</ENAMEX> interactions on
          the rates of evolution over much shorter periods of time
          (within <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>) compared to the analysis of the yeast
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> described above. Towards this end, orthologs
          between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> completely sequenced 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H.</ENAMEX> pylori strains were identified
          and the substitution rates between pairs of orthologous
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> were calculated (see Methods). The number of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-protein interactions</ENAMEX> was plotted against the
          amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> substitution rates and no significant
          relationship between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> was detected (Figure 2aand
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Table 1</ENAMEX>). The same conclusion was reached when the rank
          correlation coefficient was determined (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). In this
          case, the lack of correlation between evolutionary rates
          and the number of interacting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> might simply be
          due to the small amount of evolutionary diversification
          that has occurred since the two 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H.</ENAMEX> pylori strains separated from
          their common ancestor. To evaluate this possibility,
          orthologous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> pairs were identified between 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H.</ENAMEX> pylori and a more distantly
          related <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacterium</ENAMEX>, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">jejuni</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . These two
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> are close enough (both belong to the epsilon
          subdivision of proteobacteria) to ensure accurate
          identification of orthologs, but distant enough for
          substantial sequence divergence to have accumulated
          between orthologs. Nevertheless, comparison between these
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> showed no discernable correlation between
          the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-protein interactions</ENAMEX> and the rates
          of substitution between orthologs, measured either
          directly or using the rank correlation approach (Figure
          2band <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          Yeast <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with the greatest number of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interactions</ENAMEX> appear to evolve slowly
          The observations described above seem to indicate that
          the number of interaction <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> a given <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> has
          does not make an important contribution to the
          evolutionary rate. One could speculate, however, that
          whatever minor correlation is seen (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1a, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2a</TIMEX>), is not
          spread evenly, as a miniscule difference in the
          evolutionary rates, among all <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, but rather
          reflects a substantial slowdown of evolution among a
          small fraction of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that have the greatest number
          of interactions. To test this hypothesis, we grouped
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> cerevisiae and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H.</ENAMEX> pylori into separate bins, with
          each bin containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> whose number of interactions
          fell within a given range. Comparison of the evolutionary
          rates for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in different bins showed that yeast
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in the bins with the greatest number of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interactions</ENAMEX>, on average, evolved slower than the bulk of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3a). The difference was less than
          twofold even for the top bin, but was statistically
          significant for each of the top <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> bins or their
          combination (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with a large number
          of interactions placed in the top bins comprise <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 6.5%</NUMEX>
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast proteins</ENAMEX>. In contrast, for the bulk of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX>, which have a small to moderate number of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interactions</ENAMEX>, there did not seem to be any dependence at
          all between the number of interactions and the
          evolutionary rates (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3a). 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H.</ENAMEX> pylori <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with the
          greatest number of interactions also appear to have
          evolved slower on average between strains than the
          majority of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. However, the difference was not
          significant and this effect was not seen in the
          comparison of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H.</ENAMEX> pylori and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> jejuni orthologs (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2and Fig</ENAMEX>
          3b,3c).
        
      
      
        Discussion and conclusions
        The hypothesis that a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>'s rate of evolution is
        determined by the fraction of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> that are critical to
        its function, and this, in turn, is likely to be
        proportional to the number of interactions a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> is
        involved in, seems to make perfectly good sense. Indeed, a
        recent report is consistent with this idea in suggesting
        that the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-protein</ENAMEX> interactions
        significantly affects rates of evolution [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . However,
        upon investigation of this relationship at multiple levels
        of evolutionary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatedness</ENAMEX>, we found that there was only a
        slight correlation, at best, between evolutionary rates and
        the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-protein interactions</ENAMEX>. In fact,
        examination of the actual data presented in support of the
        previous claim of a connection between the number of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interactions</ENAMEX> and evolutionary rates [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] also shows a weak
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">correlation</ENAMEX>, albeit greater than the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> observed in this
        study. Thus, differences in the number of interaction
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> seem to explain, at best, only a small part of the
        great variation of the evolutionary rates of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">encoded</ENAMEX> in each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genome</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] .
        Why does the number of interaction <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> apparently
        have only a slight effect on the evolutionary rate? The
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> and most obvious possibility to consider would be
        that the low quality of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-protein</ENAMEX> interaction data
        might obscure the signal. Indeed, a recent comparison of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-protein</ENAMEX> interaction data sets from high-throughput
        studies suggested that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than half</NUMEX> of all interactions
        determined by large scale experiments are likely to be
        false positives [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . However, at least for the yeast
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>, we relied on manually curated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-protein
        interaction data from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIPS</ENAMEX> database, which are expected
        to have a substantially lower error rate. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, one could
        speculate that, even if the majority of the analyzed
        interactions actually do occur, they are selectively
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">nearly</NUMEX>) neutral; the number of such real but functionally
        irrelevant interactions would not affect the rate of
        evolution. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, the possibility exists that, even if many
        of the observed interactions are functionally important
        and, by inference, the respective binding <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> are subject
        to purifying selection, the binding sites for different
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> tend to overlap such that the number of amino
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> in these sites increases only slowly with the
        increase in the numbers of interactions.
        The latter <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> possibilities are not incompatible with
        each other and with the other aspect of the observations
        reported here. We found that the small fraction of yeast
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that have the greatest number of interaction
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> do, on average, evolve slower than the bulk of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX>, which are involved in a moderate or small number
        of interactions. This effect was less pronounced, if
        observed at all, for 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H.</ENAMEX> pylori , but it has to be noticed
        that the top bins of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H.</ENAMEX> pylori interaction data included
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with fewer interactions than the respective bins
        in the yeast data (compare <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3b,3cand <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3a</ENAMEX>).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Protein-protein</ENAMEX> interactions form scale-free <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX>,
        which show the characteristic power-law distribution of the
        node degrees; simply put, there is a small number of highly
        connected <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> (hubs), whereas the majority have a
        small number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> (the most abundant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that are involved in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">just one</NUMEX> interaction) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14</NUMEX>
        ] . Scale-free <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> are highly tolerant to error
        (elimination of nodes at random) but are vulnerable to
        attack, i.e. elimination of the hubs [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] and, indeed, it
        has been found that the most highly connected <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in
        yeast interaction <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> tend to be essential [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] .
        This might explain the present findings, namely that a
        small number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast protein-protein</ENAMEX> interaction hubs
        evolve slowly due to strong purifying selection, whereas,
        for the great majority of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, there is no
        discernible connection between the number of interactions
        and evolutionary rates.

          Protein sets (proteomes) from the following pairs of
          complete genome sequences were compared in order to
          identify orthologous sequences:

          of the other analyzed <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> (or strain). Symmetrical
