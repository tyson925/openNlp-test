        Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past five years</TIMEX>, 
        in situ hybridization techniques
        employing tyramide amplification reagents have been
        developed and promise the potential detection of
        low/single-copy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nucleic acid sequences</ENAMEX>. However the
        increased sensitivity that tyramide amplification brings
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about</TIMEX> may also lead to problems of background staining that
        confound data interpretation. In this study factors that
        allow reproducible, sensitive, and clean biotinyl-tyramide
        based 
        in situ hybridization assay have been
        investigated. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) human
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">papillomavirus</ENAMEX> (HPV) positive cell-lines (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SiHa, HeLa</ENAMEX> and
        CaSki,) as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">FFPE cervical lesions</ENAMEX> (pre-invasive and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">invasive</ENAMEX>) infected with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPV</ENAMEX> have been used as model
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX>. In addition metaphase chromosome spreads prepared
        from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">SiHa</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> have been examined.

            air-drying, slides were immersed in these solutions in
            Coplin jars pre-heated to temperature in water <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">baths</ENAMEX>.
            After incubation, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coplin</ENAMEX> jars were removed from the
            water bath and slides immersed in sodium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">citrate</ENAMEX> or
            Tris-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCl</ENAMEX> and were allowed to sit in solution for a

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">predisposed</ENAMEX> to background staining. Cleanest results
            were obtained with a sodium citrate step. There was no

            Protease Unmasking
            Protease digestion was essential to enable target
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> detection with any of the above unmasking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aids</ENAMEX>.
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">proteases</ENAMEX> were tested: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">pepsin/0.2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M HCl</ENAMEX>,

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M HCl</ENAMEX> digest preceded by sodium citrate treatment
            yielded the cleanest and most sensitive detection of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">viral</ENAMEX> and chromosomal sequences. The pepsin solution
            was prepared by heating <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 mls</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M HCl</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">37Â°C</NUMEX> and
            then mixing in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> mg of pepsin (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P-7012</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma</ENAMEX>,
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">St Louis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">MO</ENAMEX>). Pepsin was allowed to dissolve for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>
            <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> then <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ml was mixed with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38</NUMEX> ml <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M HCl</ENAMEX> at
            room temperature (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">25Â°C</NUMEX>) to yield a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">100Î¼g</NUMEX>/ml solution.
            Slides were incubated with this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solution</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25Â°C</TIMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
            <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> (fixed cell lines) up to <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">35 minutes</TIMEX> (CIN)
            <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX>. The majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FFPE</ENAMEX> pathology specimens
            required <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15 minutes</TIMEX> digestion. Slides were then rinsed
            with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, washed in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> changes of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">/0</NUMEX><NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">.05%</NUMEX> Tween
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> for a total of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15 minutes</TIMEX> and then rinsed in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>.

            peroxide for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 minutes</TIMEX> as a precaution against
            endogenous peroxidase followed by water rinses for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>
            <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> and were then air-dried. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> proteases
            were tested in the absence of non-protease unmasking
            steps. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pepsin</ENAMEX> and proteinase <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> were tested with all
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> non-protease unmasking steps and protease <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VIII</ENAMEX> was
            only tested in combination with sodium citrate
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unmasking</ENAMEX>. Overall tissue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unmasking</ENAMEX> was found to be one
            of the most critical steps for sensitive detection.
          
          
            Post-digestion fixation
            Including post-digestion fixation steps with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4%</NUMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">paraformaldehyde</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methanol/acetic acid</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4:1</ENAMEX>) in the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NISH</ENAMEX> assay were investigated when pepsin or proteinase
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> were used with or without sodium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">citrate</ENAMEX>. No benefits
            to sensitivity or background cleanliness were
            identified.

            at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">pH 6.0</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.5</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.0</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.5</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.0</NUMEX> using a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pepsin</ENAMEX>/sodium
            citrate regimen. Otherwise the proteases used (with or

            at a concentration of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">400 ng/Î</ENAMEX>¼l hybridization mix was
            included when using an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HPV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX>. Sonicated salmon
            sperm <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma</ENAMEX>) at the same concentration was
            included when human sequence centromeric probes were
            used. A commercially available hybridization mix (DAKO
            S3305) was also assessed.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPV</ENAMEX> or centromeric plasmid was labeled with biotin
            by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">nick-</ENAMEX>translation (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Invitrogen Life Technologies</ENAMEX>,
            <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Carlsbad</ENAMEX>, CA). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nick-</ENAMEX>translation reactions were allowed
            to progress for different lengths of time to enable the
            effect of probe size to be examined. Size of heat
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">denatured</ENAMEX> (i.e. single strand) probe fragments was
            checked by agarose gel electrophoresis of denatured
            probe followed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern</ENAMEX> transfer and demonstration
            of biotin by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BluGene</ENAMEX> kit (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Invitrogen Life</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Technologies</ENAMEX>). Probes were purified through

            Absence of dextran <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sulfate</ENAMEX> resulted in background
            problems and at a concentration of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> sensitivity was
            significantly reduced. The tested range of formamide
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">concentrations</ENAMEX> had little effect on background
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">staining</ENAMEX>. Hybridization mixes prepared with STE
            invariably gave background problems. There was little
            difference between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSPE</ENAMEX> buffers. Hybridization
            mix pH was found to be important. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sensitivity</ENAMEX> was
            significantly reduced at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">pH < 7.0</NUMEX>. Background was
            significantly increased at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">pH > 7.5</NUMEX>. It was noted
            that the pH of a 2X <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSC</ENAMEX> solution diluted from 20X SSC

            signals. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sensitivity</ENAMEX> was significantly lowered when

            below < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX> in length. Probe concentration was
            important for sensitivity, which dropped noticeably
            when the concentration was below <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> ng<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/Î¼l</ENAMEX>. It was not
            possible to compensate for loss in sensitivity by

            Background-free results were obtained for all
            centromeric probes tested and most HPV type probes
            tested. However certain HPV probes such as that for
            type <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX> were consistently associated with non-specific
            background staining. This problem remained despite
            repeat preparation of plasmid by column extraction
            (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qiagen</ENAMEX>), repeat nick-translation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> to yield
            different sized fragments, and repeat <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">purifications</ENAMEX> of

            isopropanol precipitation. This suggests the staining
            is somehow related to the physical properties of the
            probe sequence structure and is not due to some
            unidentified contaminant. However this non-specific
            staining was virtually eliminated when the commercially
            supplied hybridization mix (DAKO) was used together
            with pH controlled post-hybridization washes (see
            below). A number of other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hybridization mix additives</ENAMEX>
            that may benefit sensitivity/background were not
            tested. These include ficoll, polyvinylpyrolidone,
            bovine serum albumin, (individually or together [i.e.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Denhardt</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reagent</ENAMEX>]), sodium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dodecyl sulfate</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tween</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>
            and <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Triton X-100</ENAMEX>. Hybridization <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mix</ENAMEX> is also available
            from other commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">companies</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BioGenex</ENAMEX>.
          
          
            Denaturation
            Hybridization <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mix</ENAMEX> was applied to sections and
            coverslips were sealed with rubber <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cement</ENAMEX>. Slides were
            placed into <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Terasaki plates</ENAMEX> containing <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 mls</ENAMEX> 5X <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSC</ENAMEX>.
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Terasaki</ENAMEX> plates were then placed onto a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 cm</NUMEX> thick
            aluminum block preheated in an oven set at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">95Â°C</TIMEX>.
            Terasaki plates were removed after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">17 minutes</TIMEX>. This
            form of denaturation was found to be marginally more
            effective than placing slides directly onto the heated
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">block</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 minutes</TIMEX>.
          
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Hybridization</ENAMEX> temperature and time
            Hybridization conditions and post-hybridization

            probe and its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX>. The melting temperature 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> is determined by a number of

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m t</ENAMEX>), having noted that the
            theoretical 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> (derived from analysis of solution

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> in HPV ISH assays using
            full-length probes, suggesting that hybridization

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> . After several studies [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7 8</NUMEX> ]
            it was concluded that the main difference between 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> and 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> tis (probably) due to the use of a
            different end-point for measurement (e.g. a chromogenic
            stain following application of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intermediary reagents</ENAMEX>)
            rather than biochemical alteration of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-DNA
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interactions</ENAMEX> (measured by spectrophotometry) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . It
            was also concluded that mismatched <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> targets should
            be removed using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">empirically</ENAMEX> derived post-hybridization
            washing conditions in order to achieve specificity and
            that appropriate conditions should be determined by
            experiment rather than calculated theoretically from 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> . In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a later</TIMEX> study <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Herrington</ENAMEX> 
            et al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] examined the ability
            of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ISH</ENAMEX> to discriminate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPV</ENAMEX> types using full-length
            plasmid probes. It was concluded that when using a high
            sensitivity system in which high-copy number infection
            is present then <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ISH</ENAMEX> can lead to erroneous typing data.
            Accordingly, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPV</ENAMEX> typing of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> in the present study
            was determined by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> assay and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hybridization</ENAMEX>/wash
            conditions were then optimized empirically for
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sensitivity</ENAMEX> and clean background using the appropriate
            HPV-type <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> as indicated following the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX>.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hybridizations</ENAMEX> (that included sonicated human placental
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> in the hybridization mix) were tested at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42Â°C</TIMEX> and
            37Â°C for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 hours</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">overnight</TIMEX>. Highest sensitivity and
            cleanest background was obtained with <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">overnight</TIMEX> 37Â°C
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">incubations</ENAMEX> followed by high-stringency washes (see
            below).
          
          
            Controls
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nick</ENAMEX>-translated biotin-labeled <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">pUC18</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plasmid</ENAMEX> was
            used as a control for non-specific probe binding and
            HPV probes were also applied to normal cervical
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tissues</ENAMEX>. It was confirmed that a plasmid vector probe
            did not result in hybridization signal with an
            HPV-positive lesion and that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HPV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> did not result
            in signal with normal tissue.
          
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post-Hybridization</ENAMEX> Washes
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSC</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSPE</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STE</ENAMEX> buffers at pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.0</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.5</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.0</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.5</NUMEX> and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.0</NUMEX> were tested as variables of the protocol listed in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>. After pealing away rubber <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cement</ENAMEX>, slides were
          immersed in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2X</NUMEX> buffer<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">/0</NUMEX><NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">.05%</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tween 20</TIMEX> and coverslips were

          As with hybridization mix, wash buffer pH was an
          important factor for a clean result. Background tended to
          occur at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">pH6.0</NUMEX> and at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">pH8.0</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sensitivity</ENAMEX> was reduced at
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION"><</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pH7.0</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STE</ENAMEX> buffer gave background problems possibly
          because the pH of this buffer tended to decrease as
          temperature increased whereas <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSPE</ENAMEX> better
          retained pH. The use or otherwise of formamide did not
          alter background-staining status. HPV signal in SiHa
          cells remained detectable washing in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">up to 0.2X</TIMEX> SSC<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">/0</NUMEX><NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">.05%</NUMEX>

          Detection of Biotin
          
            Chromogen
            Peroxidase was demonstrated using either DAB
            [<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,3</NUMEX>'<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">-diaminobenzidene</ENAMEX>] (DAKO) or AEC
            [<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole</ENAMEX>] (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma</ENAMEX>). Use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AEC</ENAMEX> was of
            particular benefit in avoiding non-specific background
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">staining</ENAMEX>. In addition the signal from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AEC</ENAMEX> tended to be
            more discrete than that from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAB</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> copies of HPV
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">SiHa</ENAMEX> cells were readily detectable using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AEC</ENAMEX>,
            which was applied for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 - 10 minutes</TIMEX>. A more intense
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stain</ENAMEX> was obtained with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAB</ENAMEX>, which was applied for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-3
            <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX>. Tissues were counterstained with hematoxylin.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'Punctate</ENAMEX>' signals indicative of integration (see
            discussion) were demonstrated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CaSki, HeLa, SiHa</ENAMEX>,
            and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carcinoma samples</ENAMEX> (Figure 1A,1B<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">,1C,1</NUMEX>D<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,1</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E,1F</ENAMEX>).
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'Diffuse</ENAMEX>' signals (indicative of episomal HPV),
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'diffuse</ENAMEX>' and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">'punctate'</ENAMEX>, or 'punctate' signals alone
            were demonstrated amongst pre-invasive lesion samples
            (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2A,2</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Band 2C</ENAMEX>). These <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> were deliberately
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>- or under-digested. There was no evidence that
            punctate signals were a consequence of inadequate
            tissue unmasking. Punctate signal patterns in a tissue
            unmasked at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> set of digestion conditions continued
            to be detectable as punctate signal under more severe
            unmasking conditions. Similarly diffuse signal patterns
            did not appear as punctate when tissue was subject to
            less severe unmasking conditions. Aneusomic chromosome
            counts were also demonstrated following assay with
            centromeric probes (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2D</NUMEX>).

            similarly processed apart from incubation with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AEC</ENAMEX> or
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAB</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> prefer AEC because:

            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hands DAB</ENAMEX> generally tended to
            result in background staining using the optimized
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">protocol</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>) or the protocol supplied with the
            GenPoint kit. Background was found to be present even
            after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 minute</TIMEX> substrate incubation. This staining has
            a 'grainy' appearance that could be mistaken for
            punctate signals. Punctate-like signals were found even
            with normal cervix hybridized with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HPV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> (Figure
            4B) or lesion hybridized with plasmid vector control
            probe (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7B</NUMEX>), and were commonly found congregated
            around nuclei circumferences and also in cytoplasm
            (Figures <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3B</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4B</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5B</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6B</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7B</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8B</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9B</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10B</TIMEX>).
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AEC</ENAMEX> did not result in this type of staining.
            Leaving specimens in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AEC</ENAMEX> for up to <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20 minutes only</TIMEX>
            tended to result in a pinkish blush to tissues and not
            the 'grainy' background obtained with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAB</ENAMEX>. Therefore it
            was easy to interpret signals obtained using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AEC</ENAMEX> as
            genuine HPV-related correlates whereas with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAB</ENAMEX>,
            diffuse signals were easy to interpret, but the
            interpretation of punctate signals was generally open
            to question. Occasionally non-specific staining was
            noted with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AEC</ENAMEX> at the surperficial layers of normal
            epithelium demonstrating parakeratosis.

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">paraformaldehyde/PBS</ENAMEX> then rinsed with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.2%</NUMEX> glycine / <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> and water then air-dried. Hybridization, wash and
          detection conditions were then applied as above except
          that chromosomes were denatured by placing slides
          directly onto a heating block set at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">75Â°C</TIMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> min. HPV
          16 signal was not detected by staining with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AEC</ENAMEX> or DAB.
          Detection conditions were modified to enable fluorescent
          assay, which successfully revealed integrated signal.
          Following application of primary
          streptavidin-peroxidase (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1:300</ENAMEX>) and biotinyl-tyramide,
          streptavidin-FITC (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">S3762</ENAMEX>) was applied at a final
          concentration of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0125</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/ml diluted in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">/0</NUMEX><NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">.05%</NUMEX> Tween
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> and incubated at room temperature with the chromosome
          spreads for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 minutes</TIMEX>. After staining with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAPI</ENAMEX>,
          chromosomes were visualized by fluorescence
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microscopy</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPV</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> has been shown to be integrated at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13q21-q31</TIMEX> by
          
          in situ hybridization analysis with
          3H-labeled <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> and chromosome identification by Geimsa
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">staining</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] and by detection of biotin-labeled HPV
          probe detected with avidin-FITC, which enabled detection
          of integrated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPV</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">metaphase</TIMEX> spreads as a 'pin-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prick</ENAMEX>'
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SiHa</ENAMEX> cell line is aneusomic and has
          been found to contain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">66 - 72</NUMEX> chromosomes, but to be
          diploid for the acrocentric chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] .
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metaphase</ENAMEX> spreads hybridized with biotin-labeled
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HPV-16</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> detected with biotinyl-tyramide and
          streptavidin-FITC, consistently demonstrated intense
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> in the central <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> of the long arm of an
          acrocentric chromosome (Figures <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1Eand 1F</ENAMEX>). By comparison
          with previous studies [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11</NUMEX> ] and because of the
          consistency of this result, it is concluded that this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> represents the integrated HPV <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> on chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>.
          There is no commercially available centromeric <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> for
          chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> to enable additional support for this
          interpretation.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        In this study the factors that enable consistent,
        sensitive but background free 
        in situ hybridization for DNA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> using biotinyl-tyramide reagent have been
        investigated. Different protocols were compared and
        assessed according to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> criteria. Firstly whether the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">protocol</ENAMEX> was sufficiently sensitive to routinely detect
        single copy (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~8 kb</NUMEX>) HPV-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">SiHa</ENAMEX> cells/chromosome
        spreads, and, secondly, whether the protocol routinely gave
        a clean background on archival FFPE tissues. According to
        these criteria a protocol has been optimized for routine
        use (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>) that allows <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">detection</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> copies of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPV</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> DNA integrated into the genome of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SiHa</ENAMEX> cells
        utilizing a chromogenic end-point. This protocol has been
        successfully applied to cell-line models (Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1A,1</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">B,1C</ENAMEX>)
        and to examine HPV infections amongst archival FFPE
        cervical carcinoma (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1D</NUMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">CIN lesions</ENAMEX> (Figures
        2A<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,2</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">B,2C</ENAMEX>). Integration of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HPV16</ENAMEX> in metaphase chromosome
        spreads prepared from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">SiHa</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>-line has also been
        demonstrated using a fluorescent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> molecule (Figures
        1Eand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">1F</ENAMEX>).
        The most important factors for high sensitivity were the
        use a sodium citrate step followed by the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pepsin</ENAMEX>/HCl
        for tissue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unmasking</ENAMEX>, the use of probes at a concentration
        of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 0.5 ng</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/Î¼l</ENAMEX> hybridization mix, and, the concentration
        of primary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">streptavidin-peroxidase</ENAMEX>. That HPV DNA integrated
        into metaphase chromosomes was detectable by fluorescence
        but not chromogenic stains indicates an additional order of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sensitivity</ENAMEX> is possible by combination of biotinyl-tyramide
        with reagents such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FITC</ENAMEX>.
        A sodium citrate tissue-unmasking step was also of key
        importance for the elimination of background staining. AEC
        was the chromogen of choice for clean background. Certain
        probes were more "dirty" than others. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Composition</ENAMEX> and pH of
        hybridization <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mix</ENAMEX> and post-hybridization wash buffer pH
        were important in these instances.
        The optimized protocol was applied to archival FFPE
        cervical carcinomas and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">CIN lesions</ENAMEX> for the detection of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HPV DNA</ENAMEX>. "<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Punctate</ENAMEX>" signals were detected amongst
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">carcinomas</ENAMEX> and high-grade <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">CIN lesions</ENAMEX> but were rare amongst
        (non-conylomatous) <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">CIN I lesions</ENAMEX>, which were characterized
        by "diffuse" signals occupying entire nuclei and detectable
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid</TIMEX>/superficial layers. These observations are
        consistent with earlier studies that a punctate signal is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> of integration and a diffuse signal of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">episomal HPV</ENAMEX>, and with the theory that integration is an
        important factor in lesion progression [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2 12</ENAMEX> ] . The data
        suggest the optimized method may be useful in screening CIN
        lesions for integration. However, further studies are
        required to confirm a punctate signal is only
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> of integration. The demonstration of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1-2</ENAMEX>
        copies of integrated HPV DNA detected as punctate signal
        begs the question as to why single/low-copy episomal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPV</ENAMEX> is
        not also detectable as punctate signal. Initial infection
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPV</ENAMEX> is understood to occur in the basal layer of the
        epithelium, and productive replication is tied to cell
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">differentiation/maturation</ENAMEX> (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2A</TIMEX>.) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPV</ENAMEX> was
        not detected by the assay in basal/parabasal cells of
        (non-condylomatous) <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">CIN I lesions</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 30</NUMEX> examined; unless
        HPV-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> positive [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] ) suggesting low-copy number episomal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPV</ENAMEX> was not detectable and indicating a limit to the
        sensitivity of the assay.
        A possible explanation maybe that that ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> kilo-base
        single/low-copy episomal HPV sequences may be subject to
        relatively more degradation and loss from tissues during
        routine processing than <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HPV DNA</ENAMEX> that is physically
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">integrated</ENAMEX> into the human chromosome (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~50 - 250</NUMEX> mega-base
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pairs</ENAMEX>). Excessive degradation may affect retention of DNA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> during 
        in situ hybridization assay as well
        as hybridization efficiency. Additionally/alternatively,
        the sensitivity of the assay on archival tissues may be
        less than that on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">SiHa</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>-line model despite
        attempting equivalent procedures through formalin-fixation
        and routine paraffin embedding. If this is the case, then
        punctate signal detected in carcinomas and high-grade CIN
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lesions</ENAMEX> may only represent integration of multiple copies
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPV</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> within the genome, and low-copy episomal
        (or integrated) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> may remain sub-threshold on archival
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">FFPE samples</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Episomal HPV</ENAMEX> can also occur in the form of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concatamers</ENAMEX> comprising multiple copies of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPV</ENAMEX> genome
        compounded into 'super-molecules'. It can be speculated
        that these forms could also give rise to punctate
        signals.
        Centromeric probe signal was readily demonstrable using
        biotinyl-tyramide based 
        in situ hybridization (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2D</NUMEX>).
        Currently numerical chromosome count is generally
        determined by hybridization with directly labeled
        fluorescent probes. This has the advantages of allowing
        simultaneous assay of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> or more differently labeled
        probes and detection directly after post-hybridization
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">washes</ENAMEX>. The disadvantage is the requirement for specialized
        microscopy, visualization of tissue specimens through
        multiple filters, multiple image capture, and the
        relatively short half-life during which signal is visible.
        Biotinyl-tyramide assay has the disadvantage of requiring
        several incubations to detect biotin label. It has the
        advantages of allowing hematoxylin counterstaining that
        allows easier determination of cell/tissue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">morphology</ENAMEX>,
        visualization by bright <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">field microscopy</ENAMEX>, and signal that
        is available for counting <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than one year</TIMEX> after test
        application (slides have been kept in the dark).
        Unequivocal signal was also demonstrated (to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX>'
        knowledge for <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time by a tyramide based assay) of the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> copies of HPV16 integrated at chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13q21</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX>
        (Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1Eand 1F</ENAMEX>) on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">metaphase</TIMEX> spreads prepared from SiHa
        cells.
        There are many variables associated with tyramide-ISH.
        In this study a number of these have been systematically
        examined and a sensitive background-free assay has been
        demonstrated. In this study biotin-labeled probes and
        biotinylated-tyramide were utilized. Background may also be
        reduced by using digoxigenin-labeled <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> and
        anti-digoxigenin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> conjugated with horseradish
        peroxidase before the amplification step of
        biotinyl-tyramide (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chao-Cheng Huang</ENAMEX>, personal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">communication</ENAMEX>). Possibly oligonucleotide probes may also
        give less background than full-length sequences.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Non-biotin</ENAMEX>-based-tyramide reagents, including fluorescent
        reagents are available from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PerkinElmer Life Sciences</ENAMEX> and
        from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAKO</ENAMEX>. These reagents (used in conjunction with
        non-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">biotin</NUMEX>-labeled probes) may be particularly beneficial
        for applications on tissues where endogenous biotin is
        problematic. An additional level of sensitivity may be
        possible on tissues using fluorescene given the finding
        that HPV integrated on chromosome spreads could be
        demonstrated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FITC</ENAMEX> but not AEC or DAB.
      
      
        Conclusions
        A <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">biotinyl-tyramide</ENAMEX>-based 
        in situ hybridization protocol has
        been optimized that allows sensitive detection of DNA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> in FFPE tissues and metaphase spreads. The
        protocol is especially robust with respect to absence of
        background staining that can limit assay interpretation. As
        such the protocol may have clinical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX> in the survey
        of routine cervical samples for HPV 'punctate' signals that
        are associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">high-grade lesions</ENAMEX>. Additionally the
        method can be used to detect numerical chromosome
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aberrations</ENAMEX> in archival pathology samples and so represents
        an alternative to the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">FISH assays</ENAMEX> that require
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">specialized</ENAMEX> microscopy.
