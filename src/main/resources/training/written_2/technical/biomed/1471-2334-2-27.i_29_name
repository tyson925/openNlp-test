        Several <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">anionic polymers</ENAMEX> were shown to have HIV-1
        inhibitory activity and are being considered and evaluated
        as vaginal topical microbicides for prevention of
        transmission of sexually transmitted <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> (STD)
        pathogens, including <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HIV-1</ENAMEX>. These <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">polymers</ENAMEX> belong to
        several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX>: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) sulfate esters of polysaccharides
        (dextrin and dextran sulfates [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11</NUMEX> ] ;
        cellulose sulfate [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13 14 15</NUMEX> ] ; sulfate esters of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">galactose</ENAMEX> + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,6</NUMEX>-anhydrogalactose copolymers {carrageenan; [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 16 17 18 19</NUMEX> ] }); (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">polymers</ENAMEX> containing sulfonated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">benzene</ENAMEX> or naphthalene rings {poly(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">styrene-4-sulfonate</ENAMEX>) [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21</NUMEX> ] } and naphthalene sulfonate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">polymers</ENAMEX> {PRO2000 [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 24</NUMEX> ] }; and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) polycarboxylates (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acrylic acid polymers</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">{Carbomer</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">974P</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">BufferGel</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 26 27 28 29</NUMEX> ] }); and acetyl
        phthaloyl cellulose {cellulose acetate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">phthalate</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAP</ENAMEX>) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31 32 33 34 35 36 37</NUMEX> ] }.
        The mechanisms involved in sexual transmission of HIV-1
        appear to be complex and are not yet fully defined [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38 39</NUMEX>
        ] . Thus, a microbicide with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HIV-1</ENAMEX> inhibitory activity
        could provide protection 
        in vivo only if both the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">compound</ENAMEX> and
        the virus reach susceptible cells before productive
        infection could occur. This might be difficult to
        accomplish. For this reason, it is preferable that
        microbicides irreversibly inactivate the virus upon the
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> compound/HIV-1 encounter in the vaginal environment,
        i.e. microbicides should have direct virucidal activity.
        Such activity was reported for dextran sulfate after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> h
        incubation with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HIV-1</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] but results of other studies
        indicated that dextran sulfate failed to neutralize virus
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">infectivity</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4 10</ENAMEX> ] . Inactivation of HIV-1 by carrageenan
        was reported in a review article [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BufferGel</ENAMEX> is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">virucidal</ENAMEX> against HIV-1 by providing a buffered low pH
        environment (pH 3.9 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] ), but virus inactivation might
        be incomplete and possibly compromised by minor pH
        increases due to the presence of seminal fluid [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> ] . To
        be effective in preventing infection by direct virus
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inactivation</ENAMEX>, anti-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">HIV-1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">microbicides</ENAMEX> must be virucidal
        against both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">X4</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">R5</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">viruses</ENAMEX>, utilizing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CXCR4 and CCR5</TIMEX> as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coreceptors</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39 41</NUMEX> ] , respectively, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">R5 HIV-1</ENAMEX> being most
        frequently sexually transmitted. Recent results [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36 37</NUMEX> ] ,
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">R. Shattock</ENAMEX>, personal communication) indicate that CAP in
        soluble form meets these requirements. Since <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CAP</ENAMEX>, unlike
        the other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">polymers</ENAMEX> listed above, is not soluble at low pH,
        characteristic for a normal vaginal environment [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ] ,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">micronized</ENAMEX> forms of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CAP</ENAMEX> had to be used in microbicidal
        formulations of this compound [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30 31 32 33 34</NUMEX> ] .
        Therefore, it was of interest to determine how CAP in
        micronized form and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> polymeric microbicides
        affect <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">X4 and R5</TIMEX> viruses represented by HIV-1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIIB</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">BaL</ENAMEX>,
        respectively.

          polyclonal rabbit anti-gp120 (diluted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX>-fold) for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> h
          at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20Â°C</TIMEX>. Serial <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-fold dilutions in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> containing <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX> BSA
          and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX> gelatin (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>-BG) of preparations containing gp120
          were added to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wells</ENAMEX>. After <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4 h</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20Â°C</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wells</ENAMEX> were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">washed</ENAMEX> and bound gp120 was detected by addition of

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HRP</ENAMEX> was quantitated as described above. The experiments
          were done in triplicate.

          treated and control virus to suppress the effect of

          virus preparations, on <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">virus</ENAMEX> infection [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48 49</NUMEX> ] . After
          incubation at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37Â°C</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">48 h</TIMEX>, the culture supernatant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fluids</ENAMEX> were removed and the cells washed once with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>.
          Subsequently, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 Î¼l</NUMEX> of lysis buffer from the

          transferred into <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wells</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX>-well microplates and
          Î²-galactosidase was quantitated using the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Galacto-Light</ENAMEX>

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control HIV-1 BaL</ENAMEX> was measured by the same method except
          that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MAGI-CCR5</ENAMEX> cells were used.
          Measurement of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HIV-1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">infectivity</ENAMEX> in seminal fluid is

          Micronized CAP induces gp41 <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>-helix bundle
          formation and is virucidal against HIV-1
          Earlier studies [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36 37</NUMEX> ] . indicated that soluble CAP
          at neutral pH binds to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the CXCR4 and CCR5</TIMEX> coreceptor
          binding <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> on HIV-1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIIB</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">BaL</ENAMEX>, respectively, and
          induced the formation of "dead-end" gp41 <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>-helix
          bundles. These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">properties</ENAMEX> of soluble CAP appear to be
          involved in the virus inhibitory and virucidal activities
          of this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">compound</ENAMEX>. However, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CAP</ENAMEX> is not soluble at < pH
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.5</NUMEX> and would precipitate in a healthy human vaginal
          environment which is mildly acidic with a pH range of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.5</NUMEX>
          - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.5</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53</TIMEX> ] . The precipitate would have drastically
          reduced antiviral activity. To overcome this problem, CAP
          in a micronized form was used and proven to have
          virucidal activity against HIV-1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIIB</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] and shown to
          be effective in reducing vaginal infection by simian
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">immunodeficiency</ENAMEX> virus (SIV) in a macaque model [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] .
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Micronized CAP</ENAMEX> provides a low pH buffering system and
          this may have contributed to its virucidal properties. In
          order to correlate the properties of CAP in soluble and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">micronized</ENAMEX> forms, it was necessary to establish whether
          or not micronized <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CAP</ENAMEX> would bind HIV-1 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">virus</ENAMEX> particles
          and HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins, and induce the
          formation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">gp41 six</NUMEX>-helix bundles, a marker of
          irreversible virus inactivation, as did soluble <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CAP</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37</NUMEX>
          ] . First it was established that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HIV-1 gp120</ENAMEX> bound to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">micronized CAP</ENAMEX> (provided in the form of micronized CAP
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">particles</ENAMEX> or of a commercial product, "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Aquateric</ENAMEX>",
          containing <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 66%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CAP</ENAMEX> and used for enteric coating
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tablets</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">capsules</ENAMEX> in the pharmaceutical industry [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">54</NUMEX> ] ); (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Similar results were obtained when
          gp120 was diluted in seminal fluid (diluted <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1:1</TIMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.14</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M NaCl</ENAMEX>). Under these conditions, â‰¥ <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99.9997%</NUMEX> of gp120
          bound to micronized <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CAP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aquateric</ENAMEX> (final
          concentration of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CAP</ENAMEX>: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">121.5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/ml), respectively. HIV-1
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIIB</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">BaL</ENAMEX> virus particles also bound effectively in
          the presence of seminal fluid to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aquateric</ENAMEX> formulated
          into a topical gel (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
          As a result of interaction with micronized <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CAP</ENAMEX> (in the
          form of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aquateric</ENAMEX>), the integrity of both HIV-1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIIB</ENAMEX> and
          HIV-1 BaL <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">virus particles</ENAMEX> was strikingly affected as
          indicated by the observation that most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p24 antigen</ENAMEX>
          after virus contact with micronized <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CAP</ENAMEX> was no longer
          precipitable by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">polyethylene</ENAMEX> glycol <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6000</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PEG</ENAMEX>) unlike
          p24 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> within untreated <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">virus particles</ENAMEX> which
          precipitates under these conditions (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>).
          Furthermore, interaction with micronized CAP elicited the
          formation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">gp41 six</NUMEX>-helix bundles which were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">undetectable</ENAMEX> or present at low levels in untreated virus
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">particles</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] . The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>-helix bundles detectable by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ELISA</ENAMEX> were mostly not precipitable by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3%</NUMEX> PEG indicating
          that they were no longer associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">virus</ENAMEX> particles
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). Furthermore, they were detected partially
          (HIV-1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIIB</ENAMEX>) or entirely (HIV-1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BaL</ENAMEX>) in a form not bound
          anymore to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">micronized CAP particles</ENAMEX>, unlike most of
          the virus-derived p24 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX>. This suggests that
          interaction of virus particles with micronized CAP
          resulted in stripping off of the viral envelopes which
          was more noticeable with HIV-1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BaL</ENAMEX> than with HIV-1
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIIB</ENAMEX>.
          To confirm that gp41 <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> helix bundle formation was
          caused by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contact</ENAMEX> of virus particles with the micronized
          form of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CAP</ENAMEX> (= <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aquateric</ENAMEX>) and not by low pH contributed
          by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CAP</ENAMEX>, purified <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HIV-1</ENAMEX> III B and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">BaL</ENAMEX>, respectively, was
          exposed for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 min</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37Â°C</NUMEX> to acidic buffers (final pH
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.9</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.5</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.0</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4.5 and 5.0</NUMEX>). The suspensions were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neutralized</ENAMEX> and assayed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ELISA</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>-helix bundles.
          The results were negative (absorbance in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.068</NUMEX>
          range, the same as for viruses exposed to pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.0</NUMEX> in the
          absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAP</ENAMEX>). Poloxamer, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">constituent</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Aquateric (â‰</ENAMEX>¤
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">33%</NUMEX>) at a final concentration of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/ml also did not
          induce the formation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>-helix bundles.
          Results shown above indicated that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HIV-1</ENAMEX> adsorbed onto
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">micronized CAP</ENAMEX> and that the CAP - virus interaction lead
          to the formation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">gp41 six</NUMEX>-helix bundles, a hallmark
          for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HIV-1</TIMEX> inactivation. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] To confirm that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contact</ENAMEX> of
          virus with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">micronized CAP</ENAMEX> leads to loss of HIV-1
          infectivity, HIV-1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIIB</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">BaL</ENAMEX>, respectively, were
          diluted in seminal fluid and the diluted virus
          preparations were mixed with an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aquateric</ENAMEX> formulation
          (for composition, see legend to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) at volume ratios
          of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3:1, 1:1 and 1:3</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 min</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37Â°C</TIMEX>. Subsequently, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">micronized Aquateric</ENAMEX> particles were sedimented by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">centrifugation</ENAMEX>. The supernatant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fluids</ENAMEX> were brought to pH
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.0</NUMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pellets</ENAMEX> were dissolved by addition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Na</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3 PO</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> (final pH = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.0</NUMEX>). All fractions were
          then precipitated by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PEG</ENAMEX> and the redissolved <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pellets</ENAMEX>
          tested at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2- to 256</NUMEX>-fold dilutions for infectivity (see
          Methods section). Infectious virus was undetectable (â‰¥
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99.6%</NUMEX> and â‰¥ <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99.2%</NUMEX> inactivation of HIV-1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIIB</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">BaL</ENAMEX>,
          respectively). Similar results were obtained with other
          CAP formulations (data not shown).
        
        
          Induction of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>-helix bundle formation by
          polymeric anionic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> microbicides
          Since elicitation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">gp41 six</NUMEX>-helix bundles might be
          involved in, or contribute to the virucidal activity of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate microbicides</ENAMEX>, it was of interest to determine
          whether anionic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">polymers</ENAMEX> other than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CAP</ENAMEX> also induced
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>-helix bundle formation in HIV-1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIIB</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">BaL</ENAMEX> virus
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">particles</ENAMEX>.
          Results in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4show that carrageenan, cellulose
          sulfate, dextran sulfate, poly(napthalene sulfonate) and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">poly</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">styrene-4-sulfonate</ENAMEX>) all elicit <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">gp41 six</NUMEX>-helix
          bundle formation in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HIV-1</TIMEX> IIIB but somewhat less
          effectively in comparison with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CAP</ENAMEX>. On the other hand,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carbomer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">974P</ENAMEX>, the active ingredient in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">BufferGel</ENAMEX>, was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inactive</ENAMEX> in this respect. Strikingly different results
          were obtained for HIV-1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">BaL</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>), and show that only
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CAP</ENAMEX> and to a lesser extent poly(napthalene sulfonate)
          elicited gp41 <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>-helix bundles detectable by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ELISA</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Effect of anionic polymeric microbicide candidates
          on the integrity of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HIV-1</ENAMEX> particles
          Since micronized CAP caused the dissociation of HIV-1
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">particles</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] ; (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>), it was of interest to
          determine whether anionic polymeric candidate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microbicides</ENAMEX> in soluble form at neutral pH would have
          similar effects. While no such effects were seen with
          HIV-1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIIB</ENAMEX>, the integrity of HIV-1 BaL appeared to be
          partially diminished by treatment with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CAP</ENAMEX> and
          drastically affected by cellulose sulfate (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). The
          latter finding was confirmed by the observation that
          HIV-1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BaL</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">gp120</ENAMEX> was no longer precipitable by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3%</NUMEX> PEG or
          pellettable by centrifugation after treatment of the
          virus with cellulose sulfate, unlike gp120 associated
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">untreated virus particles</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>). This was not
          seen with cellulose <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfate</ENAMEX> treated HIV-1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIIB</ENAMEX> (data not
          shown).
        
        
          Comparative virucidal activity of polymeric anionic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microbicide</ENAMEX> candidates
          HIV-1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIIB</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">BaL</ENAMEX>, respectively, were treated with
          the distinct <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">polymers</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">10 mg/ml</ENAMEX>) for <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 min at 37Â°C</NUMEX> and
          the infectivity of the treated viruses was compared with
          that of control untreated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HIV-1</TIMEX>. In repeated experiments
          with HIV-1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIIB</ENAMEX>, soluble and micronized <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CAP</ENAMEX>, cellulose
          sulfate, poly(naphthalene sulfonate),
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">poly</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">styrene-4-sulfonate</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">BufferGel</ENAMEX>, respectively,
          caused a â‰¥ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">140</NUMEX>-fold reduction in infectivity, while
          dextran sulfate, carrageenan and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carbomer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">974P</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">pH 7</ENAMEX>),
          respectively, were less effective (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4- to 25</NUMEX>-fold
          reduction in infectivity). A typical example for HIV-1
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIIB</ENAMEX> is shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>.
          Representative results shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 9indicate that
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">polymers differed</ENAMEX> from each other more substantially
          with respect to their capacity to inactivate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV-1 BaL</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">micronized CAP</ENAMEX>, cellulose sulfate, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BufferGel</ENAMEX> and the aryl
          sulfonates being most effective.
        
        
          Inhibitory effect of polymeric anionic microbicide
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> on blood clotting
          For the selection of the most promising candidate
          microbicides, it is important to compare not only their
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">virus inhibitory</ENAMEX> and virucidal activities, but to also
          study their potential untoward effects. Since heparin and
          other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">anionic polymers</ENAMEX> are known to inhibit blood
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clotting</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">55</TIMEX> ] , the effect of anionic polymeric
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microbicide</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood clotting</ENAMEX> was measured.
          While <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CAP</ENAMEX>, carrageenan and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">BufferGel</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carbomer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">974P</ENAMEX>) had
          moderate or no effects, cellulose sulfate, dextran
          sulfate, poly(napthalene sulfonate) and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">poly</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">styrene-4-sulfonate</ENAMEX>) greatly inhibited clotting of
          ACD plasma (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>). The increase in clotting time might
          be potentially undesirable for topical applications under
          conditions of local preexisting injury or bleeding.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        Several <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">anionic polymers</ENAMEX> are being considered as topical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microbicides</ENAMEX> to prevent sexual transmission of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HIV-1</TIMEX>. They
        include: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) sulfate esters of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">polysaccharides</NUMEX> {carrageenan
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 16 17 18 19</NUMEX> ] , cellulose sulfate [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13 14 15</NUMEX> ] , and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dextran</ENAMEX> or dextrin sulfate [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11</NUMEX> ] };
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) aryl sulfonates {poly(naphthalene sulfonate) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 23 24</NUMEX>
        ] and poly(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">styrene-4-sulfonate</ENAMEX>) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21</NUMEX> ] }; and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>)
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aliphatic</ENAMEX> {<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carbomer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">974P/BufferGel</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 26 27 28 29</NUMEX> ] } and
        aromatic carboxylates {CAP [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37</NUMEX> ] }.
        The anti-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">HIV-1</NUMEX> properties of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">polymers</ENAMEX> are expected to
        depend on their complexation with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">virus</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> which is
        likely to occur mainly through the formation of salt
        linkages or ion pairs between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">oppositely</ENAMEX> charged <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> on
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">polymers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">virus</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, respectively [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">56</TIMEX> ] .
        However, the anti-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">HIV-1</NUMEX> properties of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">polymers</ENAMEX> may
        depend not only on their charge density, but also on the
        characteristics of their uncharged portions, which may be
        involved in hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding interactions
        which can elicit profound conformational changes in
        hydrophobic regions of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and cause disassembly of
        complex proteins consisting of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">subunits</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">57</TIMEX> ] . For these
        reasons it is not be expected that all <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">anionic polymers</ENAMEX>,
        considered as anti-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">HIV-1</NUMEX> microbicides, would have similar
        biological activities.
        
        In vivo protection by anti-HIV-1
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">compounds</ENAMEX> against sexual transmission of the virus could
        only be accomplished if the compounds at sufficient
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">concentrations</ENAMEX>, and the virus both reach susceptible cells
        within genital mucosa before productive infection could
        occur [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38 39</NUMEX> ] . Considering the complex events involved
        in sexual transmission of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HIV-1</TIMEX>, this might not be easily
        accomplished. Therefore, inactivation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HIV-1</ENAMEX> infectivity
        preceding virus contact with susceptible target cells
        should be considered a preferred mechanism of protection
        against infection. For this reason it was of interest to
        study the virucidal activity of anionic polymeric
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microbicide</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> against both X4 (using CXCR4 as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coreceptor</ENAMEX>) and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">R5</TIMEX> (using CCR5 as coreceptor) viruses, the
        latter being most frequently transmitted sexually [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ]
        .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Soluble CAP</ENAMEX> at neutral pH was shown to bind strongly to
        the coreceptor binding <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">gp120</TIMEX> of both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">X4</ENAMEX> and R5
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">viruses</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] and to elicit the formation of gp41
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>-helix bundles, the hallmark of irreversible virus
        inactivation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] . Thus, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HIV-1</TIMEX> exposed to CAP at
        sufficient concentrations is rendered noninfectious, and
        continued presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CAP</ENAMEX> is not required to maintain lack
        of infectivity. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CAP</ENAMEX> differs from all other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">anionic polymers</ENAMEX>
        listed above, in that it is not soluble at pH < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.5</NUMEX>.
        Therefore, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CAP</ENAMEX> would be expected to precipitate in a normal
        acidic vaginal environment. To avoid this, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CAP</ENAMEX> in
        micronized form (which does not aggregate at low pH),
        instead of CAP in soluble form is being considered as a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">topical microbicide</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30 31 32 33 34 35</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Micronized CAP</ENAMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aquateric</ENAMEX>) was shown to be virucidal against <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HIV-1</TIMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">herpesviruses</ENAMEX> and several nonviral sexually transmitted
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">disease</ENAMEX> (STD) pathogens [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30 31 32 33 34</NUMEX> ] . The virucidal
        activity of micronized <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CAP</ENAMEX> could at least partly be
        explained by its buffering capacity at low pH [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> ] since
        it is a free <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> while other anionic polymeric microbicide
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> (except <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">BufferGel</ENAMEX>, the active ingredient of
        which is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carbomer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">974P</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] ) are sodium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salts</ENAMEX>. Results
        presented here explain how micronized CAP inactivates
        HIV-1. Both the envelope glycoprotein <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">gp120</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) and
        HIV-1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIIB</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">BaL virus particles</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) in the presence
        of an excess of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nonviral proteins</ENAMEX>, including seminal fluid,
        bind effectively to micronized CAP. Under 
        in vivo conditions (when the virus
        concentrations are by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> orders of magnitude lower
        than those used here under experimental conditions [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">58 59</NUMEX>
        ] , (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>)), this would be expected to physically remove
        virus particles by adsorption onto micronized CAP
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aquateric</ENAMEX>) so that they would cease to be available to
        initiate the complex sequence of events leading to mucosal
        infection. Furthermore, interaction with micronized CAP
        elicits the formation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">gp41 six</NUMEX>-helix bundles and causes
        the stripping off of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>).
        The formation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">gp41 six</NUMEX>-helix bundles was not due to
        exposure to a low pH environment provided by the micronized
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CAP</ENAMEX>, since exposure to low pH buffers did not elicit gp41
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>-helix bundle formation. In summary, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contact</ENAMEX> of
        HIV-1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIIB</ENAMEX> and HIV-1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BaL</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">X4</ENAMEX> and R5
        viruses respectively, with micronized <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CAP</ENAMEX>, resulted in a
        complex sequence of events involving virus adsorption,
        exposure to low pH, induction of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">gp41 six</NUMEX>-helix bundles,
        and stripping off of viral envelopes and virus
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">disintegration</ENAMEX>, ultimately resulting in loss of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">infectivity</ENAMEX>.
        In order to contribute to the understanding of the
        potential virucidal activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">anionic polymers</ENAMEX>, their
        capacity to induce gp41 <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>-helix bundle formation was
        measured and compared with that of CAP in soluble form (pH
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">7.0</NUMEX>). All <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">polymers</ENAMEX> except <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Carbomer 974P</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">elicited</ENAMEX> gp41
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>-helix bundle formation in HIV-1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIIB</ENAMEX>, albeit in some
        cases less efficiently in comparison with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CAP</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). On
        the other hand, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">gp41 six</NUMEX>-helix bundle formation in HIV-1
        BaL was detectable only for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CAP</ENAMEX> and poly(naphthalene
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sulfonate</ENAMEX>) treated virus (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>) suggesting differences
        among the anionic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">polymers</ENAMEX> with respect to their activity
        against the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">R5</NUMEX> virus HIV-1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BaL</ENAMEX>. The induction of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>-helix
        bundles in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HIV-1</TIMEX> does not seem to be the only mechanism
        involved in virucidal activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">anionic polymers</ENAMEX> (compare
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Figs.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">8and 9</ENAMEX>) and there might be other
        contributing processes.
        Since CAP in micronized form was shown to cause
        disintegration of HIV-1 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">virus particles</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] , (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>),
        it was of interest to determine whether any of the other
        anionic polymeric microbicide <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> affect the
        integrity of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">virus particles</ENAMEX>. While HIV-1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIIB</ENAMEX> was not
        affected significantly by any of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">polymers</ENAMEX> tested, CAP
        to some extent, but surprisingly cellulose sulfate affected
        the integrity of HIV-1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BaL</ENAMEX> particles (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). These
        results were supported by the observation that HIV-1 BaL
        gp120 after treatment with cellulose sulfate, unlike virus
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">gp120</ENAMEX>, did not become precipitated with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3%</NUMEX> PEG
        and failed to pellet by centrifugation under conditions
        leading to sedimentation of intact virus particles (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>)]. The differential sensitivity of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">an R5</TIMEX> virus, HIV-1
        BaL, as compared to an R4 <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">virus</ENAMEX>, HIV-1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIIB</ENAMEX>, to the same
        negatively charged polyelectrolyte appears unprecedented to
        the best of our knowledge.
        Among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> polysaccharide sulfate esters
        (carrageenan, cellulose sulfate and dextran sulfate),
        cellulose sulfate appeared to be more effective against
        HIV-1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BaL</ENAMEX> than the other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">polymers</ENAMEX>. This might be due to the
        polysaccharide backbone of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cellulose</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60</TIMEX> ] with a
        propensity to form strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds and
        to be involved in hydrophobic interactions more than
        soluble <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dextrans</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">61</TIMEX> ] and galactose +
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,6</NUMEX>-anhydrogalactose copolymers (= the saccharide moiety of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">carrageenan</ENAMEX>) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">62 63</NUMEX> ] . Among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">polymers</ENAMEX> containing
        aryl sulfonates, poly(napthalene sulfonate) was more
        effective than poly(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">styrene-4-sulfonate</ENAMEX>) with respect to
        induction of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">gp41 six</NUMEX>-helix bundles in HIV-1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BaL</ENAMEX>. This
        difference may possibly be due to the high propensity of
        the uncharged part of the molecule {poly(naphtalene)} to be
        involved in hydrophobic interactions. Among the two
        carboxylate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">polymers</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carbomer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">974P</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CAP</ENAMEX>), only soluble
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CAP</ENAMEX> (at neutral pH) was able to elicit the formation of
        gp41 <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>-helix bundles in both HIV-1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIIB</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BaL</ENAMEX> and was
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">virucidal</ENAMEX> against both of these viruses. The insoluble,
        micronized form of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CAP</ENAMEX> had similar properties. The
        differences in biological activities of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">polymers</ENAMEX> is
        probably due to their noncharged portions, i.e. mainly the
        occurrence of benzene rings in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">CAP</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Polycarboxylates</ENAMEX> (soluble <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CAP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carbomer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">974P</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>) had a minimal effect on plasma coagulation. Among the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sulfonates</ENAMEX> and polysaccharide sulfates, carrageenan and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">poly</ENAMEX>(napthalene sulfonate) had lower anti-coagulant
        activity in comparison with cellulose sulfate, dextran
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sulfate</ENAMEX> and poly(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">styrene-4-sulfonate</ENAMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>).
        Consideration of these side effects might contribute to the
        process of selection of preferred microbicides for future
        large-scale use.
      
      
        Conclusions
        Among anionic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">polymers</ENAMEX> considered as topical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microbicides</ENAMEX> to prevent sexual transmission of HIV-1
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">{Carbomer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">974P/BufferGel</ENAMEX>, carrageenan, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CAP</ENAMEX>, cellulose
        sulfate, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dextran</ENAMEX>/dextrin sulfate, poly(napthalene
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sulfonate</ENAMEX>) and poly(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">styrene-4-sulfonate</ENAMEX>)}, CAP formulated
        in a micronized form, is the only compound which has a
        capacity to remove from physiological <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fluids</ENAMEX> infectious
        virus by adsorption onto the micronized particles. The
        interaction between HIV-1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIIB</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> of X4
        viruses, and HIV-1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BaL</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">R5</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">viruses</ENAMEX>,
        with the micronized form of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CAP</ENAMEX> has the following
        consequences: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) elicitation of "dead-end" gp41 <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>-helix
        bundles expected to render the virus incompetent to fuse
        with target cells; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) loss of virus integrity and stripping
        off of the envelope glycoproteins; and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) inactivation of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">virus infectivity</ENAMEX>. Elicitation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">gp41 six</NUMEX>-helix bundles
        and virucidal activity represent shared properties between
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">micronized</ENAMEX> and soluble (at sufficient concentrations) forms
        of CAP [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] .
        As determined by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ELISA</ENAMEX>, the aforementioned <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">polymers</ENAMEX>
        other than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CAP</ENAMEX> (except <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Carbomer 974P</ENAMEX>) also elicited gp41
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>-helix bundle formation in HIV-1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIIB</ENAMEX>, albeit less
        effectively than CAP. On the other hand, only
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">poly</ENAMEX>(napthalene sulfonate), in addition to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CAP</ENAMEX>, elicited
        detectable <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>-helix bundle formation in HIV-1 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BaL</ENAMEX>. This
        suggests that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">X4</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">R5</ENAMEX> viruses may be differently affected
        by some of the polymeric compounds being considered as
        topical microbicides. This was confirmed by the results of
        assays for virucidal activity.
