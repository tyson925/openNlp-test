        It has been suggested that solid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tumours</ENAMEX> can not grow
        beyond <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60-80</NUMEX> cells without inducing the formation of new
        blood vessels: <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tumour angiogenesis</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . This blood
        vessel formation requires proliferation of endothelial
        cells, cell migration and the lysis of the different
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">components of the matrix</ENAMEX> (collagen, elastin, fibronectin)
        by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several proteases</TIMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of great importance, urokinase
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">uPA</NUMEX>) and its high affinity receptor, the GPI-anchored
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">membrane</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD87</ENAMEX> (uPAR), is critical in tumour progression and
        its level of expression is correlated with poor prognosis
        of various <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX> such as prostate [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] , breast [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] ,
        colon [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] , ovarian [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] , gastric [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] , brain [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] ,
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lung cancer</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Urokinase</ENAMEX> (uPA) and its main
        product plasmin belong to the very early proteases [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9 10</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> ] that activate the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">metallo-protease</ENAMEX> (MMP) cascade and
        therefore control cell motility, tissue remodelling and the
        activation of various angiogenic factors (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGFÎ²</ENAMEX>). Most
        of these proteases (e.g. uPA) are localised at the tumour
        site through <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> that are highly expressed on the
        surface of activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">endothelial cells</ENAMEX> and tumour cells. A
        high level of uPAR at the invasive edge of the tumour
        concentrates uPA where neoangiogenesis occurs [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] ,
        generating the full activation of the MMP cascade [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] .
        Furthermore, various cellular migrations proceed upon the
        transient attachment of the uPAR to matrix components (e.g.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vitronectin</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] , and uPA as well as plasmin activate
        angiogenic factors such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VEGF</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HGF</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FGFs</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGFÎ²</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 17</NUMEX> ] .
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">matrix lysis</ENAMEX> can be divided in two
        categories: the synthetic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> and the endogenous
        ones. Most of the synthetic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> are competitive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inhibitors</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">metallo-proteases</ENAMEX>, mimicking the
        substrate of the enzymes (marismatat and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">derivatives</ENAMEX>). The
        endogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> (e.g. endostatin, angiostatin,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thrombospondin</ENAMEX>) differ in their angiostatic activity from
        synthetic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX>, since they appear to also block
        endothelial cell proliferation and/or migration. In this
        paper we described the antitumour effects of a hybrid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, consisting of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amino Terminal Fragment</ENAMEX> linked
        to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bovine Pancreatic Trypsin Inhibitor</ENAMEX> (ATF-BPTI),
        delivered by gene therapy with adenoviral vector.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATF</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal part of the uPA (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">residues 1-135</ENAMEX>)
        that binds to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">uPA receptor</ENAMEX> (uPAR) and thus inhibits the
        formation of the uPA-uPAR <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Systemic</ENAMEX> and local
        delivery of an adenovirus encoding ATF have been shown to
        inhibit the growth of primary tumour implants as well as of
        tumour metastasis in different animal models [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 19</NUMEX> ] . In
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ATF-BPTI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chimeric protein</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATF</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> functions (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>)
        the anti uPA effect with its known angiostatic activity and
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) delivery of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPTI</ENAMEX> at the tumour site due to
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-expression of uPAR on tumour and endothelial cells.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATF</ENAMEX> is species specific between the human and the mouse
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] and is not specific between the mouse and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX>.
        The murinised version of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ATF-BPTI</ENAMEX> differs by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> amino
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> from the human version It was shown to bind to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rat receptor</ENAMEX> and to inhibit plasmin activity in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> model
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPTI</ENAMEX> (commercialised as aprotinin) is a serine
        protease <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitor</ENAMEX> prepared from bovine lung tissue which
        dose dependently inhibits human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">trypsin</ENAMEX>, plasmin and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kallikrein</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aprotinin</ENAMEX> acts in a number of interrelated ways
        to provide an anti-fibrinolytic effect. Thus, aprotinin is
        mainly used in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinic</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-haemorrhagic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> in
        extracorporal circulation (valve <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">replacement</ENAMEX>, coronary
        by-pass), for preventing postoperative haemorrhage, and as
        anti protease in acute pancreatitis. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPTI</ENAMEX> has been used
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systemically</ENAMEX> in a few <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> tumour <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX>, and showed
        anti-tumour effects in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse hepatoma</ENAMEX>, lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">carcinoma</ENAMEX>,
        and mammary carcinoma [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 23 24</NUMEX> ] , and in a fibrosarcoma
        of the hamster [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] . However, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPTI</ENAMEX> was not further
        developed as a systemic anti tumour <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> probably because
        of its anti fibrinolytic property that might preclude its
        use in <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. Its linkage to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATF</ENAMEX> is expected to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ameliorate</ENAMEX> or reduce that side effect.
        In this study, the tumour growth inhibiting effect of
        ATF-BPTI gene transfer was investigated and compared to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">endostatin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATF</ENAMEX>. The adenoviral vector was administered
        intravenously, which leads to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATF-BPTI</ENAMEX> production and
        secretion by the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX>, or by intra <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tumoral</ENAMEX> injection. In
        the latter case, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> is mostly produced by
        transduced tumour cells. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">transplantable rat</ENAMEX> bronchial
        carcinomas, growing either as subcutaneous implants or as
        lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">metastasis</ENAMEX> were employed as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">targets</ENAMEX>. Levels of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATF-BPTI</ENAMEX> in the plasma and in tissues were determined and
        the association with tumour responses is described.
      
      
        Methods
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Animals</ENAMEX>
          Pathogen-free inbred male <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wag/Rij</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brown Norway</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX>, weighing <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">300 to 350 gr</NUMEX> were purchased from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harlan</ENAMEX>,
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Netherlands</ENAMEX>. All <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> were fed ad <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libitum</ENAMEX> with
          laboratory <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">chow</ENAMEX> and water and were kept under standard
          laboratory conditions. For assay of plasma hEndostatin,
          and mhATF-BPTI, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> were anaesthetised with isoflurane
          and bled by tail vein puncture and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> was
          collected in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EDTA</ENAMEX> containing tubes. All animal procedures
          were performed in accordance with the official guidelines
          after obtaining permission of the animal welfare
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">committee</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          ATF-BPTI cloning
          The plasmid encoding the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATF-BPTI</ENAMEX> (pAB) was provided
          by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">P. Quax</ENAMEX> (TNO-PG, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leiden</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATF</ENAMEX> plasmid was
          constructed by deleting the DNA sequences encoding amino
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">acids 139</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">401</NUMEX> of the urokinase cDNA plasmid. Then a
          DNA fragment encoding the amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids residues</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36-96</NUMEX> of
          the bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) was cloned
          into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATF</ENAMEX> plasmid resulting in a plasmid encoding the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATF</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPTI</ENAMEX> and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> of
          urokinase including the stop codon. After sequence
          confirmation, the ATF-BPTI cDNA was cloned into the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">recombinant</ENAMEX> adenovirus (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad</ENAMEX>) shuttle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">vector Adapt</ENAMEX>. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">murinised ATF-BPTI</ENAMEX> (mhAB) plasmid was constructed by an
          identical procedure, using the (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tyr22</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Arg27,29,30</NUMEX>) uPA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant</ENAMEX> cDNA as starting sequence [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] .
        
        
          Adenoviral vectors
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Recombinant</ENAMEX> adenovirus vectors were generated in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PER</ENAMEX>.C6â„¢ <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> by homologous recombination between an
          Adapter plasmid (pAdapt) and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the E1</TIMEX> deleted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> DNA
          plasmid as described elsewhere [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] . The expression
          cassette contains a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SV40</ENAMEX> poly A signal.
          As a result of the absence of sequence overlap between
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Adapt</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plasmid</ENAMEX> and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Ad5 E1</NUMEX> sequences integrated
          into the genome of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PER</ENAMEX>.C6, the vector stocks used in this
          study does not contain replicative competent adenovirus
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCA</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] .
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad Adapt</ENAMEX> mhAB encodes for a murinised form of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human ATF-BPTI</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . In this construct the mhAB, is
          preceded by the native secretion signal peptide of the
          human urokinase. The human endostatin coding sequence
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">InvivoGen</ENAMEX>, CA, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>) was cloned in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad Adapt</ENAMEX> shuttle
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vector</ENAMEX>. The encoded endostatin corresponds to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">183</NUMEX>
          residue of the human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">endostatin</ENAMEX> described by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">O'Reilly et</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1997</TIMEX>) with an intact <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">N-terminus</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HSHRDFQ</ENAMEX>...),
          preceded by the secretion signal peptide of the human
          IL-2. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad</ENAMEX>.Adapt.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Luc</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad</ENAMEX>.Adapt.LacZ are
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">recombinant</ENAMEX> adenoviral vectors in which the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">E3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> of
          Ad5 is retained and the gene of interest (luciferase or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LacZ</ENAMEX>) replaces <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the E1</TIMEX> region. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad Adapt</ENAMEX> empty is
          identical to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad Adapt</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mhAB</ENAMEX> except that it does not encode
          any <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX>.
          All vectors were produced on PER.C6â„¢ using standard
          procedures [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Infectious units</ENAMEX> (iu) were determined
          by end point cytopathogenic effect (CPE) assay on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">911</NUMEX>
          cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] . Viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">particles</ENAMEX> were determined by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPLC</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37</NUMEX> ] . The particle to infectious unit ratio was always
          lower than 10.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elisa</ENAMEX> and activity analysis
          An mhATF-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPTI ELISA</ENAMEX> was developed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">P. Quax</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> ] , using a monoclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> specific for the ATF
          as the capture <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> and a polyclonal antibody
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">directed</ENAMEX> against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPTI</ENAMEX> as the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">detector antibody</ENAMEX>. As a
          standard we used urokinase or mhATF-BPTI. The biologic
          activity of the mhATF-BPTI was tested in vitro in a
          plasmin inhibition assay using the chromogenic substrate
          S2251 (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chromogenix, MÃ¶lndahl</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sweden</ENAMEX>). Diluted samples of
          Ad Adapt mhAB infected <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">A549</NUMEX> cells medium were incubated
          for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15 min</TIMEX> at room temperature with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pmol</ENAMEX>/l plasmin.
          S251 was then added and after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX> incubation at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37</NUMEX> C
          the A 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">405</NUMEX> was measured to determine the
          conversion of the chromogenic substrate. Controls
          consisted of plasmin solution incubated with buffer or
          with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.0</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KIU</ENAMEX> /ml aprotinin.
          The human endostatin activity was tested in the human
          umbilical vein endothelial cells HUVEC proliferation
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assay</ENAMEX>. In short, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HeLa</ENAMEX> cells were incubated for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 days</TIMEX>
          with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad Adapt</ENAMEX> human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">endostatin</ENAMEX> and the medium was
          collected. Fibroblast growth <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor</ENAMEX> (bFGF)-stimulated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUVEC</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX> wells plate were incubated for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 days</TIMEX> with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hEndostatin</ENAMEX> infection medium. The proliferation of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">HUVEC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> was determined by measuring the incorporation
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BrdU</ENAMEX>. Levels of human endostatin in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat plasma</ENAMEX> was
          determined with a human enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assay</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ELISA</ENAMEX>) kit (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">InvivoGen, CA USA</ENAMEX>) according to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturers</ENAMEX> procedure.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tumour</ENAMEX> models
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">L42</NUMEX> tumour is a bronchial squamous carcinoma that
          originated in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Wag</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Rij</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> after intrapulmonary
          implantation of an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">iodine-125 seed</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] . L44
          adenocarcinoma was induced in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brown Norway</ENAMEX> rats by local
          irradiation of the thorax [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] . Both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tumours</ENAMEX> are also
          adapted to cell culture and give rise to tumours with the
          same histological characteristics as the original
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tumours</ENAMEX>. These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">carcinomas</ENAMEX> were serially passaged in
          syngeneic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 50</NUMEX> passages. The CC531
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tumour</ENAMEX> is a dimethylhydrazine-induced, moderately
          differentiated colon <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">adenocarcinoma</ENAMEX> exhibiting weak
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunogenicity</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> ] . The tumour is transplantable in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">syngeneic Wag/Rij</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX>. The subcutaneously growing tumour
          has a low microvascular density of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.4%</NUMEX> Â± <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.6</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>)
          and a volume doubling time of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 days</TIMEX> Â± <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.8</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>). For
          the experiments, the tumours were established in the
          flank of rats by implanting small pieces (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3 Ã— 3 Ã— 3 mm</NUMEX>)
          of tumour tissue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sub-cutaneously</ENAMEX> as described before [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41</NUMEX>
          ] .
          The size of the subcutaneous tumours was measured in
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> dimensions at regular intervals, using a Vernier
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">calliper</ENAMEX>. The volume of the tumours was calculated, from
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> tumour dimensions measures (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a</NUMEX>, b, c), with the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">formula V = Ï€abc/6</ENAMEX>. The doubling time of the different
          tumours was calculated between volume of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000 and 2000</TIMEX> mm
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>.
          Microvascular density (MVD) in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the L44</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L42</TIMEX>, and CC531
          tumours was determined as follows: When the tumours
          reached the size of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Ã— 10 Ã— 10 mm</NUMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sacrificed</ENAMEX> and frozen sections through the middle of the
          tumours were prepared. We used an anti-mouse CD31
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Diagnostica</ENAMEX>), that cross reacts with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">rat CD31</ENAMEX>, to stain specifically the endothelial cells
          that can then be easily selected by the image analyser
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">software Qwinâ„¢.</ENAMEX> The software allowed us to quantify the
          surface of the selected endothelial cells and to relate
          it to the surface of non-necrotic tumour tissue. The end
          value is the surface of all endothelial cells as
          percentage of the surface of non-necrotic tissue: the
          microvascular density.
          The global process including cell infection and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> production is commonly called in the literature
          adenoviral permissiveness. The in vitro permissiveness of
          the different cell lines to adenovirus was determined by
          infection of the cells by graded <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MOI of Ad5 Adapt</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Luciferase</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Luciferase</ENAMEX> activity was measured in the
          supernatant of the cell culture lysate after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 days</TIMEX> of
          culture and expressed in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RLU</ENAMEX> / <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">milligram</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. The
          in vivo permissiveness of the tumours was assessed by
          analysing the lysate of the whole tumour (without any
          surrounding tissue) <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 days after</TIMEX> injection of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adapt Luc</ENAMEX>. Adenoviral vector was administered in a volume
          of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100 Î¼L to 8 Ã— 8 Ã— 8 mm</NUMEX> tumours.
          For the metastases model <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the L44 and L42</TIMEX> cell lines
          were cultured in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dulbecco</ENAMEX>'s modified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eagle</ENAMEX>'s medium
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMEM</ENAMEX>) supplemented with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBS</ENAMEX>. When the cells reached
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX> of confluence, they were trypsinised, washed and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resuspended</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 4L44</NUMEX> tumour cells or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.10</NUMEX> 4L42
          tumour <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.5 ml</NUMEX>) were injected into the tail vein of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">syngeneic rat</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> were sacrificed after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX>

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wag/Rij</ENAMEX>), the lungs fixed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bouin</ENAMEX> solution and the
          nodules on the surface were counted. The first
          experiments, in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> were not treated, showed
          that all <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> developed multiple metastases in the
          lungs. The average number of nodules counted on the lung
          surface was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">58</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wag/Rij</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">93</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brown Norway</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX>.
          The volume doubling time of the metastases in the lung
          was extrapolated from the volumes determined at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> time
          points. The volume at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11 days</TIMEX> (for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the L44</TIMEX>) and at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> (for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the L42</TIMEX>) was determined by measuring the size

          the nodules on the lung surface was assessed, on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 22</TIMEX>
          for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the L44 and day 53</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the L42</TIMEX>, using a Vernier

          Luciferase assays in tissues
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Rats</ENAMEX> were sacrificed by an overdose of isoflurane and
          whole organs were dissected out, frozen in liquid
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">nitrogen</ENAMEX> and stored at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-80Â°</NUMEX>. Organs were homogenised in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphate</ENAMEX> buffered saline pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.8</NUMEX> using a blender. To lyse
          the cells, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DTT</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SIGMA</ENAMEX>, The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Netherlands</ENAMEX>) (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1 mM</NUMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Triton</ENAMEX>

          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lumat</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">951</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wallac</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Belgium</ENAMEX>). The amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> in
          the extracts was determined using a commercial kit
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bio-Rad</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratories</ENAMEX>, The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Netherlands</ENAMEX>) based on the

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bradford</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ] . The level of luciferase activity in the
          tissue homogenates was expressed in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RLU</ENAMEX> / mg <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. The
          background level of this assay is <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO"><1000 RLU/mg protein</ENAMEX>
          and was defined by measuring luciferase activity in
          organs of non treated <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          mhATF-BPTI determination in tissues
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Rats</ENAMEX> were sacrificed by an overdose of isoflurane and
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> was flushed out by cutting the vena cava and

          organs or tumours were dissected out and weighted, frozen
          in liquid nitrogen and stored at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-80</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C. Tissue</ENAMEX> and organs
          were homogenised in phosphate buffer pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.8</NUMEX> using a

          rpm for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 min</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ELISA</ENAMEX> was performed on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">100</ENAMEX> dilution
          of the supernatant. Total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> in the extracts was
          determined as described above. The concentration of
          mhATF-BPTI was expressed in ng / g tissue. The background
          level of this assay is < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ng</ENAMEX> / g tissue and was
          defined by measuring the mhATF-BPTI in organs of rats

          Statistical analysis
          Survival time until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">tumour</TIMEX> size of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> ml was analysed
          by log range analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kaplan-Meier</ENAMEX> curves. Analysis of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variance</ENAMEX> (ANOVA) was used to analyse the differences in
          tumour growth delay. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scheffe</ENAMEX>'s test was employed to
          analyse the difference between the numbers of metastases,

        Results
        
          Tumour characteristics
          Carcinomas of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lung</ENAMEX> were chosen, as it is the most
          frequent tumour in the cancer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. Several
          vascularisation phenotypes can be observed in the
          different histological type of lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>. Therefore a
          bronchial squamous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell carcinoma</ENAMEX> and an adenocarcinoma
          with different microvascular density (MVD) were selected
          to assess the inhibition effect of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATF-BPTI</ENAMEX>. The
          growth characteristics of the tumours are listed in Table
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">L44</NUMEX> adenocarcinoma grows <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">roughly 2.5</NUMEX>-fold faster
          than the squamous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> carcinoma <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L42</TIMEX>. This difference of
          growth rate holds for in vitro culture of the cells as
          well as for subcutaneous tumours and lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">metastasis</ENAMEX>.
          Probably related to the growth rate, the vascularisation
          of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">L44</NUMEX> tumours was significantly higher (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> <
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.001</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scheffe'test</ENAMEX>) than that of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">L42</NUMEX> tumours. The
          distribution of endothelial cells in each of the tumour
          is homogeneous in the viable part of the tumour. However,
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">L42</NUMEX> tumour develops a necrotic area with no vessels
          in the centre of the tumour mass as it grows above <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> Ã— <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ã— 8</ENAMEX> mm.
          The in vitro permissiveness to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Ad5</NUMEX> of the cultured
          cell line showed that the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">L42</NUMEX> carcinoma had a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> log
          higher permissiveness than the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">L44</NUMEX> tumour (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 1A</ENAMEX>). These
          characteristics are preserved in vivo when using the
          luciferase as well as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LacZ</ENAMEX> marker gene delivered in
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 Ã— 10 Ã— 10 mm</TIMEX> tumours. Luciferase activity, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 days</TIMEX>
          after intra <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tumoral</ENAMEX> injection of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> 10iu <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad Adapt Luc</ENAMEX>,
          was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> log higher in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the L42</TIMEX> tumours than in the L44
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adenocarcinoma</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 1B</ENAMEX>). The luciferase activity in
          various organs of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wag/Rij</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> is about the
          background level, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 to 2</NUMEX> log higher in those of the
          Brown <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Norway</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX>. Our interpretation is that a
          significant proportion of the vector escapes into the
          circulation and reaches the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> and spleen, because the
          L44 tumour cells are poorly infected by the adenovirus.
          These observations were corroborated by the results of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">intratumoral</ENAMEX> injection of the Î²-Galactosidase
          encoding adenovirus. Histological examination, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 days</TIMEX>
          after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> 10iu <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad Adapt LacZ</ENAMEX>, showed
          that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the L42</TIMEX> tumour preparations were almost completely
          blue whereas the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">L44</NUMEX> tumours showed few blue <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> around
          the needle track (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Fig 2</ENAMEX>). This inhomogeneous distribution
          is not specific for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the L44</TIMEX> tumour, as it was also
          observed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the L42</TIMEX> tumours when injecting a lower dose
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">virus</ENAMEX> (data not shown).
        
        
          In vitro activity of mhATF-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPTI</ENAMEX> and
          hEndostatin
          To assess the functionality of the vectors, the
          biological activities of the encoded transgenes were
          tested in vitro. As depicted in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 3A</ENAMEX>, the mhATF-BPTI
          expressed in the supernatant of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad Adapt</ENAMEX> mhAB infected
          A459 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> was able to inhibit <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70%</NUMEX> of the plasmin
          activity at a picomolar concentration (mol wt: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">25 kD</NUMEX>).
          Furthermore, mhATF-BPTI was shown to inhibit plasmin
          activity at the cell surface of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> aortic smooth muscle
          cells (RASMC) expressing <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> urokinase <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ]
          .
          The biologic activity of the endostatin encoded in the
          adenoviral vector was determined through the bFGF
          simulated HUVEC proliferation assay. A linear dose
          response relationship between endostatin concentration
          and percentage of inhibition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUVEC</ENAMEX> proliferation could
          be demonstrated (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3B). The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">ED50</NUMEX> of endostatin (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ng / ml</ENAMEX>) was in the range of published data [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] .
          Further, the angiostatic and antitumoral activities of
          the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">endostatin</ENAMEX> has been demonstrated in different
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">rat</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 27 28</NUMEX> ] .
        
        
          Secretion of mhATF-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPTI</ENAMEX> and hEndostatin in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>
          Brown <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Norway</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> were injected <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">intravenously</ENAMEX> with
          different doses of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad Adapt</ENAMEX> mhAB (from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> 8to10 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">10iu</ENAMEX>) and
          the concentration of mhATF-BPTI was assessed in the
          plasma at various time points post-infection. The
          detection limits of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ELISA</ENAMEX> in plasma is around <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5 ng /</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ml</ENAMEX>. The results, depicted in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Fig 4</ENAMEX>, show a linear dose
          response with a maximum level of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">500-800 ng / ml</ENAMEX> obtained
          when <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> 10iu <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad Adapt</ENAMEX> mhAB was injected <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">intravenously</ENAMEX>. A
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">linear</ENAMEX> dose response relationship was also observed in
          both <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> strains after iv injection of graded doses (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          9iu to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> 10iu) of vectors encoding the marker genes
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">luciferase</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">LacZ</ENAMEX> (data not shown). In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wag/Rij</ENAMEX> rats
          the plasma levels of mhATF-BPTI were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> times lower (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          5A) after the same vector dose. The plateau concentration
          after intravenous injection of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> 10iu <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad Adapt</ENAMEX> mhAB was
          around <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ng</ENAMEX> /ml plasma. In both <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> strains the plasma
          levels reached a plateau after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 days</TIMEX> and remained
          constant for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least 1 month</TIMEX>. The levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATF</ENAMEX> in the
          plasma were similar to those of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATF-BPTI</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brown</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Norway</ENAMEX> as well as in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wag/Rij</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5B).
          The human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Endostatin</ENAMEX> was measured in the plasma of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> that received <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> 10iu <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad Adapt</ENAMEX> hEndostatin
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intravenously</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5C). The concentrations of endostatin
          were much higher than those of mhATF-BPTI. The levels
          reached a plateau around <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> Î¼g / ml in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brown Norway</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> and around <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 Î¼g / ml</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wag/Rij</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX>. Otherwise
          the kinetics were roughly similar to those of mhATF-BPTI,
          with a plateau lasting for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a month</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> log lower
          levels in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wag/Rij</ENAMEX> than in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Brown Norway rats</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Effects of systemic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad</ENAMEX> mhAB on
          tumour growth
          The purpose of these experiments was to investigate
          the response to angiostatic gene therapy of the two
          selected lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumours</ENAMEX> with different characteristics.
          Firstly, we investigated the effects of systemic delivery
          of mhATF-BPTI on the growth of subcutaneous tumour
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">implants</ENAMEX>.
          Brown <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Norway</ENAMEX> rats bearing L44 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tumours</ENAMEX> were treated
          with intravenous injections of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad Adapt</ENAMEX> mhATF-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPTI</ENAMEX> daily
          for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> consecutive <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>. As depicted in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Fig 6</ENAMEX>, three
          different doses of vector were compared and a significant
          inhibition of the tumour growth (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.001</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANOVA</ENAMEX>) was
          observed with the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> highest doses (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">9iu</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5 10</NUMEX>
          9iu). <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Seven days</TIMEX> after the viral injection, the plasma
          concentrations of mhATF-BPTI were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 120</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ng</ENAMEX> / ml and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ng</ENAMEX> / ml respectively, which is slightly higher than
          the levels obtained after a single injection. In
          contrast, treatment of such tumours with a low dose of
          adenoviral vector (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> 8iu), that induced lower plasma
          levels of mhATF-BPTI of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ng</ENAMEX> / ml, did not significantly
          inhibit tumour growth. Thus it appears that the anti
          tumour activity of mhATF-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPTI</ENAMEX> is dependant on its
          systemic concentration. Higher doses could not be
          achieved without inducing unacceptable liver toxicity, as
          manifested by a severe inflammatory infiltrate and
          vacuolisation of the hepatocytes. Therefore <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 10iu</TIMEX> was
          the maximal accepted dose for these experiments.
          In a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> experiment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad Adapt</ENAMEX> mhAB and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad Adapt</ENAMEX>
          hEndostatin were compared (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>). L44 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tumour</ENAMEX> pieces
          were implanted subcutaneously on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 0 and 10 10iu</TIMEX> of
          each vector were injected <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">iv</ENAMEX> in a single dose on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 20</TIMEX>.
          The treatment with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad Adapt</ENAMEX> mhAB caused a significant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inhibition</ENAMEX> (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.0001</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANOVA</ENAMEX>) of the growth of the
          L44 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tumours</ENAMEX> as compared to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad Adapt</ENAMEX> empty or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad Adapt</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mhATF</ENAMEX> treated <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 7A). The human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">endostatin</ENAMEX>,
          which plasma level was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">around 10 Î</NUMEX>¼g / ml <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 days</TIMEX> after
          vector injection, showed a slight but not significant
          effect (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.007</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANOVA</ENAMEX>) on tumour growth compared to
          the empty vector. The mhATF-BPTI effect was achieved with
          a plasma level of mhATF-BPTI of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 800</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ng</ENAMEX> / ml between
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day 5 and 30</TIMEX> after the virus injection. It is required by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Dutch</ENAMEX> law to sacrifice <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> when the tumour volume has
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">surpassed</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> ml. That intervention precluded the
          continuation of the growth curves after the time point at
          which the first <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> is sacrificed. Therefore the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> with a tumours volume <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">under 20</NUMEX> ml were plotted on
          a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kaplan Meier</ENAMEX> analysis graph. The result showed a
          significant (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0,0001</NUMEX>, rank test) improvement in
          time to sacrifice showing an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad Adapt</ENAMEX> mhAB specific
          protective effect. In the control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>)
          reached the limiting size after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38 to 50 days</TIMEX>, whereas in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad AB</ENAMEX> treated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>), the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> had tumours
          above <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20 ml</TIMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">55 to108 days</TIMEX>. Mean time to sacrifice
          was prolonged by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30 days</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 7B).
          To complete the study, the same treatment protocol was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">applied</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wag/Rij</ENAMEX> rats bearing the slowly growing and
          poorly vascularised <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L42</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">adenocarcinoma</ENAMEX>. A single dose of
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 10iu</NUMEX> of the different vectors was injected <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">iv</ENAMEX> on day
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 7C). The plateau concentration of mhATF,
          mhATF-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPTI</ENAMEX> and endostatin were low, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">around 50 ng</TIMEX>/ml for
          the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 first</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">around 0.5</NUMEX> Î¼g/ml for the last
          respectively. No significant inhibition of the tumour
          growth was observed in either the mhATF-BPTI, the mhATF,
          or the endostatin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> as compared to the empty vector
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX>. We concluded that the plasma levels of our
          therapeutic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> were too low to induce any response in
          this model. In an attempt to improve this issue we
          studied direct injection of our vectors into the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tumour</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Intra-tumoral <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad Adapt</ENAMEX> mhAB <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> delays
          tumour growth in L42
          Adenoviral-mediated delivery of the mhATF-BPTI
          directly at the tumour site was studied in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the L42</TIMEX> lung
          carcinoma implanted subcutaneously into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wag/Rij</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX>. 19
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> after implantation, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> intratumoral virus injection
          (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 10iu</NUMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX> ml <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>) per day for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> consecutive days
          was performed and tumour growth monitored. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Seven</NUMEX> days
          after the beginning of the treatment, a significant (p
          < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0001</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANOVA</ENAMEX>) delay of tumour growth was seen in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad Adapt</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mhAB</ENAMEX> injected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 8A). The
          mhATF-BPTI plasma levels were under the detection limit
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ELISA</ENAMEX>.
          In contrast, local delivery of the vector to the very
          low permissive L44 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tumour</ENAMEX> did not lead to any significant
          tumour growth inhibition by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad Adapt</ENAMEX> mhAB (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 8B).
        
        
          Local concentration of mhATF-BPTI
          The results of the systemic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> in the
          Brown <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Norway</ENAMEX> suggested a correlation between the plasma
          concentration of mhATF-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPTI</ENAMEX> and the tumour response. The
          concentrations of mhATF-BPTI were measured in the plasma
          and in the tumour at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7 and 14 days</TIMEX> after intravenous or
          intra-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tumoral</ENAMEX> injection of the mhATF-BPTI vector (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). The systemic delivery of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> 10iu <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad Adapt</ENAMEX> mhAB in L44
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bearing Brown</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Norway</ENAMEX> rats resulted in a concentration of
          mhATF-BPTI in the tumour of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 1.2</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.8</NUMEX> Î<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">¼g / g tumour.</ENAMEX>
          This intra-tumoral level was maintained for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 2</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX> and is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> times higher than the plasma level. This
          suggests that mhATF-BPTI concentrates in the tumour. The
          concentration of mhATF-BPTI in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the L42</TIMEX> tumours after
          intravenous delivery of the vector was much lower around
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">150 - 160 ng / g tumour</ENAMEX>, but as in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Brown Norway</ENAMEX> rats
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2-3 time</TIMEX> higher than the plasma concentration.
          The local delivery of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> in the tumour
          resulted in a low concentration of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATF-BPTI</ENAMEX> in the L44
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tumour</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60 - 90</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ng</ENAMEX> / <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">g tumour</ENAMEX>) and high concentration in
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">L42</NUMEX> tumours (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 - 1.4 Î¼g / g tumour</ENAMEX>). This was
          expected from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> log higher permissiveness to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">adenoviral</ENAMEX> infection of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the L42</TIMEX> compared to the L44
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tumours</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Effect of mhATF-BPTI on lung metastasis
          In the subcutaneous tumour model, the majority of the
          tumour cells implanted die, and the surviving cells grow
          in the fibrous interstitial tissue of the skin. The
          subsequent angiogenesis give rise to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> small artery
          that will vascularise the whole tumour. This probably
          does not reflect accurately the clinical situation, where
          a primary carcinoma cell grows in a highly vascularised
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epithelium</ENAMEX>. The angiogenesis in non-small-cell lung
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">carcinomas</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> shows <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> different patterns of
          vascularisation: basal, diffuse, papillary and alveolar [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX> ] . The basal and the diffuse are the most frequent
          patterns found in squamous carcinomas and adenocarcinomas
          respectively. Both are accompanied by a destruction of
          the normal lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">parenchyma</ENAMEX> and the production of newly
          formed vessels. Our lung metastasis <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> in the rat
          also represent these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> main patterns: the L44
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">adenocarcinoma</NUMEX>) shows a diffuse architecture and the L42
          (squamous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> carcinoma) grows with a basal histological
          architecture. Further characterisation showed that the
          growth rate of the lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">metastases</ENAMEX> is roughly similar to
          that of subcutaneous implants, the difference between L42
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L44</ENAMEX> being maintained at both locations (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
          The protective effect of systemic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad</ENAMEX>
          Adapt mhAB was assessed by treating the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> with a
          single iv dose of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad Adapt</ENAMEX> mhAB, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad Adapt</ENAMEX> hEndostatin,
          or with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad Adapt Empty</ENAMEX> as negative control virus. The
          treatment was administered when the micro metastasis were
          a few <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> cells large as observed in not-treated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX>. This size was reached at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4 days after</TIMEX> injection of
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">L44</NUMEX> tumour cells and after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13 days in the L42</TIMEX> model.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> were sacrificed when the lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">nodules</ENAMEX> were
          expected to be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> mm diameter in the control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. As
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">depicted in Fig</ENAMEX>. 9Athe <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">L42</NUMEX> metastasis-bearing rats
          responded to treatment with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad Adapt</ENAMEX> mhAB with a more
          than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> reduction in the number of metastases.
          Macroscopic inspection of the lung surface and
          microscopic examination of lung sections gave similar
          responses. It is also noteworthy that treatment with the
          endostatin vector, which results in a much higher level
          of the angiostatic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1-3 Î¼g / ml</ENAMEX>), does not
          significantly reduce the number of metastases. In
          contrast, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the L44</TIMEX> lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">metastasis</ENAMEX> were not significantly
          influenced by either the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad Adapt</ENAMEX> mhATF-BPTI or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Adapt mhATF</ENAMEX> treatments (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 9B</ENAMEX>).
          Surprisingly, the systemic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad Adapt</ENAMEX>
          mhATF-BPTI does inhibit the growth of L42 lung
          metastases, but not of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">L44</NUMEX> metastases. In view of the
          high permissiveness of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">L42</NUMEX> tumour cells, it seemed
          possible that the lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">metastases</ENAMEX> were transfected with
          the mhATF-BPTI gene. Therefore the permissiveness of the
          lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">micrometastasis</ENAMEX> was estimated, by determining the
          Î²-galactosidase and luciferase activity <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 and 7 days</TIMEX>
          after the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">iv</ENAMEX> injection of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> 10iu <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad Adapt LacZ</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adapt Luc</ENAMEX> into <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> bearing L44 or <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">L42</NUMEX> micrometastasis
          in the lungs. The results were however essentially
          negative. The luciferase activity was under the
          background level in all cases and the sections of the
          frozen lungs showed no tumour <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> stained for the
          Î²-galactosidase in either <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L44</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">L42</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">metastasis</ENAMEX> bearing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> (data not shown, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>). Thus, it
          seems that the metastases are not actively contributing
          to the levels of mhATF-BPTI in the lungs and the
          concentration in the metastases should be similar to the
          concentration in the lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">parenchyma</ENAMEX> (all the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> being
          washed out). Therefore, the concentration of mhATF-BPTI
          in the lung of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> strains was determined. The
          results depicted on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3show</ENAMEX> that the mhATF-BPTI
          concentration is significantly higher (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.001</NUMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scheffe</ENAMEX>'s test) in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Wag/Rij</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> than in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brown</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Norway</ENAMEX> rats and is not influenced by the presence of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">metastasis</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wag/Rij</ENAMEX> rats concentrate the mhATF-BPTI
          in the lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">parenchyma</ENAMEX> about <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> fold, reaching
          therapeutic levels. In contrast, the same systemic
          treatment has no effect on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the L42</TIMEX> tumour growing
          subcutaneously, and this can be explained by the fact
          that tumour does not concentrate the mhATF-BPTI
          sufficiently.
        
        
          Influence of the tumour mass on the anti tumour
          activity of mhATF-BPTI
          Radio- and chemotherapy are usually expected to be
          less effective on large tumour mass than on small
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tumours</ENAMEX>. In contrast, it was shown that certain
          anti-angiogenic compounds (e.g. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Combrestatin</ENAMEX>) act the
          other way around, namely that they are more active on
          large tumours (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">>10 cm 3</NUMEX>) than on small tumours (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO"><1</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">cm 3</ENAMEX>). The supposed explanation of this peculiar volume -
          response relationship is based on the concept that the
          requirement for new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX> increases with the size of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tumour</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] . Nevertheless, this is not a general
          rule for angiostatics. Various compounds such as
          endostatin, metallo proteinase (MMP) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX>, and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TNP-470</ENAMEX> do not inhibit the tumour growth when its size is
          too large. Thus, large tumours that are richly
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vascularised</ENAMEX> might be more sensitive to angiostatic
          therapy. In order to investigate this issue in the case
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATF-BPTI</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> subcutaneous tumours with difference
          vascular density were treated at different time points
          (figure 10and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>). In the highly vascularised <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L44</TIMEX> as well
          as in the poorly vascularised <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC531</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">tumours</ENAMEX>, ATF-BPTI
          could significantly inhibit the growth of the tumours
          when they were around <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> mm3 at the time of treatment.
          In contrast, when the tumours reached a volume of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX>
          mm3, the treatment had no more influence on the tumour
          growth. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATF-BPTI</ENAMEX> (uPAR) is known to be
          principally present at the outer edge of the tumour mass
          and as the volume increases, the proportion of uPAR in
          the tumour will decrease. Thus, it was expected that
          large tumour mass were insensitive to the treatment. In
          this extent, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATF-BPTI</ENAMEX> is similar to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMPs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX>,
          in that their best indication would probably be for
          treatment of residual <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> or small metastases.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Agents</ENAMEX> that inhibit the growth of new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX> in the
        tumours include a wide range of different compounds. Most
        of them are not toxic for endothelial cells, but impair the
        dynamic process of cell proliferation, migration and matrix
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">remodelling</ENAMEX>. Thus, these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> are mostly effective on the
        formation of new <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX> and not on the pre-existing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vasculature</ENAMEX>. Accordingly such therapy is not expected to
        cause a dramatic shrinkage of an established tumour. It
        appears from the different clinical trials with endostatin,
        thalidomide, the synthetic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMPs</ENAMEX>, and the
        different anti-VEGFs that angiostatics, though slightly
        effective in advanced diseases, are more likely indicated
        in combination with chemotherapy or radiotherapy and as an
        adjuvant therapy to treat small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tumour masses</ENAMEX>, in
        particular local minimal residual <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">micrometastasis</ENAMEX>. In whatever situation, long term systemic
        delivery is considered to be the treatment of choice.
        Therefore gene transfer may offer an advantage. The
        potential of adenovirus based vectors to infect the liver
        cells after intravenous injection makes them suitable
        vectors for establishing a prolonged systemic delivery of
        the encoded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. However, our findings so far show that
        the achievable plasma levels of mhATF-BPTI are limited by
        adenoviral damage to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX>. To circumvent this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">limitation</ENAMEX>, direct injection of the vector in the tumour
        was employed in an attempt to achieve higher intra tumoral
        levels of the therapeutic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>.
        High levels of mhATF-BPTI were achieved in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">permissive L42</ENAMEX> tumour by local delivery of the vector and
        subsequently a significant inhibition of tumour growth was
        obtained. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wag/Rij</ENAMEX> rat liver is poorly permissive to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">adenoviral</ENAMEX> infection and accordingly systemic
        administration of the vector induces low plasma levels of
        mhATF-BPTI (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO"><80 ng / ml</ENAMEX>). Consequently, the intra
        tumoral concentration, though <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> times higher than the
        plasma levels, was not high enough to inhibit its growth.
        In contrast, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the L42</TIMEX> lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">metastasis</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wag/Rij</ENAMEX> did
        respond to the intravenous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> of the vector
        encoding mhATF-BPTI, though the resulting plasma level was
        low. It was observed that the mhATF-BPTI accumulated in the
        lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">parenchyma</ENAMEX>, independently of the presence of
        metastasis, up to a concentration of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 500</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ng</ENAMEX> / g. This
        fully explains the therapeutic response observed in this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lung</ENAMEX> metastasis model.
        In contrast, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">L44</NUMEX> adenocarcinoma cells have a low
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">permissiveness</ENAMEX> to the adenovirus. Consequently, in case of
        direct intra tumoral delivery of the vector, the tumour
        concentrations reached were low (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO"><90 ng / g</ENAMEX>) and tumour
        responses were not observed. However, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Brown Norway</ENAMEX> rat
        liver is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> times more permissive to the adenovirus and
        produced high levels of the vector-encoded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>.
        Additionally, the tumour tissue concentrates <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 to 3</TIMEX> fold
        the mhATF-BPTI from the plasma, resulting in high intra
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tumoral</ENAMEX> levels. Using graded doses of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad Adapt</ENAMEX> mhAB, a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">linear</ENAMEX> relation was observed between the dose and the
        plasma level as well as between the dose and the tumour
        growth delay. It appeared that a significant tumour
        response could be obtained when the intra tumoral
        concentration of mhATF-BPTI was above <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ng</ENAMEX> / g of tissue.
        In contrast, at the same plasma levels that inhibited the
        growth of the subcutaneous <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L44</ENAMEX> could not induce any
        response on the metastasis in the lungs. The tissue
        concentration of mhATF-BPTI in the lung of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brown Norway</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> was apparently too low (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO"><180 ng / g</ENAMEX>) for eliciting
        a decrease in the number of metastasis.
      
      
        Conclusion
        The tumour growth inhibition in both poorly and highly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vascularised</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L44</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L42</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">tumours</ENAMEX> was achieved only when the
        concentration of mhATF-BPTI in the tumoral mass or in the
        surrounding tissue reached a value of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 300 to 400</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ng / g.</ENAMEX> In contrast, mhATF and the human endostatin even at
        higher molecular plasma concentration than the mhATF-BPTI
        did not achieve any significant inhibition of tumour growth
        as in established subcutaneous tumours as well as in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">micrometastasis</ENAMEX> in the lungs. Other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> reported
        that at those concentrations endostatin and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATF</ENAMEX> induced
        responses of tumours and metastases in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31 32</NUMEX> ] . The
        absence of a response in our tumour model might be due to a
        lower sensitivity to angiostatic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>. In that case our
        results suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATF-BPTI</ENAMEX> is a more potent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> than
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">endostatin</ENAMEX> or ATF.
