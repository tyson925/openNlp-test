          Attention <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Network Task</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANT</ENAMEX>) as a suitable
          endophenotype for genetic studies
          While each of the attentional measures described above
          is well suited for genetic studies, we have chosen an
          alternate assay for genetic studies of attention. Our
          approach is based functional neuroimaging studies which
          have yielded evidence on neural areas involved in aspects
          of attention [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 20</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Imaging</ENAMEX> data have supported the
          presence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> related to different aspect of
          attention. These <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> carry out the functions of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">alerting</ENAMEX>, orienting and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX> control [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 22</NUMEX> ] .
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alerting</ENAMEX> is defined as achieving and maintaining a state
          of high sensitivity to incoming stimuli; orienting is the
          selection of information from sensory input; and
          executive control is defined as involving the mechanisms
          for resolving conflict among thoughts, feelings and
          responses. Functional imaging studies have shown that
          maintaining an alert state involves activation of right
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">frontal</ENAMEX> and parietal lobes while orienting to visual
          stimuli activates areas of the pulvinar, superior
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">colliculus</ENAMEX> and posterior parietal lobe. Executive
          function tasks activate frontal areas such as the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">anterior</ENAMEX> cingulate cortex and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral prefrontal cortex</ENAMEX>,
          an area for which certain anatomical aspects have been
          shown to be highly heritable [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . Recently, we
          described the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Attention Network Test</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANT</ENAMEX>) that measures
          the efficiency of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> major neural <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>
          ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ANT</ENAMEX> is advantageous for genetic studies, insofar
          as it distinguishes between separate functions of
          attention (alerting, orienting and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">executive</ENAMEX>) that are
          correlated with the activation of these specific
          neuroanatomical circuits. The heritability of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ANT</ENAMEX> has
          been examined in a preliminary twin study using normal
          adult <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">twins</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . The efficiency of the executive
          network was found to be highly heritable (h 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F 2</ENAMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.89</NUMEX>) while lower heritabilities
          were observed for alerting and median reaction time (h 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F 2</ENAMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.18</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.16</NUMEX> respectively). The
          heritabilities of these measures suggest that candidate
          gene association studies are reasonable to pursue. It
          remains an open question however, whether such candidate
          genes will relate to overall attentional performance and
          reaction time, or whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> genes will show
          specific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> with specific neural networks.
          As an initial assessment of this approach, we chose
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> genes (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DRD4</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">DAT1</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COMT</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAOA</ENAMEX>) that are
          among the most widely studied and repeatedly associated
          with various psychiatric disorders where attention is
          found to be disrupted. The longstanding interest in these
          candidate genes stems mainly from pharmacological
          evidence implicating dopamine and norepinephrine in
          attentional processes as well as biochemical studies that
          have related alleleic variants to differences in protein
          activity and expression levels. Studies showing the
          expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dopamine receptors</ENAMEX> in the anterior
          cingulate cortex [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] and that activation of
          mesocortical dopaminergic neurons via apomorphine
          enhances activity in the prefrontal cortex [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27 28</NUMEX> ]
          suggest that dopaminergic modulation influences the
          efficiency of the executive attention network. Similarly,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pharmacological</ENAMEX> studies with alert monkeys have related
          the alerting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> to the brain's norepinepherine
          system whose cell <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> are located in the locus
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coeruleus</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Drugs</ENAMEX> like clonidine and guanfacine act to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">block</ENAMEX> norepinepherine, and reduce or eliminate the normal
          effect of warning signals on reaction time, but have no
          influence on orienting to the target location [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ]
          .
        
        
          Dopamine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">D4 receptor</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">DRD4</NUMEX>)
          The dopamine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">D4 receptor</ENAMEX> is located on chromosome
          11p15 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] . Many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> studies have evaluated a
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX> base-pair variable <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">nucleotide</NUMEX> tandem repeat (VNTR)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polymorphism</ENAMEX> in exon <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">III</ENAMEX>. The most common isoform of the
          DRD4 contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-repeats, while <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> less common isoforms
          contain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-repeats and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>-repeats. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pharmacological</ENAMEX> studies
          show that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>-repeat isoform is less responsive to
          dopamine stimulation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] . Recently, a formal meta
          analysis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] was conducted on the growing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> of
          literature of this <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">DRD4</NUMEX> polymorphism and its association
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADHD</ENAMEX>. Based on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> case control studies (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> positive)
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> family-based studies (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> positive), the meta
          analysis concluded that a "...statistically significant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADHD</ENAMEX> and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>-repeat <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">allele</ENAMEX> of DRD4"
          existed, with a relative risk of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.9</NUMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> case-control
          studies and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.4</NUMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> family-based studies. In addition
          to the exon III <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">polymorphism</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barr</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ]
          examined the distributions of a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">120</NUMEX>-bp repeat <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.2</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kilobases</ENAMEX> upstream to the transcription start site and a
          single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) defined by a C to T
          substitution at position <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-521</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADHD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-521</ENAMEX> allele results in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40%</NUMEX> less DRD4 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">transcription</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</NUMEX>
          ] . Studies looking at polymorphisms in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">DRD4</TIMEX> and infant
          attention [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] as well as disorders such as obsessive
          compulsive disorder [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tourette</ENAMEX> syndrome [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] and
          schizophrenia [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] as well as underlying dimensions of
          novelty seeking [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39 40</NUMEX> ] , attachment [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ] and
          temperament [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ] have also shown <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX>. In this
          study, we examine each of these polymorphisms.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Dopamine</ENAMEX> transporter (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">DAT1</NUMEX>)
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dopamine</ENAMEX> transporter (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DAT1</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">SLC6A3</NUMEX>) gene is
          located on chromosome 5p15.3 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX> ] . Methylphenidate,
          the primary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">stimulant</ENAMEX> used in pharmacological treatment
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADHD</ENAMEX>, was shown by PET imaging to block the dopamine
          transporter [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADHD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> have also been found
          to show higher levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DAT1</ENAMEX> in the striatum [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX> ] .
          The most well studied polymorphism is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VNTR</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'
          untranslated region of the DAT gene [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX> ] . Since this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VNTR</ENAMEX> is not in the coding region of the DAT gene, it does
          not affect the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> sequence of the dopamine
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">transporter</ENAMEX>, but may affect the translational efficiency
          and thus the amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> expressed. Subjects
          homozygous for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>-repeat allele showed significantly
          lower <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dopamine</ENAMEX> transporter binding than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carriers</ENAMEX> of the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>-repeat <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">allele</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cook</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX> ] summarized the
          results of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an additional 11</NUMEX> family-based studies in a
          meta analysis and concluded that the association between
          the DAT gene and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADHD</ENAMEX> was highly significant (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> <
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">.0001</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Associations</ENAMEX> with other disorders including,
          bipolar disorder [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">49</TIMEX> ] , <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">alcoholism</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> ] and
          temperamental dimensions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">51</TIMEX> ] have been found.
        
        
          Catecholamine-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methyl transferase</ENAMEX> (COMT)
          The catechol-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O-methyltransferase</ENAMEX> (COMT) gene is
          located on chromosome 22q11 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">52</TIMEX> ] and catalyzes the
          degradation of catecholamines in conjuction with
          monoamine oxidase. In the prefrontal cortex, the
          breakdown of synaptic dopamine through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COMT</ENAMEX> pathway
          is more critical since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PFC</ENAMEX> is characterized by greater
          extracellular diffusion & slower clearance of
          dopamine than elsewhere in the brain [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53</TIMEX> ] . The most
          widely examined polymorphisms in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COMT</ENAMEX> were identified by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lachman</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">54</TIMEX> ] who found a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>-to-A change at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">codons 108</ENAMEX>
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">158</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COMT</ENAMEX> gene, resulting in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valine</ENAMEX>-to-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Methionine</ENAMEX> substitutions which account for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-
          to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-fold differences in COMT activity in red blood cells
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX>. A recent finding showed that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COMT</ENAMEX> genotype was
          related to performance on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wisconsin Card</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Sorting Test</ENAMEX>
          of executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cognition</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">55</TIMEX> ] . In addition, those
          subjects with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Methionine</ENAMEX> alleles needed less
          prefrontal cortical activity, as judged by fMRI, to show
          the same level of performance on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-back task. The
          Valine allele was shown to be preferentially transmitted
          to ADHD probands and was associated with impulsive false
          alarm errors on a continuous performance task [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">56</TIMEX> ] .
          Several studies on obsessive compulsive disorder have
          found <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COMT</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">57 58 59 60</NUMEX> ] .
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Associations</ENAMEX> with bipolar disorder [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">61</TIMEX> ] and
          temperamental dimensions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">62</TIMEX> ] have also been
          reported.
        
        
          Monoamine oxidase (MAOA)
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAOA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAOB</ENAMEX> genes are located on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">chromosome</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Xp11</NUMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">63</TIMEX> ] and code for enzymes that
          catalyze the deamination of biogenic amines including the
          neurotransmitters norephinephrine, dopamine and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">serotonin</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAOA</ENAMEX> shows expression primarily in neurons and
          preferentially catalyzes the deamination of serotonin and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">noradrenaline</ENAMEX>. Because of its metabolic role, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> which
          interfere with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MAOA</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clorgyline</ENAMEX> have been used to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">treat ADHD</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">64</TIMEX> ] . The most notable of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAOA</ENAMEX> polymorphism
          was a nonsense mutation that led to a complete loss of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAOA</ENAMEX> function in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> showing extreme forms of impulsive
          behavior and aggression [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">65</TIMEX> ] . More recently, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> with aggression was replicated in a study
          showing that maltreated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> with certain alleles of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAOA</ENAMEX> were more likely to show aggressive behaviors [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">66</TIMEX> ]
          . MAOA male knockout <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> also show high levels of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aggression</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">67</TIMEX> ] . Less severe genetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">variants</ENAMEX> are
          known to exist in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAOA</ENAMEX> which have been studied as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> to explain various dimensions of psychiatric
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAOA</ENAMEX> gene-linked polymorphic region
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAOA-LPR</ENAMEX>) is a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> bp repetitive sequence that resides
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1.2 kb</NUMEX> upstream of the start codon. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 and 4</NUMEX>-repeat
          copy alleles are the most common and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.5</NUMEX>- and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-repeat copy alleles are rare. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transfection</ENAMEX> experiments
          show that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-repeat allele results in a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-fold lower
          transcriptional induction than the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-repeat <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">allele</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">68</TIMEX> ]
          . The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> polymorphism we examined is a silent C to T
          change at position <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1460</TIMEX> in exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAOA associations</ENAMEX>
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADHD</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">69</TIMEX> ] , bipolar disorder [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70 71 72</NUMEX> ] panic
          disorder [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">73</TIMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">alcoholism</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">74 75</NUMEX> ] have been
          reported.
        
      
      
        Results
        
          Population distributions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT</ENAMEX>, alerting and
          executive scores
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table Isummarizes</ENAMEX> attention network scores and overall
          reaction time (RT) for the subject <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">distributions</ENAMEX> (not shown) for each endophenotype are
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">roughly</NUMEX> bell shaped, symmetrical and show that
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 70 %</NUMEX> of the variation lies within <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
          standard deviation. This suggests that standard
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">parametric</ENAMEX> statistical tests are appropriate for
          subsequent analysis. An examination of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX>-wise
          correlation coefficients for each network shows no
          significant correlation between alerting and orienting or
          executive attention and orienting, suggesting that these
          attention <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> are largely independent. Both alerting
          and executive attention scores showed correlations with
          mean reaction time (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 0.05</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.01</NUMEX> respectively) as
          well as a negative correlation with each other (r =
          -<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.18</NUMEX>, P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.01</NUMEX>). This negative correlation appears to
          arise because with no warning the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> are generally
          slower to respond and some conflict resolution may occur
          during the longer overall RT. To reduce the potential
          confounding effect of overall RT, raw attention network
          scores were divided by overall RT and resulting ratio
          scores were used in the genetic analysis.
          Since the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ANT</ENAMEX> relies on RT measurements, it is
          important to consider how non-genetic factors such as age
          and intrinsic factors such as speed accuracy trade-offs
          might potentially contribute to overall variation before
          proceeding to draw genetic inferences. Previous studies
          have demonstrated the overall slowing of reaction times
          in aged <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">76</TIMEX> ] . The mean <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> here <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>
          ± <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 years</TIMEX> is well below an aged range and no correlation
          was observed between age and reaction time (data not
          shown). Speed accuracy trade-offs constitute another
          potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">confound</ENAMEX>. If a subject responds too quickly,
          more errors are likely to be committed. On the other
          hand, the same subject may intentionally slow down to
          reduce errors and overall reaction times will be higher.
          Traditionally, this phenomena is addressed by the use of 
          d' as a dependent variable. In the
          study here, accuracy rates were high for all conditions
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.96</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.0</NUMEX>) permitting the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT</ENAMEX>'s and corresponding
          ratio scores. Lastly, it is also possible that gender
          differences exist in overall RT. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> was
          composed of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 %</NUMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60%</NUMEX>) and no
          significant sex differences (as judged by t-test) were
          seen for overall reaction time, alerting and executive
          attention.
        
        
          DRD4
          Genotypic analysis of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">DRD4</NUMEX> gene showed that the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">exon III</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</NUMEX>-bp repeat allele was present at frequencies
          of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.10</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-repeat), <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.72</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-repeat) and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.14</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>-repeat).
          Other rare variants were also present but not included in
          the analysis. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">120</NUMEX>-bp repeat <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alleles</ENAMEX> were present at
          frequencies of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.73</NUMEX> (long) and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.27</NUMEX> (short) and the C/T
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNP</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-521</NUMEX> was present at frequencies of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.43 and 0.57</NUMEX>,
          respectively. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chi-square</ENAMEX> analyses of observed and
          expected frequencies of each genotypic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> showed no
          linkage disequilibrium between the exon <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">III</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>-repeat and
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">-521</ENAMEX> site or the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">120</NUMEX> bp repeat polymorphism. The lack
          of disequilibrium between these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>-repeat
          has been observed previously [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34 69</NUMEX> ] . The distribution
          of alerting score, executive attention score and overall
          reaction time as a function of each genotypic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> were
          examined by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANOVA</ENAMEX>, linear regression and non-linear
          regression analysis. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">polymorphism</ENAMEX> was considered
          independently under a model where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alleles</ENAMEX> were treated as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">additive</ENAMEX> (AA vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AB</ENAMEX> vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BB</ENAMEX>) and also as dominant (AA vs.
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AB</ENAMEX> + <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BB</ENAMEX>)). The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">120</NUMEX>-bp repeat showed no significant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> with any attention network score or overall
          reaction time. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C/T SNP</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-521</NUMEX> showed an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">additive</ENAMEX>
          influence on executive attention as shown in Figure
          1Bwhere the mean executive attention scores of the C/C
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T/T</ENAMEX> genotypic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX> showed a nominally significant
          difference (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.06</NUMEX>). The exon <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">III VNTR</ENAMEX> was also
          examined in this manner. In this case, each genotypic
          class of repeats (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2/2</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2/4</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4/4</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4/7</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7/7</NUMEX>) were treated
          independently. No significant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> between
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genotypic</ENAMEX> classes and attention network <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scores</ENAMEX> nor
          overall reaction time were observed. Each genotypic class
          was also grouped into various larger classes (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-present
          vs. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-absent etc.). The results for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> such grouping are
          shown in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1A</TIMEX>. A t-test for equality of means (equal
          variances not assumed) shows that those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> carrying
          a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-repeat show significantly (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.004</NUMEX>) higher
          executive attention scores than the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,2 and 7,7</NUMEX> classes
          combined. Univariate linear regression of genotypes shows
          that DRD4 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">exon III</ENAMEX> genotypic variation contributes <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.9%</NUMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>-squared value) to the overall variation in executive
          attention score.
        
        
          COMT
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Methionine</ENAMEX> alleles were present at a frequency of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.39</NUMEX>. No statistical trends or effects for overall
          reaction time or alerting were found. As shown in Figure
          2A, a modest statistical trend toward additively higher
          executive attention scores was seen, and a post-hoc
          analysis shows that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 homozygous</NUMEX> classes (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Val/Val</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Met/Met</ENAMEX>) show only slightly different executive attention
          scores (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 0.1</ENAMEX>). Prior reports of sex differences in
          COMT expression in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">77</TIMEX> ] as well as effects of
          gender on behavior in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COMT</ENAMEX> loss-of<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">-function mouse</ENAMEX> models
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">78</TIMEX> ] and reports of preferential transmission of the
          low activity <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Methionine</ENAMEX> alleles in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OCD</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">79</NUMEX>
          ] suggested that gender could interact with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANT</ENAMEX>
          performance. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> were analyzed as
          independent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>, no significant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> were
          seen for overall reaction time or any of the network
          scores for either <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Females</ENAMEX> homozygous
          for the low activity <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Methionine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">allele</ENAMEX> did however, show
          the highest executive attention scores among all (Sex ×
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genotypic</ENAMEX>) classes.
        
        
          DAT1
          The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>-repeat allele was present at a frequency of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.75</NUMEX> and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>-repeat <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">allele</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.23</NUMEX>. As shown in Figure
          2B, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> homozygous for the rare <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>-repeat allele
          showed modestly lower score than the pooled scores for
          the more common <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>-repeat homozygotes and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/10</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heterozygotes</ENAMEX>. No trends were seen for accuracy, mean RT
          and/or the efficiency of alerting.
        
        
          MAOA
          Genotypes obtained at the promoter repeat (LPR)
          polymorphism showed frequencies of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.42</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-repeat) and
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.53</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-repeat) and genoptypes at the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">C1460T</NUMEX> polymorphism
          showed frequencies of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.55</NUMEX> (C allele) and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.45</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">allele</ENAMEX>). Since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAOA</ENAMEX> is located on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">X-chromosome</ENAMEX>, males
          are genetically hemizygous and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> are functionally
          hemizygous due to random <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">X</NUMEX>-inactivation. For this reason,
          heterozygous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> were excluded from the analysis.
          This permitted a comparison of hemizygous male and
          homozygous female <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-repeat vs. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-repeat classes only. No
          significant main effect or trend was observed for either
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAOA</ENAMEX> polymorphism and overall reaction time. As shown in
          Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3A</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAO-LPR</ENAMEX> showed a significant influence on
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">alerting</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 0.01</ENAMEX>) and on executive attention (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> <
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.05</NUMEX>) as seen in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3B</TIMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">C1460T</NUMEX> polymorphism
          showed no significant association with alerting, but
          shows a modest association with executive attention (P
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>). When the executive attention scores for
          subjects carrying <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the C1460T</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPR</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-repeat)
          haplotype were compared with executive attention scores
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> carrying <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the C1460T</TIMEX> (C), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LPR</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-repeat)
          haplotype, modestly significant differences (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.03</NUMEX>)
          were observed. This haplotype accounted for approximately
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2%</NUMEX> of the total variation.
        
        
          Comparison of 'high' vs. 'low' dopamine
          alleles
          Previous biochemical studies on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAO</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COMT</ENAMEX> have
          shown that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COMT Valine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">isoforms</ENAMEX> have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-fold higher
          levels of enzymatic activity than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Methionine</ENAMEX> isoform.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biochemical</ENAMEX> studies on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAO-LPR</ENAMEX> promoter repeat have
          shown that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-repeat <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">allele</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-fold higher levels
          of expression than the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-repeat allele. This biochemical
          evidence permits a noninvasive inference of relative
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dopamine</ENAMEX> levels among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>. In order to assess the
          role of dopamine on executive attention network
          efficiency, it would be useful to compare the
          distributions of executive attention scores for these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polymorphisms</ENAMEX> and ask whether those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> who are
          expected to have higher levels of dopamine (COMT
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Methionine</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAOA</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-repeat) show differences in
          executive attention when compared to those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>
          with lower levels of dopamine. Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4shows</NUMEX> the
          distributions for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> who carry the (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Val/Val</ENAMEX> and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4/4</NUMEX>) genotype and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> who carry the (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Met/Met</ENAMEX> and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3/3</NUMEX>) genotypes at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COMT</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAOA</ENAMEX> respectively. A post-hoc
          analysis showed that the difference in efficiency between
          these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> is highly significant (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0002</NUMEX>) and
          that this particular combination of alleles contributes
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.9%</NUMEX> to the overall variation. No significant differences
          were found between either the extreme 'high' or 'low'
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genotypic</ENAMEX> classes and each of the numerous heterozygous
          and compound heterozygous genotypic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX> whose mean
          efficiency values fell within the extremes (data not
          shown).
        
      
      
        Discussion
        
          Recommendations for molecular genetic studies on
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANT</ENAMEX>
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ANT</ENAMEX> is freely available for public download [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">87</TIMEX> ]
          . For <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> who wish to probe the genetic basis
          of executive attention, this study highlights many design
          and implementation issues. Firstly, it is evident that
          individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">polymorphisms</ENAMEX> exert extremely weak main
          effects. The results of this study show that a population
          of even <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> lacks the needed statistical power
          since the modest statistical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> are well below
          the standards set for the reporting of true <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">88</NUMEX> ] . In order to adhere strictly to these guidelines,
          power estimates suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">600</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> will be
          needed to reach these criteria for genetic studies of
          executive attention using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ANT</ENAMEX>. Other statistical
          approaches such as non-linear <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> or non-parametic
          tests may prove to be more sensitive when examining
          single polymorphisms or multiple polymorphic sites within
          a gene. Lastly, caution should be used when interpreting
          genetic association data on single polymorphisms since
          spurious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> may arise due to linkage
          disequilibrium at closely linked genetic loci. One
          encouraging aspect of this study however, is the finding
          that no <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> or statistical trends were observed
          for global measures of performance such as overall
          reaction time. This suggests that there may be
          specificity in the role of genetic factors in
          contributing to specific neural functions.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        Modest statistical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> of variation in
        executive attention were observed with genetic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polymorphisms</ENAMEX> in candidate genes that affect dopaminergic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">signalling</ENAMEX>. These <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> were not seen for global
        measures of performance such as reaction time, but rather
        for the efficiency of specific, anatomically characterised
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neural</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX>. This suggests that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ANT</ENAMEX> is a suitable
        endophenotypic assay for further large scale studies on the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genetics</ENAMEX> of executive attention.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Subjects
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Subjects</ENAMEX> were recruited in the vicinity of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX>
          Hospital via newspaper advertisement. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> who
          were recruited from the vicinity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peking University</ENAMEX> and
          participated in a previous heritability study were also
          included. Paid <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">volunteers</ENAMEX> traveled to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Psychiatry</ENAMEX> to undergo a pre-test interview. Subjects with
          a history of psychopathology and/or taking medication
          were excluded. A total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">220</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult subjects</ENAMEX>, ages <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18-50</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years old</TIMEX> met inclusion criteria. All <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>
          reported normal or corrected to normal vision. While
          smoking preference was recorded, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> reported
          smoking regularly.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Behavioral</ENAMEX> data
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">ANT</ENAMEX> was performed as previously described [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] .
          Briefly, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> viewed the stimuli and responses
          were collected via <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse buttons</ENAMEX>. Stimuli consisted
          of a row of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> visually presented horizontal black lines,
          with arrowheads pointing leftward or rightward, against a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gray</ENAMEX> background where the target was a leftward or
          rightward arrowhead at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>. This target was
          flanked on either side by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> arrows in the same
          direction (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">congruent condition</ENAMEX>), or in the opposite
          direction (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">incongruent condition</ENAMEX>), or by lines (neutral
          condition).
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>' task was to identify the direction
          of the centrally presented arrow by pressing one button
          for the left direction and a second button for the right
          direction. Cues consisted of a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> msec asterisk
          presented <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</NUMEX> msec before the target. There were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> cue
          conditions: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) no-cue, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> were shown a cross
          which was the same as the first fixation for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">100 ms</TIMEX>; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>)
          central-cue, which was at the central fixation point; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>)
          double-cue, in which cues were presented on the two
          possible <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX> locations simultaneously (both above and
          below the fixation point); and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) spatial-cue, cue was
          presented right on the target location (either above,
          below the central fixation point).
          A session consisted of a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>-trial practice <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">block</ENAMEX> and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> experimental blocks of trials. Each experimental
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">block</ENAMEX> consisted of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX> trials (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> conditions: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX> warning
          levels <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">× 2</NUMEX> target locations <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">× 2</NUMEX> target directions × <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
          congruency conditions, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">with2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">repetitions</ENAMEX>). The
          presentation of trials was in a random order.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Participants</ENAMEX> were instructed to focus on a centrally
          located fixation cross throughout the task, and to
          response as fast, also as accurately as possible.
        
        
          Calculation of attention network
          efficiencies
          Values for attention network efficiency were
          calculated from the raw reaction time data as previously
          described. Medians were calculated for each test
          conditions (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> cue levels by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 target</TIMEX> levels, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>
          conditions in total) to avoid the influence of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">outliers</ENAMEX>. The alerting effect was calculated by
          subtracting the mean <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT</ENAMEX> of the conditions with double cue
          from the mean <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT</ENAMEX> of the conditions with no cue. Since
          neither of these conditions provides information on the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">spatial</ENAMEX> location of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX>, the subtraction gives a
          pure measure of alerting. The orienting effect was
          calculated by subtracting the mean <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT</ENAMEX> of the conditions
          with spatial (up/down) cue from the mean <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT</ENAMEX> of the
          conditions with center cue. In both conditions the
          subject is alert but only the spatial cue provided
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">spatial</ENAMEX> information on where to orient. The executive
          effect was calculated by subtracting the mean <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT</ENAMEX> of
          congruent conditions from the mean <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT</ENAMEX> of incongruent
          conditions.
        
        
          Genetic sample collection and genotyping
          methods
          Buccal swabs were obtained via buccal cell brush from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consenting subjects</ENAMEX> and prepared as directed by the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">manufacturer</ENAMEX>. We used the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MasterAMP ™ Buccal Swab</ENAMEX> DNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Extraction Kit</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Epicentre Technologies</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madison</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WI</ENAMEX>).
          Yields range from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.5 to 3 μg</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> from each buccal
          sample. Yields were determined spectrophotometrically by
          absorbance at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">260</NUMEX> nm. Taq polymerase, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> buffer and
          dNTPs were obtained from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QIAGEN</ENAMEX> and used at recommended
          concentrations for a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> ul <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> reaction. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> reactions
          and restriction digests (PCR-RFLP) are optimized for each

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Controller</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MJ Research</ENAMEX>) outfitted with a heated lid for
          oil-free amplifications. For most markers, a 'touchdown'
          PCR cycling regimen and the addition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMSO</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> final
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">v:v</ENAMEX>) was used in order to automatically optimize the
          hybridization stringency. Gel electrophoresis in either
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">LE</ENAMEX> or Metaphor agarose followed by staining in ethidium
          bromide was used to resolve and visualise DNA
          fragments.
          For genotyping of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">DRD4</NUMEX> exon <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">III VNTR</ENAMEX>, primers were

          Statistical analysis of genetic vs. behavioral
          variation
          Attention network scores were calculated using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MS</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Excel</ENAMEX>. In order to perform genotype by network score
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associations</ENAMEX>, biallelic loci were assigned a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">'1'</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A/A</ENAMEX>
          homozygotes, a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">'2</NUMEX>' for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">A</ENAMEX>/B heterozygotes and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a '3</TIMEX>' for
          B/B heterozygotes. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SPSS</ENAMEX> was used to perform one-way
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANOVAs</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-tailed t-tests where genotype was considered
          an independent variable. Dominant effects were assessed
          by grouping genotypic classes. Based on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> analyses
          of the small effect size of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">DRD4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">exon III</ENAMEX> VNTR
          polymorphism, we estimated statistical power for
          genotypic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> for different sample sizes and the
          allele frequencies <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-present and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-absent (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.7</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.3</NUMEX>
          respectively). A minimum significance level for type I
          errors (alpha) of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 0.0001</ENAMEX> is based on the
          recommendations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lander</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kruglyak</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">88</TIMEX> ] . Using a
          computer-based power determination algorithm, a minimum
          sample size of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">600</NUMEX> is required to achieve a power of
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX>. A power of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX> was estimated for the current sample
          size. Linkage disequilibrium between pairs of alleles was
          determined using the method of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weir</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">93</TIMEX> ] . In this
          method, allele frequencies were compared to expected
          genotypic frequencies via <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">chi-square</NUMEX> analysis with a null
          hypothesis of no disequilibrium.
