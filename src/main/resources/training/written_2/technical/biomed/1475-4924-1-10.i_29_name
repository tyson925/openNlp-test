        The 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hedgehog</ENAMEX> ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hh</ENAMEX> ) gene was identified <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two decades</TIMEX>
        ago in 
        Drosophila as a critical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulator</ENAMEX> of
        cell-fate determination during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">embryogenesis</TIMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] .
        Subsequent work in several model systems has defined and
        characterized the 
        Hh gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> that encodes highly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conserved</ENAMEX> secreted signaling <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> (for review see [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ]
        ). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hedgehog</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hh</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are synthesized as approximately
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45</NUMEX> kDa precursors that autoprocess in an unprecedented
        fashion, resulting in the covalent attachment of a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol moiety</ENAMEX> to the amino-terminal <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of the
        precursor [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . This processed amino-terminal domain,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hh-Np</ENAMEX>, is responsible for the activation of a unique and
        complex signaling cascade that is essential for controlling
        cell fate throughout development and into adulthood [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] .
        In mammals there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hh</ENAMEX>-family <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sonic</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shh</ENAMEX>),
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Indian</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ihh</ENAMEX>), and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Desert</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dhh</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gene</ENAMEX>-targeting experiments
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> have demonstrated that the development and
        patterning of essentially every major organ requires input
        from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hh</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pathway</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] .
        
        In vitro culture systems of neuronal
        tissues have been used to characterize the biology of the
        Hh-signaling pathway. Most notably, the neural-plate
        explant assay has defined the concentration-dependent role
        that ventrally expressed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shh</ENAMEX> plays in opposing dorsally
        expressed bone morphogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> (BMPs) to pattern the
        neural tube [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . The assay demonstrates that the
        Hh-signaling cascade can distinguish between small
        concentration differences in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hh</ENAMEX> ligand to instruct the
        differentiation of specific neuronal cell types. Additional
        insights have been gained by utilizing cultures of
        postnatal cerebellar neuron precursors [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . These
        studies have shown that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hh</ENAMEX> patterns the cerebellum by
        promoting proliferation of the granule neuron precursors.
        Given the role that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hh</ENAMEX> signaling plays in promoting
        progenitor-cell proliferation, it is not surprising that
        misregulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hh</ENAMEX> signaling has been implicated in the
        biology of certain <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX>, in particular basal cell
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">carcinoma</ENAMEX> (BCC) and medulloblastoma.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hh</ENAMEX>-signaling pathway comprises <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> main
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">components</ENAMEX>: the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hh</ENAMEX> ligand; a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transmembrane</ENAMEX> receptor circuit
        composed of the negative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulator</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patched</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ptc</ENAMEX>) plus an
        activator, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smoothened</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smo</ENAMEX>); and finally a cytoplasmic
        complex that regulates the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cubitus</ENAMEX> interruptus (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ci</ENAMEX>) or Gli
        family of transcriptional effectors. Additional pathway
        components are thought to modulate the activity or
        subcellular distribution of these molecules [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . There
        is positive and negative feedback at the transcriptional
        level as the 
        Gli1 and 
        Ptc1 genes are direct transcriptional
        targets of activation of the pathway.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smo</ENAMEX> is a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">seven-</NUMEX>pass transmembrane <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> with homology
        to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-coupled receptors</ENAMEX> (GPCRs), while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ptc</ENAMEX> is a
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twelve</NUMEX>-pass transmembrane <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> that resembles a channel
        or transporter. Consistent with its role as an essential
        pathway inhibitor, removal of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ptc</ENAMEX> renders the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hh</ENAMEX> pathway
        constitutively 'on', independent of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hh</ENAMEX> ligand.
        Similarly, specific point mutations in the transmembrane
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">helices of Smo</ENAMEX> are capable of constitutively stimulating
        the pathway, effectively bypassing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Ptc inhibition</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] .
        At present, a controversy surrounds the mechanism by which
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ptc inhibits Smo</ENAMEX>. Although early studies suggested a
        simple, direct, stoichiometric regulation, more recent data
        support a more complicated indirect or catalytic model [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
        ] . And although it has been demonstrated that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hh</ENAMEX> directly
        interacts with [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] and destabilizes [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ptc</ENAMEX>, the
        downstream molecular events remain obscure. In particular,
        little is known about the means by which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ptc</ENAMEX> exerts its
        inhibitory effect on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smo</ENAMEX>, or how <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Smo</ENAMEX> communicates with the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytoplasmic Ci/Gli</ENAMEX> transcription factor complex.
        Through a 'chemical genetic' approach of identifying and
        studying the mechanism of action of small-molecule agonists
        (and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX>), we hoped to uncover some of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">complexities</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hh</ENAMEX>-signaling system. Small-molecule
        modulators of growth-factor pathways have proven valuable
        in providing enhanced understanding of the intracellular
        events that occur subsequent to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor activation</ENAMEX>, and in
        establishing the biological functions of these pathways [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8</NUMEX> ] . In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hh</ENAMEX> signaling, multiple insights have been gained
        through the use of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>-derived <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hh</ENAMEX> antagonist
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cyclopamine</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16</NUMEX> ] and a recently
        identified synthetic small-molecule Hh-signaling inhibitor,
        Cur61414 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . Interestingly, these specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX>
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hh</ENAMEX> signaling appear to function downstream of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ptc</ENAMEX> but
        their precise molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">target</ENAMEX>(s) and mechanism of action
        are unknown.
        Although genetic manipulations involving
        gain-of-function point mutations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smo</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] have
        demonstrated that the pathway can be activated
        independently of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hh</ENAMEX> ligand, no small molecules with this
        capability have been identified. Indeed, it has proven
        difficult to identify small-molecule agonists of any
        signaling pathway activated by a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein ligand</ENAMEX>. Two
        examples have recently been described, however. One
        involved identification of a non-peptide activator of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">granulocyte</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX>-stimulating factor (GCSF) pathway that
        appeared to act via <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor oligomerization</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] .
        Another report described a small-molecule activator of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX>-signaling pathway that also acts at the level of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] .
        Since the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Hh</ENAMEX> receptor, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ptc</ENAMEX>, serves to inhibit signaling,
        a small-molecule pathway activator would need to be capable
        of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the following: <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, interfering with the
        inhibitory effect that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ptc</ENAMEX> exerts on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Smo</ENAMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">activating Smo</ENAMEX> without affecting <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ptc</ENAMEX>; or <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX>, activating
        the pathway downstream of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smo</ENAMEX>. Identifying small molecules
        with any of these activities would provide useful
        information concerning the details of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hh</ENAMEX> signaling and
        would also provide a simple means of modulating activity of
        the pathway 
        in vivo or 
        in vitro .
        In this article, we show that a non-peptidyl
        small-molecule agonist of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hh</ENAMEX> signaling has been identified
        that has all the known signaling properties of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">recombinant Hh</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. But this agonist, unlike <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hh</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, appears to bypass the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ptc</ENAMEX>-regulatory step, by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interacting</ENAMEX> directly with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smo</ENAMEX>. Furthermore, studies with
        the agonist and several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hh</ENAMEX> signaling suggest
        that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smo</ENAMEX> can be activated or inhibited by direct
        interaction with small-molecule ligands. These observations
        suggest that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ptc-Smo</ENAMEX> receptor circuit may incorporate
        native small-molecule ligands in the regulation of Hh
        signaling.
      
      
        Results
        
          Isolation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hh</ENAMEX> agonists by high-throughput
          screening
          To identify small-molecule agonists of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hh</ENAMEX> signaling,
          we established a mammalian-cell-based assay. After
          testing several cell lines for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hh</ENAMEX>-dependent induction of
          the target genes 
          Ptc1 and 
          Gli1 [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] , we identified
          C3H10T1<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">/2</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">TM3</NUMEX> cells as optimal responders. We then
          introduced into each line a plasmid containing a
          luciferase <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> downstream of multimerized Gli
          binding <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> and a minimal promoter [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . An isolated
          stable clone of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10T1/2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell transfectants</ENAMEX> (referred
          to as clone <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">S12</ENAMEX>) gave a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10-20-fold up</NUMEX>-regulation of
          luciferase activity (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1a</NUMEX>) when stimulated with Hh
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX>. Using this assay system, we
          screened <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">140,000</NUMEX> synthetic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">compounds</ENAMEX> at a concentrations
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2-5 Î¼M</ENAMEX> and isolated several putative agonists. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of
          these molecules - Hh<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">-Ag 1.1</NUMEX> (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1a</TIMEX>,b) - was studied
          further. Hh-Ag <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.1</NUMEX> exhibited <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX>-maximal stimulation (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX>
          
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> ) at around <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3 Î¼M</ENAMEX>, and an activation
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">maximum</ENAMEX> (A 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">max</ENAMEX> ) of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 35%</NUMEX> compared to
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hh</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> control (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1a</NUMEX>). In the presence of
          sub-threshold signaling levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Hh protein</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.3 nM</NUMEX>),
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hh</ENAMEX>-Ag <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.1</NUMEX> was reduced to around
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.4 Î¼M</NUMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">max</ENAMEX> approached <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70%</NUMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1a</NUMEX>).
          We next tested whether expression of endogenous
          Hh-responsive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> was stimulated by the agonist. Using
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">quantitative PCR</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hh</ENAMEX>-Ag <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.1</NUMEX> was shown clearly to elevate
          the expression of 
          Gli1 and 
          Ptc1 in a dose-dependent manner
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1c</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Chemical modifications increase potency
          In an effort to improve the potency of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Hh-Ag 1.1</NUMEX>, over
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> derivatives were synthesized and tested in the
          cell-based <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> assay. The relative potencies of the
          most active <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">derivatives</ENAMEX> - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.2</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.3</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.4</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX> - are
          shown in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1d</TIMEX>. The most potent, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hh</ENAMEX>-Ag <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX>, had an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX>
          
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 1</NUMEX> nM. Thus,
          potency was increased over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX>-fold by chemical
          modification. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> of compounds <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.2</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.3</NUMEX> are
          shown in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1e</TIMEX>. Hh<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">-Ag 1.2</NUMEX> was the most stable
          derivative 
          in vivo and 
          in vitro (data not shown) and was
          used for most <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>-based assays. Hh-Ag <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.3</NUMEX> showed lower
          toxicity in embryonic tissue cultures (data not shown)
          and was used for the neural plate explant assays
          described below. These experiments suggest that the
          agonist may have many of the properties of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hh</ENAMEX> ligand.
          To specifically test this, we used <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> established 
          in vitro assay systems that detect
          the effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hh</ENAMEX> on primary neuronal precursors.
        
        
          In vitroassay of neuronal precursors
          
            Proliferation activity of the agonist
            It has recently been shown that primary neonatal
            cerebellar granule neuron (CGN) precursors proliferate
            in response to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hh</ENAMEX> stimulation [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . To determine
            whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hh</ENAMEX> agonist could elicit this response, we
            monitored [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3H</TIMEX>]-thymidine incorporation of cultured rat
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CGN</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">precursors</ENAMEX> treated with Hh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hh</ENAMEX>-Ag <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.1</NUMEX>,
            Hh<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">-Ag 1.2</NUMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicle</ENAMEX> (DMSO). The original active
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">molecule</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hh</ENAMEX>-Ag <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.1</NUMEX>, stimulated thymidine incorporation
            at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> Î¼M, but not at <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1.75 Î¼M</NUMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1f</NUMEX>). The extent of
            proliferation was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">around 50%</NUMEX> of that seen with a high
            dose of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Hh protein</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">50 nM</NUMEX>). Hh-Ag <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.2</NUMEX> stimulated
            proliferation at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> nM and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> nM to levels comparable
            to those seen with Hh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1f</NUMEX>). These data
            demonstrate that the agonists can elicit a biological
            response in primary cells similar to that produced by
            Hh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>.
          
          
            Morphogenic activity of the agonist
            Neural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">progenitors</ENAMEX> within the intermediate region of
            the chick neural plate (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2a</NUMEX>) respond to
            increasing concentrations of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Hh protein</ENAMEX> by adopting
            specific fates. The identity of these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> can be
            assessed by their distinct expression patterns of a set
            of transcription factors [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> of these
            transcription factors - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Pax7</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MNR2</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Nkx2.2</NUMEX> - whose
            expression is differentially sensitive to increasing
            concentrations of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Hh protein</ENAMEX> were assayed in response
            to varying concentrations of the agonist (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Hh-Ag 1.3</NUMEX>).
            The dorsal spinal cord marker Pax7 is normally
            repressed by low concentrations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hh</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . Pax7
            expression was extinguished by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1-10 nM</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">agonist</TIMEX> (Figure
            2b,c,<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">d</ENAMEX>,e,f). Higher concentrations of agonist (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>-200
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nM</ENAMEX>) induced expression of the motor neuron progenitor
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">marker MNR2</ENAMEX> (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2b</TIMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g</ENAMEX>,h,i,j), and yet higher
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">concentrations</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 nM-1 Î¼M</NUMEX>) induced the most ventral
            interneuron progenitor marker <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Nkx2.2</NUMEX> (Figure
            2b,k,<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">l</TIMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX>). This dose-dependent profile of expression
            closely resembles the response achieved by increasing
            concentrations of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Hh protein</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 23 24</NUMEX> ] ,
            demonstrating that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hh</ENAMEX> agonist mimics the

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Agonist</ENAMEX> site of action in vivo
            Having established an 
            in utero assay for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hh</ENAMEX> signaling,
            we next investigated whether the agonist could rescue
            aspects of 
            Shh - or 
            Smo -mutant phenotypes, by
            monitoring 
            lacZ expression in 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Smo -/-</ENAMEX>

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Pregnant mice</ENAMEX> from 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Shh +/-</ENAMEX>and 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smo</ENAMEX> +/-intercrosses were treated
            by oral gavage with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicle</ENAMEX> or agonist (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX>) at
            <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6.5 and 7.5 dpc</NUMEX>. Embryos were collected at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6-8</ENAMEX> somite
            stages (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">E8.5</NUMEX>) when the midline defects are first
            detectable in both 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Shh -/-</ENAMEX>and 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Smo -/-embryos</ENAMEX>, but prior to any
            general <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">retardation</ENAMEX> of growth and development [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 27</NUMEX> ]
            . In both 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Shh +/-</ENAMEX>and 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Smo +/-</ENAMEX>

            Ptc1 was detected in ventral
            neural tube, somites and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral plate mesoderm</ENAMEX> (Figure
            3e,i,<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX>). Treatment with the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">agonist</ENAMEX> dramatically
            enhanced and expanded the expression of 
            Ptc1 in these heterozygous
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">embryos</ENAMEX> (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3f</TIMEX>,j,<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX>). This was consistent with what
            we have observed in wild-type embryos (Figure
            3a,b,c,<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">d</ENAMEX>). It is worth noting that the agonist-treated
            embryos exhibited overgrowth of the headfolds and
            hindbrain, reminiscent of 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Ptc1 -/-embryos</ENAMEX> (compare Figure
            3e,mwith <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3f</TIMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX>).
            
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Shh -/-</ENAMEX>and 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Smo -/-</ENAMEX>embryos at this stage (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6-8</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">somites</ENAMEX>) started to show fused ventral lips of the
            cephalic folds, and a single continuous optic vesicle,
            indicating lack of a clearly defined midline (red
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arrow</ENAMEX>, Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3g</TIMEX>, and data not shown). As expected, 
            Ptc1 expression was not detected
            in the ventral neural tube of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicle</ENAMEX>-treated 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Shh -/-embryos</ENAMEX> (arrowhead, Figure
            3g), whereas expression was seen in lateral plate
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mesoderm</ENAMEX> and weakly in somites (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3g</TIMEX>,k). This is
            most likely due to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ihh</ENAMEX> signaling in these tissues [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX>
            ] . Both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shh</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ihh</ENAMEX> signaling were dependent on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smo</ENAMEX>,
            however, because 
            Ptc1 expression could not be
            detected in 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Smo -/-embryos</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3o</NUMEX>).
            Following agonist treatment, we observed that the
            neural tube and somite expression of 
            Ptc1 in 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Shh -/-</ENAMEX>embryos was greater than
            vehicle-treated wild-type levels (compare Figure
            3h,lwith <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3e</TIMEX>,i). The midline defects in 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Shh -/-</ENAMEX>embryos were at least
            partly rescued by agonist treatment (compare Figure
            3gand <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3h</TIMEX>; red arrows). Like 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Shh +/-embryos,</ENAMEX> 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Shh -/-embryos</ENAMEX> had overgrown
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">headfolds</ENAMEX> after administration of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hh</ENAMEX> agonist
            (Figure 3fand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">h</ENAMEX>). In contrast, agonist treatment had no
            detectable effect on either morphology or 
            Ptc1 expression in 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Smo -/-embryos</ENAMEX> (compare Figure
            3oand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX>). In summary, these studies demonstrate that
            agonist activity 
            in vivo does not depend upon <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shh</ENAMEX>,
            but that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smo</ENAMEX> is absolutely required.
          
        
        
          Mechanism of action
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chemical</ENAMEX> epistasis studies
            We sought to determine the level at which the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agonist</ENAMEX> acts in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hh</ENAMEX> pathway, in cultured cell
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assays</ENAMEX>. To begin addressing this question, we used the
            Hh <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> cell line to conduct competition
            experiments between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hh</ENAMEX> agonist and known Hh-
            signaling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX> that block the pathway at
            different levels (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4a</NUMEX>). These include: a
            Hh-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-blocking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5E1</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] ; a natural
            product derivative, cyclopamine [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 10</ENAMEX> ] that has
            recently been shown to act downstream of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ptc</ENAMEX>, perhaps
            at the level of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smo</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] ; a recently identified
            synthetic small-molecule inhibitor, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cur61414</TIMEX>, which has
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inhibitory</ENAMEX> properties similar to cyclopamine [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] ;
            and forskolin, an <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">adenylate cyclase</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> kinase A
            activator that is thought to block <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hh</ENAMEX> signaling by
            stimulating degradation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gli</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of
            transcriptional activators [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] .
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hh</ENAMEX>-blocking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody 5E1</ENAMEX> had no effect on
            pathway activation by the agonist (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4b</NUMEX>), while
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">forskolin</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4c</NUMEX>), cyclopamine (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4d</NUMEX>) and
            Cur61414 (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4e</NUMEX>), were all inhibitory. The lack of
            inhibition by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5E1</TIMEX> eliminates the possibility that the
            small molecule agonist activates signaling indirectly
            via stimulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hh</ENAMEX> expression. Furthermore, this
            supports the data showing that the agonist can activate
            signaling in 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Shh -/-embryos</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) and
            suggests that the agonist function is not only
            downstream of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hh</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> but also independent of
            the endogenous Hh-signaling modulators, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tout</ENAMEX> veloux and
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIP</ENAMEX>, that act via the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hh</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ligand</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . The competition
            experiment with forskolin showed identical inhibition
            curves for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Hh protein</ENAMEX> and the agonist, strongly
            suggesting that the action of the small molecule is
            upstream of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">kinase</NUMEX>-A-sensitive step in the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathway</ENAMEX>. In contrast, the competition experiments with
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cyclopamine</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4d</NUMEX>) and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cur61414</TIMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4e</NUMEX>) showed
            that Hh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> and the agonist differ in their
            sensitivity to these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX>. Specifically, the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agonist</ENAMEX> appears somewhat resistant to the inhibitory
            effect of cyclopamine and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cur61414</TIMEX>. Identical results
            were seen using the slightly less active
            cyclopamine-related natural compound <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">jervine</TIMEX>, and the
            more potent synthetic derivative of cyclopamine,
            KAAD-cyclopamine (data not shown). These results argue
            that the agonist activates the pathway downstream of
            the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hh-Ptc</ENAMEX> interaction while cyclopamine, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cur61414</ENAMEX> and
            the agonist may act at a similar level in the
            Hh-signaling cascade.
          
          
            Regulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ptc</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Smo by Hh</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> and Hh
            agonist
            Recent work in 
            Drosophila tissue culture has
            shown that endogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ptc</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Smo</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are
            differentially affected by the addition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hh</ENAMEX> to the
            growth medium [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . Ptc was destabilized, while Smo
            accumulated following post-translational modification.
            To test whether similar phenomena occur in mammalian
            cells with Hh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> and agonist, we generated stable
            cell lines expressing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two epitope</NUMEX>-tagged <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, Ptc
            coupled to green fluorescent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ptc-GFP</ENAMEX>, and Smo
            coupled to a fragment of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">influenza hemagglutinin</ENAMEX>,
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HA-Smo</ENAMEX>. Figure 5ashows an immunoprecipitation
            (anti-GFP) plus <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein blot</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-Ptc</ENAMEX>) analysis of
            extracts from these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> treated for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4, 8 and 24 hours</TIMEX>
            with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicle</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> nM <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Hh protein</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.2 Î</NUMEX>¼M Hh agonist
            (see Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1e</TIMEX>; Hh<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">-Ag 1.2</NUMEX>). This experiment shows that
            Ptc-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> appears to be destabilized by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hh</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> but
            not by the agonist. Similar results were seen at higher
            doses of agonist (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">up to 2 Î¼M</NUMEX>) and in several
            independent lines (data not shown). These data further
            support the idea that Hh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> and the agonist act in
            distinct ways to stimulate the pathway.
            Figure 5bshows <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">an immunoblot</TIMEX> (anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HA</ENAMEX>) of total
            extracts from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HA-Smo</ENAMEX>-expressing cells treated for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5,</ENAMEX>
            <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8 and 20 hours</TIMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicle</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> nM <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Hh protein</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.5 Î</NUMEX>¼M
            Hh agonist. In contrast to the results with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ptc-GFP</ENAMEX>,
            incubation of cells with both Hh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> and the
            small-molecule agonist resulted in the apparent
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accumulation of HA-Smo</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 hours</TIMEX> of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">incubation</ENAMEX>. To test whether the accumulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HA</ENAMEX>-Smo
            in response to Hh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> or the agonist required
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein synthesis</ENAMEX>, a similar study was performed in the
            presence of cycloheximide (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5c</NUMEX>). Under these
            conditions, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HA-Smo</ENAMEX> accumulation was detectable <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 hours</TIMEX>
            after addition of either <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Hh protein</ENAMEX> or the agonist
            (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5c</NUMEX>); this result argues that the effect of Hh
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> and the agonist on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HA-Smo</ENAMEX> levels does not
            require new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein synthesis</ENAMEX>. Finally, with increasing
            concentrations of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Hh protein</ENAMEX> and the agonist there is a
            clear dose-dependent increase of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HA-Smo</ENAMEX> levels (Figure
            5d). These effects on epitope-tagged Smo <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> were
            observed in multiple lines (data not shown). Taken
            together, these data suggest that Hh <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> and the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agonist</ENAMEX> share the ability to stabilize <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smo</ENAMEX>, but only Hh
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> can destabilize <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ptc</ENAMEX>. Yet the agonist is fully
            capable of activating the full signaling pathway.
          
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Testing Smo</ENAMEX> as the molecular target
          
            Binding in whole cells
            Our <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">biochemistry</ENAMEX> experiments (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">above</NUMEX>) show that the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agonist modulates Smo</ENAMEX> levels, and thus may activate Hh
            signaling by directly binding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smo</ENAMEX>. To explore this
            possibility we tested whether a tritiated form of the
            agonist analog <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hh-Ag 1.5</ENAMEX> could form a complex with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smo</ENAMEX>,
            when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smo</ENAMEX> is transiently overexpressed in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">293T</NUMEX> cells.
            Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6ashows</NUMEX> immunoprecipitable counts of extracts
            from cells incubated at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37Â°C</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 hours</TIMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nM</ENAMEX> [

            presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">competitors</ENAMEX> (columns <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4-9</ENAMEX>).
            Immunocomplexes from untransfected control and
            Î²-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">adrenergic</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor transfected cells</ENAMEX> did not contain
            significant counts (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6a</TIMEX>, columns <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1, 2</ENAMEX>).
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Immunocomplexes</ENAMEX> derived from cells expressing Smo
            (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6a</TIMEX>, column <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) resulted in the recovery of
            <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 40,000</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">800,000</NUMEX> added counts,
            however. To test the specificity of this apparent
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hh-Ag/Smo</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>, cells were incubated with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 Î</NUMEX>¼M
            (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1000</NUMEX>-fold molar excess) of unlabeled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hh Ag 1.5</ENAMEX> or an
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">unlabeled</ENAMEX>, signaling-inactive but structurally similar
            compound, an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hh</ENAMEX>-Ag <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.1</NUMEX> derivative that has a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-carbon
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">linker</ENAMEX> in place of the cyclohexane ring (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6a</TIMEX>;
            Hh<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">-Ag 1.5</NUMEX>, column <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>; Hh-Ag control, column <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). The
            addition of the unlabeled Hh<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">-Ag 1.5</NUMEX>, but not the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inactive Hh</ENAMEX>-Ag <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.1</NUMEX> derivative agonist control, resulted
            in the complete absence of counts in the immunocomplex.
            These results suggest that a stable, specific
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interaction</ENAMEX> can form between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smo</ENAMEX> and the Hh
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agonist</ENAMEX>.
            It has been shown that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hh-pathway</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cyclopamine</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cur61414</ENAMEX> block signaling in a
            Ptc-independent manner [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 17</NUMEX> ] and therefore may act
            directly on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smo</ENAMEX>. Having established a binding assay for
            a small-molecule agonist binding to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Smo</ENAMEX>-expressing
            cells, we next tested whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hh</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX> could
            selectively compete out binding of [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3H</TIMEX>]-Hh<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">-Ag 1.5</NUMEX>. To
            perform theses studies, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Smo</ENAMEX>-overexpressing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">293T</NUMEX> cells
            were incubated for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 hours</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">37Â°C</NUMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nM</ENAMEX> [
            3H]-Hh<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">-Ag 1.5</NUMEX> in the presence of either
            KAAD-cyclopamine at <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 Î¼M</NUMEX> (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6a</TIMEX>, column <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>), the
            related but inactive <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant compound tomatadine</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> Î¼M
            (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6a</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antag</ENAMEX> control <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, column <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cur61414</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Î¼M</ENAMEX> (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6a</TIMEX>, column <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>), or a related but inactive
            Cur61414 derivative (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6a</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antag</ENAMEX> control <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, column
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>) at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5 Î¼M.</ENAMEX> These data show that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hh</ENAMEX>-signaling
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inhibitors</ENAMEX>, but not structurally related inactive
            compounds, can significantly compete with the binding
            of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hh</ENAMEX> agonist to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Smo</ENAMEX>-expressing cells. This
            supports the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> that all of these small-molecule
            modulators of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hh</ENAMEX> signaling are direct ligands of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smo</ENAMEX>.
            We next asked whether a derivative of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hh</ENAMEX> agonist
            carrying a photoactivatable crosslinker could be
            coupled directly to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smo</ENAMEX>, to facilitate further
            biochemical characterization of the binding site. To
            perform this experiment we synthesized a tritiated
            diazirine derivative of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hh</ENAMEX>-Ag <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.2</NUMEX> with an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> 
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>-based assay of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> nM
            (data not shown). We incubated this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">compound</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> Î¼M
            with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HA-Smo</ENAMEX>- or control, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GFP-transfected 293T cells</ENAMEX> and
            subsequently ultraviolet-irradiated them to initiate
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">crosslinking</ENAMEX>. Fractionation by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX>-polyacrylamide gel
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electrophoresis</ENAMEX> and autoradiography of the resulting
            immunocomplexes from these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> showed crosslinking
            exclusively to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HA-Smo</ENAMEX>, but with an efficiency of less
            than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX> (data not shown). This result demonstrates that
            a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hh</ENAMEX>-agonist derivative can be covalently crosslinked
            to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smo</ENAMEX> in living <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX>. More efficient crosslinkers are
            required to extend these studies, however.
          
          
            Cell-free membrane-binding assays
            To test whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hh</ENAMEX> agonist could interact with
            Smo 
            in vitro , we transiently
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">overexpressed murine Smo</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">murine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ptc</ENAMEX>, rat <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Î²2</NUMEX>-adrenergic
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">293T</NUMEX> cells, harvested membranes and
            performed a filtration membrane-binding assay in a
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX>-well plate with [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3H</TIMEX>]-Hh<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">-Ag 1.5</NUMEX> added at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> nM.
            Figure 6bshows a bar graph of the bound counts from
            these binding assays (murine <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smo</ENAMEX>, column <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX>, column
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>; Î²AR, column <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>; <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">murine Ptc1</TIMEX>, column <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>; and a
            no-membrane plate control, column <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). The no-membrane
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> (column <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>) was included to show the degree of
            non-specific binding to the filter-plate apparatus. The
            Smo-containing membranes (column <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) are the only
            samples that exhibit significant binding above that
            seen in the absence of membranes.
            To assess the specificity of binding, we repeated
            the experiment in the presence and absence of a
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX>-fold molar excess of unlabeled agonist (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 Î¼M</ENAMEX>). The
            addition of 'cold' compound completely competed out
            these counts (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6c</TIMEX>, column <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> compared to column
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). To control for this observation, we added an
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">unlabeled</ENAMEX>, inactive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hh</ENAMEX> agonist to the binding assay at
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2 Î¼M</ENAMEX> (a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX>-fold molar excess). This <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">compound</ENAMEX> was
            unable to compete out the binding of [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3H</TIMEX>]-Hh-Ag <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX> to
            the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smo</ENAMEX>-containing membranes (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6c</TIMEX>, column <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>).
            These results argue that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smo</ENAMEX> and the agonist form a
            specific complex 
            in vitro , as predicted by the
            whole cell/immunocomplex binding assay (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6a</NUMEX>).
            Having established an 
            in vitro binding assay for the Hh
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agonist</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smo</ENAMEX>, we next tested whether the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ptc-independent Hh</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX> could selectively
            compete with the interaction. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Binding</ENAMEX> was assayed in
            the presence of KAAD-cyclopamine at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 Î¼M</TIMEX> (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6c</TIMEX>,
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">column 4</ENAMEX>), tomatadine at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 Î¼M</TIMEX> (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6c</TIMEX>; Antag
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control 1</ENAMEX>, column <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cur61414</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 Î¼M</TIMEX> (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6c</TIMEX>,
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">column 6</ENAMEX>), or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the inactive Cur61414</TIMEX> derivative (Figure
            6c; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antag</ENAMEX> control <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, column <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>) at <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î¼M</NUMEX>. These data
            show that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hh</ENAMEX>-signaling <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX>, but not
            structurally related inactive compounds, can
            significantly compete with the binding of the Hh
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agonist</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smo</ENAMEX> membranes.
          
        
        
          Kinetics, saturation and competition binding
          analysis
          Next, we sought to generate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX>, dissociation
          and saturation-binding curves, in order to derive
          affinity constants for the interaction of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hh</ENAMEX> agonist
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smo</ENAMEX>. To control for nonspecific binding we used
          either <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cur61414</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Hh-Ag 1.5</NUMEX> as unlabeled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">competitors</ENAMEX>.
          Similar results were generated if control membranes (from
          cells transfected with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX>, Î²AR, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ptc</ENAMEX>) were used to
          define the non-specific level (data not shown).
          First, we performed a kinetic analysis to establish
          the reversibility of the binding reaction and the
          approximate incubation time required for equilibrium
          binding studies. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Association</ENAMEX> assays were performed at
          37Â°C by combining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nM</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3H</TIMEX>]-Hh-Ag <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX> with
          Smo-containing membranes for various times prior to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">harvesting</ENAMEX> and counting. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dissociation</ENAMEX> studies were
          initiated by adding <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> Î¼M unlabeled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hh</ENAMEX>-Ag <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX> after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX>. Samples were then incubated for
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1-26 hours</TIMEX> prior to harvesting and counting. Figure
          7ashows the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> and dissociation phases of
          agonist binding to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smo</ENAMEX>-containing membranes. Using the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prism</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GraphPad</ENAMEX> software, these data were fit to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-phase
          exponential <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> and decay curves, respectively,
          and gave an association <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tÂ½</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">approximately 1 hour and a</TIMEX>
          dissociation tÂ½ of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">approximately 10 hours</TIMEX>. These results
          demonstrate that the binding of the agonist to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smo</ENAMEX> is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">reversible</ENAMEX> and that equilibrium binding will require
          binding reaction times of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">approximately 50 hours</TIMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five</TIMEX>
          times the tÂ½ of dissociation).
          Next, we performed a saturation binding experiment. To
          establish total, nonspecific, and specific binding curves
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7b</NUMEX>), we added a range of [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3H</TIMEX>]-Hh-Ag <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">concentrations</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.01</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> nM) in the presence or absence of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">unlabeled Hh</ENAMEX>-Ag-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 Î¼M.</ENAMEX> Identical results were seen
          if Cur61414 at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> Î¼M was used as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">competitor</ENAMEX> (data not
          shown). On the basis of the binding kinetics, incubations
          were carried out for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">approximately 45 hours</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37Â°C</TIMEX>, to
          allow for equilibrium to be reached. Using the Prism
          GraphPad software to perform non-linear regression
          analysis and curve fitting, we concluded that the data
          best fit a simple <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-site binding <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> with a predicted
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          d of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.37</NUMEX> nM for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hh</ENAMEX>-Ag <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX>. This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          d is in general agreement with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> values observed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>-based
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assay</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.37</NUMEX> nM as compared to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1 nM</NUMEX>).
          To further validate our binding results, we performed
          a competition assay using several <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">agonist</ENAMEX> derivatives
          across a range of concentrations (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.01</NUMEX> nM to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 Î¼M</NUMEX>).
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7cshows</NUMEX> the competition curves for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Hh-Ag 1.5</NUMEX>,
          Hh<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">-Ag 1.3</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hh</ENAMEX>-Ag <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.2</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hh</ENAMEX>-Ag <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.1</NUMEX>, and the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">signaling-inactive Hh</ENAMEX>-Ag <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.1</NUMEX> derivative described above.
          With the exception of the inactive derivative, these
          compounds all compete out the binding of [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3H</TIMEX>]-Hh-Ag <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX>
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.4 nM</NUMEX>) to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smo</ENAMEX>-containing membranes. These data are
          best fit to a single-binding-site competition model that
          predicts the following <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          i values: Hh<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">-Ag 1.5</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.52</NUMEX> nM; Hh-Ag
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.3</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.4</NUMEX> nM; Hh<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">-Ag 1.2</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> nM; and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hh</ENAMEX>-Ag <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.1</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX> nM.
          These <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          i values are in general agreement with
          the agonist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> values in cell culture for these
          compounds, with the exception that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hh</ENAMEX>-Ag <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.1</NUMEX> compound
          is not as potent in signaling assays (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 2 Î¼M</NUMEX>) as its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          i (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">96 nM</NUMEX>) might predict. This suggests
          an uncoupling of binding and signaling for certain
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agonists</ENAMEX>. Although binding affinities and signaling
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">efficacy</ENAMEX> can correspond for certain <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ligand</ENAMEX>/receptor
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">complexes</ENAMEX>, exceptions often arise [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] because binding
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">affinity</ENAMEX> does not necessarily measure the ability of a
          compound to induce an active <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor conformation</ENAMEX>. As a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> for these binding studies, identical competition
          experiments were performed with membranes from cells
          transfected with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX>, or with the Î²-adrenergic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>.
          No specific binding or apparent competition was seen
          under these conditions (data not shown).
          We next compared binding of KAAD-cyclopamine, Cur61414
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hh</ENAMEX>-Ag <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX> to a constitutively active mutant of Smo
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smo</ENAMEX> act) or to wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smo</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Smo wt</NUMEX>). The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          Hh-signaling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX>, KAAD-cyclopamine and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cur61414</ENAMEX>,
          have shown decreased potency on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smo</ENAMEX> act-expressing cells,
          leading to the speculation that they may bind this mutant
          form of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smo</ENAMEX> less well than the wild-type form [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 17</NUMEX> ] .
          We sought to determine whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hh</ENAMEX> agonist binds Smo
          actwith a higher affinity, an observation seen with
          certain ligands and constitutively active mutants of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPCRs</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] . To perform this experiment, we isolated
          membranes from cells transfected with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cDNA</ENAMEX> construct
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">encoding a tryptophan</NUMEX>-to-leucine mutation at residue 539
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">W539L</NUMEX>) of murine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smo</ENAMEX>. This oncogenic mutation has been
          found in human basal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> carcinoma [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] and the
          correspondingly mutated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> is capable of
          ligand-independent activation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hh</ENAMEX> pathway in
          cell-culture assays [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . A kinetic and saturation
          binding assay with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smo</ENAMEX> act-containing membranes showed
          that this mutant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> binds the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hh</ENAMEX> agonist with an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">affinity</ENAMEX> identical to that of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Smo wt</NUMEX>(data not shown).
          Using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smo</ENAMEX> act- and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smo</ENAMEX> wt-containing membranes, we
          then performed competition binding studies by adding
          increasing concentrations of unlabeled Hh<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">-Ag 1.5</NUMEX>,
          KAAD-cyclopamine or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Cur61414</NUMEX> in the presence of [
          3H]-Hh<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">-Ag 1.5</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.4 nM</NUMEX>). These binding curves (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7d</NUMEX>)
          can be fit to a single-site competition model. Although
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          i for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hh</ENAMEX>-Ag <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smo</ENAMEX> act-containing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">membranes</ENAMEX> was essentially identical to that observed for
          Smo wt-containing membranes (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">approximately 0.5 nM</NUMEX>), the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX>
          
          i values of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hh</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX> were
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX>-fold higher on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smo</ENAMEX> act- compared to the Smo
          wt-containing membranes for both KAAD-cyclopamine (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38.3</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">nM</ENAMEX> versus <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5.8 nM</NUMEX>) and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cur61414</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">309</NUMEX> nM versus <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">44 nM</NUMEX>).
          These results strongly support the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>, initially
          hypothesized for cyclopamine [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] , that the reduced
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">potency</ENAMEX> observed for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hh</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smo</ENAMEX> act-expressing
          cells is directly due to a reduced affinity of the
          antagonist for the mutated Smo <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. The agonist, on
          the other hand, would be predicted to bind to a site on
          Smo that is not affected by this gain-of-function Smo
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">actmutation</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        
          Models of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Smo</ENAMEX>-ligand interaction
          To interpret the results of the competition binding
          studies, we assume that the mutation in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smo</ENAMEX> act, like
          those in constitutively activate mutants of other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPCRs</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX> ] , indirectly influences ligand binding by creating a
          change in the normal equilibrium between the different
          conformations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smo</ENAMEX>. Thus, the mutation would not
          directly influence the binding pocket for either ligand.
          A simple <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-state model (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8a</NUMEX>) predicts that the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agonist</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ag</ENAMEX>, green square) and the antagonist (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ant</ENAMEX>, pink
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">circle</ENAMEX>) compete for the same site on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smo</ENAMEX> to activate or
          inactivate Hh-pathway signaling. It also suggests that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">antagonists</ENAMEX> should bind <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smo</ENAMEX> actwith a lower affinity than
          they bind <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smo</ENAMEX> wt, while the agonist should bind with a
          higher affinity, as it prefers the active conformation.
          Such a model cannot accommodate our observations with the
          gain-of-function Smo mutant. Thus we introduce a ternary
          complex model (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8b</NUMEX>), used traditionally to describe
          the behavior of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPCRs</ENAMEX> in binding studies with agonist and
          antagonists [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] , as well as constitutively active
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] . The ternary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> model for Hh
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">signaling</ENAMEX> suggests that there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> independent binding
          sites on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smo</ENAMEX> wt, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> specific for the agonist and another
          specific for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX>. Binding at either site would
          decrease the affinity for interactions at the other site
          (allosteric binding with high negative cooperativity).
          The agonist-bound form represents the normal activated
          state, while the antagonist-bound form is considered the
          inactive conformation. There are also other conformations
          that would not be bound, or would be transiently bound,
          by both ligands. A signaling pathway coupler, or effector
          (in blue), is proposed to bind the activated <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of Smo
          wtso as to generate a complex competent to initiate Hh
          signaling. Throughout the discussion the term
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">'coupler/effector</ENAMEX>' is used to describe an unknown
          molecule that binds activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Smo</ENAMEX> in such a way as to
          trigger signal transduction. The model further suggests
          that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Smo</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">actprotein</ENAMEX> resides in a stable conformation
          in the absence of agonist that is capable of forming an
          active <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coupler</ENAMEX>/effector complex resistant to antagonist,
          but not agonist, binding.
          Specifically, our data suggest that the agonist binds
          and stabilizes (or induces) an active signaling state of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smo</ENAMEX> while the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX> bind and stabilize (or induce)
          an inactive form. Furthermore, the gain-of-function Smo
          mutation renders the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> less sensitive to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inhibitors</ENAMEX>, presumably because the amino-acid
          substitution directly stabilizes or induces an active
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conformation</ENAMEX>. On the basis of a simple <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-state model,
          one might predict an increased affinity of the agonist
          for the mutant form, but in our studies binding of the
          agonist, unlike the antagonist, is not affected by the
          activating mutation, suggesting that a more complex model
          requiring <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">binding sites</ENAMEX> and perhaps multiple active
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conformations</ENAMEX> is needed to account for the observations.
          Thus, we propose a variation of the classic 'ternary
          complex <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>' (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>), a decades-old paradigm that
          has provided the foundation for describing ligand induced
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conformational</ENAMEX> changes of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPCRs</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] .
          Briefly, if this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> is applied to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hh</ENAMEX> signaling, it
          proposes that, firstly, agonist and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX> act at
          independent sites to select active and inactive
          conformations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smo; secondly</ENAMEX>, that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Smo</ENAMEX> engages an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">undefined coupler/effector</ENAMEX>, when it is in its signaling
          state; and finally, that the gain-of-function mutant form
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smo, Smo</ENAMEX> act, adopts an abnormal conformation that
          resembles the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coupler</ENAMEX>/effector-bound signaling state of
          Smo with low affinity for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX> but normal affinity
          for the agonist.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Activating Hh</ENAMEX> signaling through the GPCR-like Smo
          receptor
          As a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor class</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPCRs</ENAMEX> are considered excellent
          drug targets because they are often regulated through
          interactions with small natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ligands</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32 33</NUMEX> ] .
          Specifically, studies of classic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPCRs</ENAMEX>, such as the
          Î²-adrenergic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>, show that in the absence of
          endogenous ligand (agonists) these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> exist in
          multiple interconvertible conformations that are
          predominately inactive [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] . Upon exposure to their
          natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ligands</ENAMEX>, however, the active <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> forms are
          preferentially stabilized, allowing them to readily
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">engage G</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein couplers</ENAMEX> and to create
          signaling-competent <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX>. Multiple compound classes
          have been isolated on the basis of their ability to
          compete for the binding of Î²-adrenergic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> by
          their natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ligands</ENAMEX>. These <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">competitors</ENAMEX> can mimic the
          natural ligand activity (agonists) or interfere with it
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX>).
          In addition to the binding sites for natural or
          endogenous agonists (orthosteric sites), many GPCRs have
          also been found to have allosteric sites [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] . These
          sites can bind natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ligands</ENAMEX>, as in the case of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zn</ENAMEX> ions
          and heparin for the dopamine and neurokinin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>,
          respectively, or bind synthetic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> such gallamine, in
          the case of the muscarinic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] . Binding of
          small molecules to these allosteric sites can modulate
          activity of a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> without directly mimicking or
          competing out the interaction of ligands to the
          orthosteric <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX>. In summary, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPCRs</ENAMEX> have an array of
          potential regulatory binding sites, or potential drug
          targets.
          How does <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smo</ENAMEX> compare with other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPCRs</ENAMEX> with regard to
          the properties described above? Although there is clear
          structural homology between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smo</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPCRs</ENAMEX>,
          endogenous ligands have yet to be discovered. Early
          models of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hh</ENAMEX> signaling proposed a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hh</ENAMEX>-regulated Ptc-Smo
          complex that directly controlled the conformation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smo</ENAMEX>,
          making endogenous ligands unnecessary. But recent studies
          argue against this stoichiometric model [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5 36</ENAMEX> ] ,
          indicating that perhaps natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ligands</ENAMEX> should be
          considered. Furthermore, regarding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-effector
          coupling for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smo</ENAMEX>, the results are also equivocal.
          Although no compelling data have been presented that
          directly link classic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein activation</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">canonical Hh</ENAMEX> pathway involving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ci/Gli</ENAMEX> stimulation [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] ,
          recent studies show that under certain conditions Smo can
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">engage G</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein subunits</ENAMEX> in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ptc</ENAMEX>-dependent manner [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38</NUMEX>
          ] and that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-mediated <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cAMP modulation</ENAMEX> may
          underlie certain effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hh</ENAMEX> on neuronal tissue [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ]
          .
          Finally, with respect to pharmacological properties,
          our studies indicate that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smo</ENAMEX> behaves like a classic GPCR
          in many regards and that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> used to describe this
          large <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> can be applied to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hh</ENAMEX> signaling
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> relatively novel concepts for Hh
          signaling are raised by these GPCR <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX>: firstly, the
          importance of considering the active <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Smo-coupler</ENAMEX>/effector
          complexes when modeling pathway regulation, and secondly
          the potential for endogenous ligands in the regulation of
          Smo activity.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GPCR</ENAMEX> models for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smo</ENAMEX> and potential mechanisms of Ptc
          function
          A recent study in 
          Drosophila suggested that Hh
          stimulates the pathway via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ptc</ENAMEX> degradation and, as a
          result, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smo</ENAMEX> is stabilized through extensive
          phosphorylation at the plasma membrane where it initiates
          signaling [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . This led to speculation that a
          Ptc-regulated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">phosphatase</ENAMEX> may control the subcellular
          distribution and stability of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smo</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . Although
          suggestive, the studies in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> did not establish that
          phosphorylation, translocation or stabilization of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smo</ENAMEX> is
          required for pathway stimulation. It is plausible that
          some or all of these effects on Smo result from a
          feedback inhibition mechanism that targets the activated
          Smo <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>. Interestingly, while we did observe
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">stabilization of Smo by Hh</ENAMEX> in our mammalian cell
          experiments (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>), we did not detect Smo
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylation</ENAMEX> or translocation to the plasma membrane
          (data not shown). Perhaps the cellular (or species)
          context dictates the degree to which the active
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">conformations of Smo</ENAMEX> are associated with such changes.
          Thus, in considering models of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ptc</ENAMEX> function based on
          Hh-stimulated effects it is important to consider whether
          the form of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smo</ENAMEX> that is being observed is the active
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">coupler/effector bound</ENAMEX>) signaling <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, or perhaps a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">downregulated</ENAMEX> and inactive form.
          Several potential points for regulation by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ptc</ENAMEX> during
          the formation of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Smo-coupler</ENAMEX>/effector <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> are
          apparent in a ternary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> model. The ideas proposed
          for the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> system, in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ptc</ENAMEX> may
          affect the levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smo</ENAMEX> or its subcellular localization,
          are easily accommodated. Ptc-induced instability of Smo
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> would indirectly reduce the concentration of an
          active <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Smo-coupler</ENAMEX>/effector <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>. Furthermore,
          limiting access of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smo</ENAMEX> to its effector through targeted
          vesicle trafficking would prevent a signaling-competent
          complex from forming. Alternatively, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ptc</ENAMEX> could more
          directly maintain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smo</ENAMEX> in an inactive <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. On the basis
          of our studies it is tempting to speculate that native
          small molecules with properties similar to our agonist
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX> act directly on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smo</ENAMEX> in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ptc</ENAMEX>-dependent
          manner. These putative endogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smo</ENAMEX> modulators could
          represent orthosteric or allosteric ligands.
          The simplest model would have <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Ptc</ENAMEX> acting catalytically
          to dock a natural antagonist directly onto (or remove an
          agonist from) Smo. A more complex model would involve Ptc
          restricting the distribution of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Smo</ENAMEX> such that it is
          forced into <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">compartments</ENAMEX> containing the natural
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">antagonists</ENAMEX> or lacking the natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">agonists</ENAMEX>. Finally, Ptc
          could control the distribution of the endogenous
          small-molecule modulators themselves. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ptc</ENAMEX> shares sequence
          homology with molecules associated with vesicle
          trafficking and transporter activity, namely <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCAP</ENAMEX> and
          NPC1 [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36 40 41 42</NUMEX> ] ; if it also shares the activities
          of these molecules, as suggested by a recent study [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ]
          , then the possibility of the existence of endogenous Smo
          ligands that are docked via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ptc</ENAMEX> should be explored.
        
        
          Therapeutic potential of a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hh</ENAMEX>-pathway
          agonist
          Various studies in mammals have shown that 
          Hh genes are expressed in discrete
          <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">areas</ENAMEX> of the adult <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> and may function in the
          normal maintenance of mature organ systems [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43 44 45 46</NUMEX>
          ] . In addition, the regenerative healing of vascular and
          skeletal tissues following acute injuries appears to be
          aided by re-activating the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hh</ENAMEX>-signaling cascade [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47 48</NUMEX> ]
          . Taken together, these observations suggest that the Hh
          pathway may represent a point of intervention for
          treating certain degenerative <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disorders</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> recent
          studies in models of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Parkinson's disease</ENAMEX> and peripheral
          nerve damage support this claim, by demonstrating that
          pathway activation with a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hh</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein ligand</ENAMEX> has
          therapeutic value [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">49 50</NUMEX> ] . On the basis of our current
          understanding of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> and the specific mechanism
          of action of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hh</ENAMEX> agonists, we predict that an
          agonist-derivative with low toxicity and favorable
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pharmacokinetics</ENAMEX> would replicate these positive results.
          As a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hh</ENAMEX> agonist would represent an attractive
          alternative to an expensive <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hh-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> therapeutic.
          Beyond the economics, for disorders of the central
          nervous system a small molecule with the potential to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX>-brain barrier would eliminate the need
          for injections directly into the brain, the current
          delivery mode for central nervous system protein
          therapies.

          The compound <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> used in our screens were
          purchased from a number of commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">vendors</ENAMEX> and were
          primarily generated by combinatorial chemistry
          approaches. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hh</ENAMEX>-agonist class was isolated from a

          now <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EvotecOAI</ENAMEX>. The derivatization of this compound class

          Retroviral cell lines
          Mouse 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smo</ENAMEX> and

          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Palo Alto</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>) to limit the copy number per cell. Stable
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HA-Smo</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ptc</ENAMEX>-GFP lines were established by puromycin
          selection following infection of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">TM3</NUMEX> cells with the

          epitope-tagged <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ptc</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smo</ENAMEX> were derived by infecting
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> with an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HA-Smo</ENAMEX> construct and subsequently with a
          Ptc-GFP construct. The levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ptc</ENAMEX> were relatively low
          in these lines and a standard immunoprecipitation
          procedure followed by western blotting was required to
