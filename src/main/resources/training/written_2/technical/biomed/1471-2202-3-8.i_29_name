        The prostate gland is part of the male genitalia and its
        function is to secrete fluid that is released with the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ejaculate</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">copulation</TIMEX>. The prostate surrounds the
        urethra just distal to the urinary bladder and proximal to
        the external urethral sphincter [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] and is composed of
        smooth muscle and secretory alveoli. Nervous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">innervation</ENAMEX> of
        the prostate is believed to be mainly sympathetic [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] .
        These nerves descend through the hypogastric nerves and
        synapse on postganglionic neurons in the pelvic plexus
        (major pelvic ganglion in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX>) from which the prostate
        receives direct innervation. The sympathetic nervous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">innervation</ENAMEX> is split into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> portions: postganglionic
        adrenergic nerves that synapse on blood vessels and the
        smooth muscle that surround the alveoli, and sympathetic
        cholinergic nerves that innervate the glandular epithelium.
        Thus control of prostatic secretion is mediated by a
        sympathetic cholinergic pathway. Evidence for
        parasympathetic innervation of the prostate is present but
        its function is largely unknown. Speculation suggests some
        form of control of the volume or composition of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">secretion</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . There is also evidence for the presence
        of periprostatic ganglia and capsular ganglia respectively
        outside and inside the prostatic capsule [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] but not much
        is known about their pharmacology or function.
        The urinary bladder functions to store and expel urine [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> ] . It has both sympathetic and parasympathetic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">innervation</ENAMEX>. The parasympathetic innervation arises from
        preganglionic neurons located in the distal lumbar and
        proximal sacral spinal cord (segments <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L6 and S1</TIMEX> in the rat
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7</NUMEX> ] ) and whose axons are found in the pelvic nerve and
        synapse on postganglionic neurons in the pelvic plexus.
        Parasympathetic impulses are the main excitatory influence
        and contract the bladder causing emptying. The sympathetic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">innervation</ENAMEX> is mainly concerned with the storage function
        of the bladder [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] .
        Thus there is major and fundamentally different
        innervation of the bladder and the prostate. However in
        humans the prostate can affect the micturition function
        since when a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> ages and the prostate enlarges it
        constricts the urethral lumen. This condition is commonly
        known as benign prostatic hypertrophy and seriously affects
        the micturition function of the bladder. Although the
        effect of prostatic enlargement on the bladder is primarily
        mechanical it is possible that in time it might also alter
        the neuronal circuitry that mediates micturition. In view
        of the aforementioned considerations and despite prior
        knowledge about the separate functions and innervation of
        these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> organs we thought it worthwhile to examine the
        neuroanatomical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> of the bladder and the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">prostate</ENAMEX> simultaneously within a single venue. We undertook
        this study to answer questions not previously addressed by
        other investigations, namely: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) Are the lumbosacral
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">parasympathetic</ENAMEX> and sympathetic preganglionic neurons that
        innervate the bladder different from those that innervate
        the prostate, or to what extent do they dually innervate
        these organs? (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) Are the lumbosacral interneurons that are
        part of the pathways innervating these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> organs separate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of interneurons or do they participate in the
        innervation of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> organs? (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) Are the supraspinal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">areas</ENAMEX> involved in innervating these organs separate or do
        they contribute to the innervation of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> organs? To
        do this we have employed the unique technique of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
        immunohistochemically distinguishable pseudorabies viruses,
        which will simultaneously be injected, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to each organ,
        as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">neuroanatomical tracers</ENAMEX> to determine each of the central
        nervous system distributions [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 10</ENAMEX> ] .
      
      
        Results
        
          Major pelvic ganglion
          The major pelvic ganglion contains the postganglionic
          neurons that innervate both the urinary bladder and the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">prostate</ENAMEX>. Therefore these neurons are the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> neurons
          to be labeled by virus arriving from either of the
          injected organs. Figure 1depicts bladder and prostate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neurons</ENAMEX> in the major pelvic ganglion <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three days</TIMEX> post
          infection. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">neurons</ENAMEX> labeled by virus from the prostate
          were larger than those that were labeled by virus from
          the bladder. Also shown are adrenergic prostate neurons
          that were stained by the antiserum to tyrosine
          hydroxylase as well as prostate neurons that are not
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adrenergic</ENAMEX>. A count of these prostate neurons revealed
          that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 77%</NUMEX> were adrenergic.
        
        
          Spinal cord
          The different categories of labeled neurons were: B:
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neurons</ENAMEX> labeled by virus injected into the urinary
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bladder; P</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neurons</ENAMEX> labeled by virus injected into the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prostate; BChAT</ENAMEX> (or BCh): <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neurons</ENAMEX> labeled by virus
          injected into the urinary bladder that were also
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cholinergic; PChAT</ENAMEX> (or PCh): <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neurons</ENAMEX> labeled by virus
          injected into the prostate that were also cholinergic;
          DBL: <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neurons</ENAMEX> labeled by both viruses (no double-labeled
          neurons were also cholinergic). The areas in which these
          different categories of neurons were located are: IML:
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">intermediolateral</ENAMEX> area; DGC: dorsal gray commissure; SDH:
          superficial dorsal horn. Note that all cholinergic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neurons</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BChAT</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PChAT</ENAMEX>) were considered to be
          preganglionic neurons. Virus-labeled neurons that were
          not also cholinergic were, by definition,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interneurons</ENAMEX>.
          Virus-labeled neurons in lumbosacral spinal cord first
          appeared <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2.25 days</TIMEX> post-infection. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1and Figures 2</ENAMEX>,
          3and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4display</TIMEX> the means and standard errors of numbers of
          labeled neurons found in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the L1-L2</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L6-S1</ENAMEX> segments of
          the spinal cord as a function of incubation time. The
          table and figures demonstrate the following points:
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) There were many more neurons labeled by the virus
          from the bladder than by the virus from the prostate.
          Virus from the bladder labeled a mean total of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3629</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neurons</ENAMEX>. The majority of these (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3507</TIMEX>) were found in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L6-S1</ENAMEX>. Virus from the prostate labeled a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">368</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neurons</ENAMEX>. The majority of these (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">294</ENAMEX>) were found in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L1-L2</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) There were few double-labeled neurons (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">57</NUMEX>). They
          were found after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2.75 days</TIMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L1-L2</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L6-S1</ENAMEX> with the
          majority in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L6-S1</TIMEX>. They were located in the dorsal gray
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">commissure</ENAMEX> (DGC) and the intermediolateral area (IML)
          with the majority in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DGC</ENAMEX>. The doubles were exclusively
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interneurons</ENAMEX>. No preganglionic neurons were doubles.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) Neurons located in the superficial dorsal horn
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">475</ENAMEX>) were only labeled from injections into the bladder
          and were only found in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L6-S1</TIMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5A</NUMEX>) and only after
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2.75 days</TIMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) With increasing incubation time more neurons of all
          types were labeled (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1and Figures 3and 4</ENAMEX>). These
          increases occurred mainly through the labeling of larger
          numbers of interneurons. For example, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L1-L2</TIMEX> the number
          of interneurons (prostate + bladder) at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2.25 days</TIMEX> was
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.67</NUMEX>. The number of interneurons at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 days</TIMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">172.25</NUMEX>, an
          increase by a factor of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 60</NUMEX>. These are to be
          compared to the numbers of preganglionic cholinergic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neurons</ENAMEX> (prostate + bladder) of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14.33</NUMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2.25 days</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">74</NUMEX>
          at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 days</TIMEX>, an increase by a factor of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 5</NUMEX>. The mean
          total number of interneurons was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">263</NUMEX> compared to the mean
          number of all labeled neurons of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">439</NUMEX>.
          The corresponding numbers in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L6-S1</TIMEX> were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17.17</NUMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.25</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days, 1623</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 days</TIMEX> for the interneurons and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.17</NUMEX> at
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2.25 days</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">71.75</NUMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 days</TIMEX> for the preganglionic
          cholinergic neurons. The mean total number of
          interneurons was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2939</TIMEX> compared to a total number of
          labeled neurons of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3574</TIMEX>.
          Double-labeled neurons were found in the cord in the
          dorsal gray commissure and intermediolateral regions
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DGC</ENAMEX>>IML). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Preganglionic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neurons</ENAMEX> labeled by virus from
          the prostate were only found in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the L1-L2</TIMEX> cord and were
          divided between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DGC</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IML</ENAMEX> with the larger
          fraction in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DGC</ENAMEX>. No preganglionic neurons innervating
          the prostate were found in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L6-S1</TIMEX>. Preganglionic neurons
          labeled by virus from the bladder were mainly found in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L6-S1</ENAMEX> cord and mainly IML. Some were located in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L1-L2</TIMEX>
          in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DGC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IML</ENAMEX> areas (IML>DGC).
          Figure 5displays maps showing the locations of labeled
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neurons</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> sections from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the L6-S1</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5A</NUMEX>)

          infection. Virus-labeled bladder neurons (red) were
          mainly located in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the L6-S1</TIMEX> whereas virus-labeled
          prostate neurons (green) were mainly located in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L1-L2</TIMEX>.
          Also shown are non virus-labeled cholinergic neurons
          (blue) located mainly in the ventral horn and the
          intermediolateral areas.
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6displays</NUMEX> photomicrographs of virus-labeled and
          cholinergic neurons from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the L6-S1</TIMEX> spinal cord in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IML</ENAMEX> (A:
          virus-labeled, B: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ChAT</ENAMEX>-labeled). Several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neurons</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">(a</ENAMEX>, b,
          c) were both <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">virus</ENAMEX>-labeled and cholinergic.
        
        
          Brain
          In the brain labeled virus neurons <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> appeared <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">four</TIMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> post-infection. Labeled neurons were found in the
          raphe nuclei, gigantocellular reticular nucleus, A5
          adrenergic nucleus, locus coeruleus, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sub coeruleus</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barrington</ENAMEX>'s nucleus, periaquaductal gray, red nucleus,
          paraventricular nucleus, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral thalamus</ENAMEX>, and medial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">preoptic</ENAMEX> area. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Approximately</NUMEX> equal numbers of bladder and
          prostate neurons were found in all locations except for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barrington</ENAMEX>'s nucleus and the medial preoptic area. The
          later <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> regions contained mainly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">neurons</ENAMEX> labeled by
          virus from the bladder and only a few labeled by virus
          from the prostate. Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7displays</NUMEX> examples of
          virus-labeled bladder and prostate neurons from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> of
          these areas. Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neurons</ENAMEX> labeled from the bladder or
          prostate were found in the raphe nuclei, the A5
          adrenergic nucleus, the locus coeruleus and the
          paraventricular nucleus. In each of these areas there
          were examples of doubly labeled neurons. In the red
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">nucleus</ENAMEX> (not shown) mainly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">neurons</ENAMEX> labeled by virus from
          the bladder were observed with only a few labeled by
          virus from the prostate.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        The use of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> immunohistochemically distinguishable
        viruses allows <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to detect central nervous system
        neurons, within a single tissue section, that were labeled
        by both viruses and therefore to examine the possibility of
        interactions between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> organs that have been
        injected.
        One consideration that must be addressed concerns the
        rates of infection along the routes traveled by the two
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">viruses</ENAMEX> used in these experiments. Although precise
        experiments designed to address this question have not been
        published, preliminary results in our laboratory
        demonstrate that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> viruses infect the same neurons at
        about the same rate. Therefore, until more precise data is
        available, we shall assume that these rates are the same
        and that therefore numbers of neurons in a particular
        location infected by the viruses can be compared.
        A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> question concerns whether both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">viruses</ENAMEX> can
        simultaneously infect a single neuron. This point has not
        been directly addressed in specific experiments, but
        previously published works ( [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 10</ENAMEX> ] ) have demonstrated
        examples of double labeled neurons in brain and spinal
        cord. We shall therefore assume that there is some proof
        that responds to this point.
        In general neurons that are associated with the prostate
        or the bladder were found in those areas (intermediolateral
        and dorsal gray commissure) known to be associated with
        autonomic function.
        The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> neurons to be labeled from either the bladder
        or the prostate were located in the major pelvic ganglion.
        There were no pelvic ganglion neurons infected by both
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">viruses</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Seventy seven</TIMEX> percent of those that were
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with the prostate were also adrenergic as would
        be expected since the prostate is under sympathetic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX>. This compares to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">68%</NUMEX> reported by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Keast</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] in
        her study of fluorogold-labeled <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat prostate neurons</ENAMEX>. The
        remaining <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">22%</NUMEX> could also receive their innervation from the
        hypogastric nerve but, in addition, could be cholinergic
        thus representing a sympathetic-cholinergic pathway that
        might be related to the production of prostatic fluid [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ]
        . However there is evidence for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholinergic fibers</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ]
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">muscarinic receptors</ENAMEX> on the epithelial tissue
        surrounding the alveolar lumens [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] supporting this
        concept.
        The main finding in this experiment is that the CNS
        distribution of bladder is different from the prostate. In
        the spinal cord <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the L1-L2</TIMEX> segments cells were mainly
        labeled by virus from the prostate. As shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>,
        there were few prostate preganglionic neurons located in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L6-S1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">segments</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">any time</TIMEX> points. This is
        understandable since the prostate is mainly under
        sympathetic control. The report by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Keast</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] of prostate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neurons</ENAMEX> in the major pelvic ganglion contacted by fibers
        running in the pelvic nerve suggests, though only
        indirectly, that these come from preganglionic neurons in
        the intermediolateral region of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L6-S1</ENAMEX> spinal cord and
        that therefore more such neurons labeled by the virus
        injected into the prostate should have been found. We do
        not have an explanation of why we did not see more prostate
        preganglionic neurons in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">L6-S1</TIMEX>. However, a recent report [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> ] , demonstrated the existence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">afferent fibers</ENAMEX> that
        contacted the postganglionic neurons in the major pelvic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ganglion</ENAMEX>. Therefore there is evidence that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> other
        than those from sacral preganglionic neurons contact these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neurons</ENAMEX> and additional investigation is needed to
        completely resolve the question.
        The bladder receives its major innervation from the
        L6-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">S1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segments</ENAMEX> and that is where most of the preganglionic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neurons</ENAMEX> labeled by virus from the bladder were found. There
        were only a relatively small number of double-labeled
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interneurons</ENAMEX>. The majority of these were found in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the L6-S1</TIMEX>
        segments. In the brain, all areas examined except for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two</TIMEX>
        contained cells labeled by the bladder virus or the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">prostate virus</ENAMEX> and there were always a few that were
        labeled by both viruses. There was no area that was
        specifically labeled by the virus that was injected into
        the prostate. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barrington</ENAMEX>'s nucleus contained mainly cells
        infected by bladder virus. These neurons directly innervate
        the preganglionic neurons in the sacral parasympathetic
        nucleus that supply the excitatory impulses to the bladder
        and are among the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> neurons in the brain to be labeled
        from the spinal cord. Our present findings do not agree
        with previous published results [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15</NUMEX> ] which demonstrate
        labeling of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barrington</ENAMEX>'s nucleus by virus from the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">prostate</ENAMEX>. In those studies the virus used was the Bartha
        strain of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pseudorabies</ENAMEX> virus that is more virulent than the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">viruses</ENAMEX> used in the current work [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . It is possible
        that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bartha</ENAMEX> strain results in a much more extensive
        labeling of central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> and demonstrates that, if a
        long enough time elapses from the initial infection to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> of observation, many brain <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> will be labeled.
        For example pseudorabies virus injected into the trachea [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> ] labeled neurons in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barrington</ENAMEX>'s nucleus after an
        incubation time of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six to seven days</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pseudorabies</ENAMEX> virus
        injected into the pancreas [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] labeled neurons in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barrington</ENAMEX>'s nucleus after an incubation time of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six days</TIMEX>.
        This demonstrates the importance of following the spread of
        virus as a function of time carefully to find those areas
        that are labeled <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> area that did not
        receive any virus from the prostate is the medial preoptic
        area. This area is directly and reciprocally connected to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Barrington</ENAMEX>'s nucleus (i.e. the pontine micturition <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>)
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] and will therefore have neurons that are infected
        with the bladder virus but not with the prostate virus.
      
      
        Conclusions
        Unlike the distributions observed for bladder and
        external urethral sphincter [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] where there was
        considerable overlap as well as a large number of
        double-labeled neurons, the results for bladder and
        prostate in this work are quite different. There is very
        little overlap of the two distributions and very few
        double-labeled neurons. This result implies that there is
        little mutual interactive control of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> pelvic
        visceral organs and their functions are clearly separate
        and independent.
      
      
        Materials and Methods
        
          Surgery
          All procedures involving <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> were performed in
          compliance with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USDA Animal Welfare</ENAMEX> Act and
          amendments thereto and the revised <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Guide for the Care</ENAMEX> and
          Use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Laboratory Animals DHEW</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIH</ENAMEX>) and were approved by
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Animal Studies Subcommittee</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bay-Pine Veterans</ENAMEX>
          Administration <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medical Center</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Animals</ENAMEX> used in these
          experiments were male Sprague-Dawley <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">260-300 gm</ENAMEX>).
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> was anesthetized with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Halothane</ENAMEX> initially at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4%</NUMEX>
          in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">O</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> + <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CO</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> in a plastic box and, when the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> had succumbed, via a plastic nose cone at a
          maintenance level of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.5%</NUMEX>. An abdominal incision was made
          to expose both the urinary bladder and the prostate.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pseudorabies</ENAMEX> double labeling procedure
          The unique design of these experiments is the use of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> immunohistochemically distinguishable pseudorabies
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">viruses</ENAMEX>. This enables the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigator</ENAMEX> to examine the
          neuronal distribution of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> possibly functionally
          related organs within a single spinal cord section and to
          suggest putative interactions between them. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          pseudorabies viruses used in these experiments were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRV-Bartha Blu</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PRV-152</ENAMEX> and were donated by Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L.W.</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enquist</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRV-Bartha Blu</ENAMEX> (Ba-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Blu</ENAMEX>) is a modified Bartha
          virus that contains a gene expressing Î²-galactosidase and
          can be detected with an appropriate antiserum. PRV-152
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRV-GFP</ENAMEX>) is a <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Bartha</ENAMEX> virus modified to contain the green
          fluorescent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (GFP) and can be visualized with the
          appropriate excitation wavelength or with a polyclonal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antiserum</ENAMEX> against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX>. Each virus had a titer of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 10</NUMEX>
          8plaque-forming <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> per ml. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRV-GFP</ENAMEX> virus was
          injected into the ventral wall of the urinary bladder
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">detrusor</ENAMEX> and the Ba-Blu virus was injected into the
          ventral lobes of the prostate. In some experiments the
          order of viruses was reversed with Ba-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blu</ENAMEX> injected into
          the urinary bladder and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRV-GFP</ENAMEX> injected into the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">prostate</ENAMEX>. Results were not dependent upon which virus was
          injected into the organ. Injections were made with a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.3</NUMEX>
          ml <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">insulin</ENAMEX> syringe with a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX>-gauge tapered needle
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Becton-Dickinson Co.</ENAMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> injections of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 Î</NUMEX>¼l each were
          made into each organ under visual control with the
          operating microscope. In order to avoid the possibility
          of spread of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">virus</ENAMEX> between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> organs, the injection
          to the bladder was confined to the bladder <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> and was
          not near the prostate. The injections were observed to be
          confined to the tissue injected. To further reduce the
          possibility of spread to nearby tissues other than those
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">injected</ENAMEX>, the areas were washed with saline and the
          liquid blotted after each injection. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> each
          comprising <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> were infected and
          allowed to survive for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.25</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.75</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 and 4 days</TIMEX> post
          infection. One animal in each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> had the viruses
          reversed. At the end of these periods <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> were
          anesthetized with pentobarbital (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">80 mg/kg i.p.</ENAMEX>) and
          perfused transcardially with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> ml of cold <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krebs</ENAMEX> ringer
          followed with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> ml of cold <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4%</NUMEX> paraformaldehyde in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphate</ENAMEX> buffer (pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.4</NUMEX>). Major pelvic ganglia, spinal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cord</ENAMEX> and brain were removed and stored in cold fixative
          until ready for sectioning. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twenty-four</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> prior to
          sectioning, the tissue was exposed to a solution of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphate</ENAMEX> buffer containing <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> sucrose.
        
        
          Immunohistochemical processing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cryostat</ENAMEX> sections (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">14 microns</NUMEX>) from the major pelvic
          ganglia were cut and thaw-mounted on gelatinized slides.
          Major pelvic ganglia <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX> from experiments where the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">prostate</ENAMEX> was infected with the Ba-Blu <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">virus</ENAMEX> were
          processed with antiserum against <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Î²-galactosidase</NUMEX> (see
          below) and also with an antiserum against tyrosine
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hydroxylase</ENAMEX> to identify those neurons that were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adrenergic</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cryostat</ENAMEX> sections (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">20 microns</NUMEX>) from spinal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cord</ENAMEX> and brain were cut and stored in phosphate buffer.
          Spinal cord sections were collected sequentially in
          individual bins each containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> sections. The brain
          was cut in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> and both portions mounted on a block.
          Brain sections were collected sequentially in individual
          bins each containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> cuts each consisting of one
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">section</ENAMEX> from each brain portion. Slides were prepared
          containing a complete series of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX> representing
          either the spinal cord segments or the brain. In the case
          of the spinal cord one section of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> in each bin was
          mounted. In the case of the brain, one section from each
          pair was mounted thus representing a complete profile of
          the brain. The slides were processed
          immunohistochemically with antisera against
          Î²-galactosidase (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prime â†’ 3 Prime, Inc.</ENAMEX>) to visualize
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neurons</ENAMEX> labeled by Ba-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Blu</ENAMEX> and choline acetyl transferase
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ChAT, Chemicon, Inc.</ENAMEX>) to visualize cholinergic neurons.
          Free floating sections were incubated in a combination of
          rabbit anti Î²-galactosidase at a dilution of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1/1</NUMEX> k and
          goat <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti ChAT</ENAMEX> at a dilution of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1/100</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">overnight</TIMEX> at 4Â°C
          followed by a combination of donkey anti rabbit tagged
          with tetramethyl rhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC) and
          donkey anti goat tagged with aminomethylcoumarin acetate
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMCA</ENAMEX>) each at a dilution of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1/50</NUMEX>, at room temperature
          for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">60 minutes</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX> were mounted on gelatinized
          slides and coverslipped. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Neurons</ENAMEX> labeled with
          Î²-galactosidase appeared red under epifluorescent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">illumination</ENAMEX>. If they were also cholinergic they appeared
          blue under epifluorescent illumination. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Neurons</ENAMEX> labeled
          by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PRV-GFP</ENAMEX> were detectable because they were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">autofluorescent</ENAMEX>. Neurons were divided into three
          categories: Ba-Blu positive, PRV-GFP positive, or both
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ba-Blu</ENAMEX> and PRV-GFP positive. Neurons that were
          cholinergic were also noted. All these types of neuron
          could be detected within <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a single</NUMEX> section using
          epifluorescent illumination with appropriate filters.
          Counts of each type of neuron were made from each section
          of a complete spinal cord series. The counts were
          combined for all the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> in each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, averaged and
          a standard error computed. Maps showing the location and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> of the different types of labeled neurons were
          made with the MDPLOT software (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minnesota</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Datametrics</ENAMEX>).
          Photomicrographs were made of interesting portions of the
          sections to illustrate particular results and processed
          using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adobe</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Photoshop</ENAMEX> software (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adobe Systems Inc</ENAMEX>).
