        Mutations in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MYOC</ENAMEX> have been shown to be causative
        for primary open angle glaucoma (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">POAG</ENAMEX>) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3</NUMEX> ] .
        Glucocorticoids have been implicated in ocular hypertension
        and glaucoma due to increased plasma cortisol levels [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5</NUMEX>
        ] and altered cortisol metabolism [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7</NUMEX> ] in POAG patients
        and from the increased risk of developing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">POAG</ENAMEX> in
        steroid-responsive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Myocilin</ENAMEX> has been
        shown to be upregulated in glucocorticoid-treated human
        trabecular meshwork (TM) cells [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11</NUMEX> ] , and there is
        variable evidence for increased 
        MYOC expression in glaucomatous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13 14</NUMEX> ] . In addition, glaucoma patients
        have a higher chance of responding to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroids</ENAMEX> than
        non-glaucomatous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>. However, an extensive study
        of mutations in the proximal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> and coding region of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MYOC</ENAMEX> found no sequence polymorphisms
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroid responsiveness</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Myocilin</ENAMEX> has been shown to be secreted both in human TM
        cell cultures and in vivo in aqueous humor (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AH</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] .
        Glaucomatous mutations, however, alter myocilin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Triton</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">solubility</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] and prevent myocilin from being secreted
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . The glycosylation status of myocilin is somewhat
        controversial. Several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> have shown that myocilin is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">glycosylated</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 16 17 18 19 20 21</NUMEX> ] whereas <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> group
        suggests that myocilin is not glycosylated [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . In our
        hands, both an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-linked glycosylated <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">(≈57-kDa</NUMEX>) and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">unglycosylated (≈55-kDa</ENAMEX>) form of myocilin is detected in TM
        cell culture media [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] and aqueous humor [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . The
        basis for both secretion and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-linked glycosylation of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">myocilin</ENAMEX> is part of the focus of this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>.
        Rabbits have been successfully used as a model of
        glucocorticoid-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ocular hypertension</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 24 25 26 27</NUMEX>
        ] . In order to study the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MYOC</ENAMEX> gene expression with
        steroid-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ocular hypertension</ENAMEX>, it will be helpful to
        know the sequence of rabbit myocilin. We report here the
        cloning, sequence comparison and expression analysis of
        rabbit 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MYOC</ENAMEX> . We show that an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> peptide is necessary for myocilin secretion and we
        identify the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-linked glycosylation site found in human but
        not rabbit myocilin.
      
      
        Results
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Characterization of Rabbit MYOC</ENAMEX>
          We have cloned a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2-kb</NUMEX> cDNA for rabbit 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MYOC</ENAMEX> that encodes a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">490</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55</NUMEX>-kDa <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> with a calculated pI of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5.25</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
          Rabbit myocilin amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid sequence</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">84%</NUMEX> identical to
          human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">myocilin</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] and highly homologous across
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">species</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>) with an overall <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">64%</NUMEX> homology. Rabbit
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">myocilin</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> shorter at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-terminus</ENAMEX> than
          human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">myocilin</ENAMEX> and the same length as <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkey</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] ,
          mouse [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29 30</NUMEX> ] , and bovine [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">myocilin</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). As
          in all myocilin orthologs cloned to date, rabbit myocilin
          contains a leucine zipper motif (aa <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">103 to 152</NUMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
          A potential peroxisomal targeting signal is encoded on
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C-terminus</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SKI</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">aa 488-490</ENAMEX>). Unlike human, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkey</ENAMEX>
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse myoclin</ENAMEX>, rabbit myocilin does not contain a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">consensus N</ENAMEX>-linked glycosylation site (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-X-S/T</ENAMEX>; human, aa
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">57-59</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkey</ENAMEX>, aa <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43-45</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX>, aa <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43-45</NUMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). The
          nucleotide sequence for rabbit 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MYOC</ENAMEX> reported in this manuscript
          has been submitted to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">GenBank</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">AY191317</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Secretion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rabbit MYOC</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rabbit</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkey</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> and bovine myocilin open reading
          frames begin at amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> 15 relative to human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">myocilin</ENAMEX>.
          The function, if any, of the extra <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> aa
          encoded by human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">myocilin</ENAMEX> is not presently known. Rat
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">myocilin</ENAMEX> also contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an extra 13</NUMEX> aa <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal sequence
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] . To determine if rabbit myocilin is secreted
          despite the absence of the additional human-like
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> aa, we examined rabbit aqueous humor. We
          were able to detect myocilin in rabbit aqueous humor
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3A). This suggests that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human N</ENAMEX>-terminal <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> aa
          is dispensible for secretion and that the rabbit myocilin
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX> is sufficient to direct secretion.
          Next we created a human myocilin expression construct
          where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14aa</TIMEX> were deleted
          (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pcDNA3</TIMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hMYOC</ENAMEX>.ΔN14) forcing translation to begin at the
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> methionine codon (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). GTM66 cells were chosen
          for this study based on their ability to grow and
          transfect well and are a glaucomatous TM cell line
          derived from a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">92-year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">female donor</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 17</NUMEX> ] .
          Transfection of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">GTM66</NUMEX> cells with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal deletion
          mutant resulted in a distribution pattern similar to
          wild-type human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">myocilin</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3B). The fact that we see
          no discernable difference in the relative mobility
          between transfected human wild-type myocilin and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> amino
          acid amino-terminal deleted myocilin (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3B) and human
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">vs. monkey myocilin</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AH</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3A) may be due to the use
          of small format gels or possibly to the usage of the
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal methionine by the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> for synthesizing
          human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">myocilin</ENAMEX>, making human and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkey</ENAMEX> molecular weights
          comparable.
          Nonetheless, an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal signal peptide is likely
          necessary for directing synthesis of myocilin, via the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER-Golgi pathway</ENAMEX>, for secretion outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>. To
          determine what actually constitutes the signal sequence
          for myocilin, we conducted an analysis of signal peptide
          cleavage sites using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center for Biological Sequence</ENAMEX>
          Analysis <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SignalP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">v1.1 Database</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cbs</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dtu</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">dk/services/SignalP/.</ENAMEX> A signal peptide
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cleavage</ENAMEX> site was predicted to exist between rabbit aa <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>
          and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> (human aa <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32 and 33</TIMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] . We directly tested
          the importance of the signal peptide in myocilin
          secretion by replacing the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">32 aa</NUMEX> of human myocilin
          with a single methionine (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pcDNA3</TIMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hMYOC</ENAMEX>.ΔN32).
          Transfection of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">GTM66</NUMEX> cells with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pcDNA3</TIMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hMYOC</ENAMEX>.ΔN32
          resulted in intracellular but not extracellular myocilin
          distribution (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3B). This is the result expected if
          the signal peptide were necessary for secretion. This
          suggests that <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the first 18 aa</TIMEX> of rabbit myocilin may
          function as a signal peptide and are necessary for
          myocilin secretion.
        
        
          Myocilin Glycosylation
          Human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">myocilin</ENAMEX> has been shown to migrate as a
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55/57</NUMEX>-kDa doublet by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX>-PAGE/immunoblot analysis [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 16 17</NUMEX> ] . The modification accounting for this
          molecular weight difference is hypothesized to be due to
          differential glycosylation. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-linked glycosylation sites
          were predicted using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center for Biological Sequence</ENAMEX>
          Analysis <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NetNGlyc 1.0 Prediction Server</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cbs</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dtu</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">dk/services/NetNGlyc/.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Human</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkey</ENAMEX>
          and mouse myocilin contain a consensus asparagine
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>)-linked glycosylation site (NES) near the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-terminus</ENAMEX>,
          whereas rabbit, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> and bovine code for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SES</ENAMEX> at this
          position (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). Having a serine present at this
          position would eliminate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-linked glycosylation and would
          be predicted to result in a difference in relative gel
          mobility between human/<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkey</ENAMEX> and rabbit myocilin.
          To test this hypothesis we analyzed human, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkey</ENAMEX>, and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">rabbit AH</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">myocilin</ENAMEX> side-by-side in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX>-PAGE/immunoblots.
          The anti-human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">myocilin antibody 129</ENAMEX> used in these
          studies (generated to human amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">156-171</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 17</NUMEX> ]
          ) cross-reacts with rabbit and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkey myocilin</ENAMEX>. With
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkey</ENAMEX> myocilin we see a clear doublet, whereas
          rabbit myocilin migrates as a single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">band</ENAMEX> with the same
          relative mobility as the lower <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> of human and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkey</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">myocilin</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3A), suggesting that the asparagine vs.
          serine amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> difference is responsible for the
          differential glycosylation.
          To directly test this theory, we mutated human
          myocilin amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">57</TIMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asn</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ser</ENAMEX>, as found in
          rabbit myocilin. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Media</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> lysate from transfected
          GTM66 cells contained a single immunoreactive myocilin
          band that migrated with the same relative mobility as the
          lower wt myocilin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3B). This suggests that the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55/57</NUMEX>-kDa human myocilin doublet is due to differential
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">glycosylation</ENAMEX> and that the site of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-linked glycosylation
          on human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">myocilin</ENAMEX> is Asn 57.
          To determine the effects of deglycosylation on
          myocilin, we treated human, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkey</ENAMEX>, and rabbit <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AH</ENAMEX> with a
          cocktail of glycosidases (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>- and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX>-linked). Our results
          show that the upper <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> of human and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkey myocilin</ENAMEX> is
          eliminated whereas the lower <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> remains unaltered (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          3A). This indicates that the upper human and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkey</ENAMEX>
          myocilin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> is glycosylated. In addition, the single
          rabbit myocilin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> shifted downward slightly with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">deglycosylation</ENAMEX>. This may be due to removal of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX>-linked
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">glycosylation</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        We report the cloning and characterization of rabbit
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">myocilin</ENAMEX>. Rabbit myocilin is highly similar to the other
        myocilin orthologs (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>) and contains a leucine zipper
        motif encoded by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">exon 1</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). This conservation likely
        reflects the importance of the leucine zipper motif in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">directing protein-protein interactions</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34 35</NUMEX> ] . Many
        amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid mutations encoded</ENAMEX> in the olfactomedin homology
        domain of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">exon 3</ENAMEX> that are known to cause glaucoma in humans
        are also conserved in rabbit myocilin. In fact, all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX>
        amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">missense</ENAMEX>/nonsense mutations total) for
        human myocilin documented in the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Human Gene Mutation</ENAMEX>
        Database
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://uwcmml1s.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">uwcm</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ac</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">uk/uwcm/mg/search/5584221.</ENAMEX>htmlto
        cause glaucoma are conserved in rabbit myocilin (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fig</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Myocilin</ENAMEX> has been shown to be secreted 
        in vitro and 
        in vivo by several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12 20 21 34 36 37 38</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Secreted proteins</ENAMEX> typically
        contain a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16-30</NUMEX> aa signal sequence on their N-terminus
        which directs the completion of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> synthesis across
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">ER</ENAMEX> membrane. A signal peptidase cleaves the signal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX> and the trimmed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> is shuttled through the
        Golgi for secretion. We demonstrate the functionality of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal signal peptide in directing myocilin
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">secretion</ENAMEX>. Deletion of the predicted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal signal
        peptide results in loss of secretion but not intracellular
        appearance (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3B).
        There are conflicting reports on whether myocilin is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">glycosylated</ENAMEX>. Differential glycosylation of myocilin has
        been shown in this report and by others [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 20 21</NUMEX> ] to
        account for the appearance of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a 55/57</NUMEX>-kDa doublet by
        Western immunoblot analysis. In contrast, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Huang et al.</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX>
        ] report that myocilin is not glycosylated. This
        discrepancy may be due to technical reasons. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Huang et</ENAMEX> al.
        did not resolve the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55/57</NUMEX>-kDa doublet using their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX>-PAGE
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">system</ENAMEX> and only detected a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">57</NUMEX>-kDa human myocilin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX>, so
        any deglycosylation (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PNGase</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NANase</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX>, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O-Glycosidase</ENAMEX>) occurring would be difficult to resolve. A
        positive control was not reported in their deglycosylation
        experiment, so their conclusion that myocilin is not
        glycosylated may simply be due to inactive glycosidase. The
        lack of glycosylation seen in the 
        in vitro canine pancreatic microsomal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">membrane</ENAMEX> translation experiment may again be due to poor
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55/57</NUMEX>-kDa myocilin doublet resolution or the inability of
        this artificial system to faithfully glycosylate myocilin.
        However, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Caballero et al.</ENAMEX> was able to detect
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">deglycosylation</ENAMEX> affects using similar methodology [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ]
        .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nguyen et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] identified a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">66</NUMEX>-kDa <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> as the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">glycosylated</ENAMEX> and major extracellular form of human myocilin
        and not the upper <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55/57</NUMEX>-kDa doublet. These
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> claim that the lower <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> of the unglycosylated
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55/57</NUMEX>-kDa doublet is due to cleavage of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX>
        amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> signal peptide. In our hands, we do not see a
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">66</NUMEX>-kDa <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> on our anti-myocilin Western blots, even using
        human aqueous humor as a source of myocilin. We provide
        evidence that the upper <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55/57</NUMEX>-kDa doublet is
        the glycosylated form of myocilin (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3A). Another group
        has also reported the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">66</NUMEX>-kDa <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> using an anti-myocilin
        antibody different from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nguyen et</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">al. antibody</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] .
        The reason for the appearance of this <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">66-kDa</NUMEX> is unclear,
        but may be due to cross-reaction of the primary or
        secondary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> with another <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> such as albumin,
        which has a molecular weight of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">65-kDa</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenPept</ENAMEX> accession #
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NP</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">000468</ENAMEX>). To date, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> sequence data identifying the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">66</NUMEX>-kDa <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> as myocilin has not been reported.
        Human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">myocilin Asn57</ENAMEX> is part of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-linked
        glycosylation consensus (NES) and is the only <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">myocilin</ENAMEX> predicted to be <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-glycosylated. We provide both
        site-directed mutagenesis (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3B) and deglycosylation
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3A) evidence that the upper <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55/57</NUMEX>-kDa
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkey myocilin</ENAMEX> doublet is the glycosylated form.
        The increase in mobility of rabbit myocilin with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">deglycosylation</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3A) is likely due to removal of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX>-linked glycosylation. Analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX>-linked glycosylation
        by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">NetOGlyc 2.0 Prediction Server</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cbs</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dtu</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">dk/services/NetOGlyc/</ENAMEX>identified two
        unique (rabbit <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thr93 and Thr267</TIMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> common (rabbit
        Thr66, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thr263</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ser45</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX>-linked glycosylation sites in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rabbit</ENAMEX> vs. human/<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkey myocilin</ENAMEX>. The additional <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX>-linked
        glycosylation <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> in rabbit may be responsible for the
        mobility shift seen in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the deglycosylation</TIMEX> experiment and
        the relative diffusiveness of the rabbit myocilin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX>.
        A naturally occuring <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Asn57Asp</ENAMEX> polymorphism may be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JOAG</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] which, if truly
        disease-associated, would suggest the functional importance
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-linked glycosylation. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-linked glycosylation is known
        to confer stability on many extracellular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Myocilin</ENAMEX> is similar to fibronectin (an extracellular matrix
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>) in that both a glycosylated and unglycosylated
        form is secreted from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>. The unglycosylated form of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fibronectin</ENAMEX> is more susceptible to proteolytic degradation
        than the glycosylated form [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ] . It will be interesting
        to determine why <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> forms of myocilin are secreted in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> and what functionality, if any, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-linked
        glycosylation imparts on human vs. rabbit myocilin.
        It is still unknown how myocilin functions normally and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathophysiologically</ENAMEX>. However, recent evidence suggests
        that disease-causing myocilin mutations are gain of
        function. Disease-causing myocilin mutants are less soluble
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Triton</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] and are retained by the cell [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] .
        Other studies have shown that a truncated form of myocilin
        does not get secreted [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21</NUMEX> ] and that mouse 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MYOC</ENAMEX> knockouts are without
        discernable phenotype [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ] . Furthermore, a human
        hemizygous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> containing an interstitial deletion
        of chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, which encodes 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MYOC</ENAMEX> , was without evidence of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">glaucoma</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX> ] and another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> homozygous for a
        severly truncated form of myocilin had no evidence of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">glaucoma</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> ] or other discernable phenotypes. This
        suggests that 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MYOC</ENAMEX> haploinsufficiency is not
        causative for glaucoma and that myocilin may even be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dispensable</ENAMEX> or redundant in normal human development or
        only important when ocular stress occurs.
      
      
        Conclusions
        Rabbit 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MYOC</ENAMEX> encodes a protein highly similar
        to human 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MYOC</ENAMEX> . Rabbit myocilin is secreted
        and is detected in rabbit aqueous humor. Secretion of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">myocilin</ENAMEX> is dependent on an <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> amino acid <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal signal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">peptide</ENAMEX>. Unlike human and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">monkey AH</ENAMEX> myocilin, rabbit
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">myocilin</ENAMEX> does not undergo canonical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-linked glycosylation
        due to the substitution of a serine in the analogous human
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-linked glycosylation site (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">N57</NUMEX>). Rabbits may provide an
        in vivo system for modeling some aspects of glaucoma, such
        as steroid induced <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ocular hypertension</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 24 25 26 27</NUMEX> ]
        and the gain-of-function hypothesis in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">POAG</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ] .
      
      
        Methods
        
          Cloning of rabbit MYOC
          Total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was extracted from rabbit eye and heart
          tissue (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pel Freez</ENAMEX>) using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trizol</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Invitrogen</ENAMEX>). Primers
          derived from conserved regions of human and mouse 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MYOC</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>, primers
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Exon1F/Exon1R</ENAMEX>) were used to amplify a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">250-bp</NUMEX> section of
          rabbit 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MYOC</ENAMEX> exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1, nts 184-433</ENAMEX>)
          by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> as described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' RACE (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Invitrogen</ENAMEX>)
          was used to obtain the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' cDNA ends. Essentially,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> micrograms rabbit total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was converted into first
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">strand</ENAMEX> cDNA with adapter primer and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Superscript II</ENAMEX>
          reverse transcriptase. Primary and nested <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' RACE
          primers were all designed within the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250</NUMEX>-bp region of
          rabbit 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MYOC</ENAMEX> exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> products
          were subcloned into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TOPO™ TA</ENAMEX> cloning vectors (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Invitrogen</ENAMEX>)
          and subjected to cycle sequencing (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Division of Molecular</ENAMEX>

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Texas Southwestern Medical Center</ENAMEX>).
          Due to difficulties in amplifying the rabbit 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MYOC</ENAMEX> coding region from cDNA, we
          pieced together the entire contiguous open-reading frame
          using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rabbit genomic DNA</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clontech; New Zealand White</ENAMEX>) as
          a template with a multi-step PCR/ligation process. In the
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step, exons <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 and 2</NUMEX> were amplified from genomic DNA
          with primers <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">P357F/P368R</ENAMEX> to exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P355F/P365R</ENAMEX> to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">exon 2</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Primers</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P368R</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P355F</ENAMEX> directly abut each other
          at the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">exon 1/2</NUMEX> boundary. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> amplification was performed
          in a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> ul volume with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PfuTurbo Hotstart</ENAMEX> DNA
          Polymerase system (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stratagene</ENAMEX>) and included <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.2</NUMEX> mM dNTPs,

          products were restriction digested with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BamH1</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">exon 1</ENAMEX>) or
          Not1 (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">exon 2</ENAMEX>), purified from an agarose gel by Qiaquick
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">extraction</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qiagen</ENAMEX>), and simultaneously subcloned into a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">BamH1/Not1 digested</ENAMEX> pcDNA3 (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Invitrogen</ENAMEX>) vector to create
          a directional clone of rabbit

          (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pcDNA3</TIMEX>.RbMYOCex1-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). Sequence integrity of the cloned
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> was verified by cycle sequencing and restriction

          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Exons 1-2</ENAMEX> of plasmid <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pcDNA3</TIMEX>.RbMYOCex1-2 was then
          amplified with primers <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">P357F/P370R</ENAMEX> and exon <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> was
          amplified from genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> with primers <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">P356F/P356R.</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Primers</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P370R</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P356F</ENAMEX> directly abut each other at the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">exon 2/3</NUMEX> boundary. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> was performed as above and PCR
          products digested with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BamH1</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">exons 1-2</ENAMEX>) or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Not1</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">exon 3</ENAMEX>)
          and processed/cloned as above to create a directional
          clone of rabbit 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MYOC exons 1-2</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> spliced
          together (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pcDNA3</TIMEX>.RbMYOCex1-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). Plasmid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> integrity was
          confirmed by restriction analysis and cycle

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Human</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MYOC</ENAMEX> cDNA was cloned into the
          pcDNA3 (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Invitrogen</ENAMEX>) mammalian expression vector as
          described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . Human myocilin signal sequence
          deletions were generated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX>. A <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> primer, with a

          and processing were as described above with the exception
          that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' human 
          MYOC deletion products were cloned
          into a <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">HindIII/Bsu36I digested pcDNA3.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hMYOC</ENAMEX> wild-type

          Deglycosylation of aqueous humor myocilin
          Aqueous humor from human, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkey</ENAMEX> and rabbit was
          subjected to deglycosylation with a mixture of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-linked
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX>-linked glycosidases (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PNGase</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>, sialidase,
          β-galactosidase, glucosaminidase and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O-glycosidase</ENAMEX>) using
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enzymatic CarboRelease Kit</ENAMEX> according to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturers</ENAMEX> instructions (QA-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bio</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AH</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> in buffer
          were boiled for <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 min</NUMEX> in the presence of denaturant
          followed by incubation for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> hr at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">37°C</NUMEX> with the
          glycosidase mixture. NuPAGE sample buffer (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Invitrogen</ENAMEX>)
          was added to stop the reaction, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> were heated for
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 min</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">70°C</TIMEX> and subjected to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NuPAGE</ENAMEX> electrophoresis on
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> NuPAGE gels (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Invitrogen</ENAMEX>). Samples were transferred to
