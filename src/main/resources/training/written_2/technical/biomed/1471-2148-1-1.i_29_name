        Baculoviruses are a diverse <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of insect viruses
        that are pathogenic for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX> particularly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the
        Lepidoptera, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diptera</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hymenoptera</ENAMEX>. They have large
        double-stranded, circular, supercoiled, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> genomes of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">100-180</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">kb</ENAMEX> and are characterized by the occlusion of their
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">virions</ENAMEX> in crystalline <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein matrices</ENAMEX>. There are two
        genera of baculoviruses, the nucleopolyhedroviruses (NPVs)
        in which many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">virions</ENAMEX> are occluded in large
        polyhedron-shaped occlusion bodies, and the granuloviruses
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GVs</ENAMEX>) which normally occlude <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a single nucleocapsid</NUMEX> per
        small granular occlusion <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>. A novel feature of these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">viruses</ENAMEX> is the production of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> types of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">virions</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>].
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">occlusion</ENAMEX> derived virion (ODV) type, is present in
        occlusion <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> and spreads the infection between <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX>,
        whereas the other, the budded virion (BV) type, spreads the
        infection between cells within <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX> or in cell culture.
        A major difference between these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> types of virions is
        their envelope <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. The envelope of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ODV</ENAMEX> is not well
        characterized; and although it may be composed of multiple
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX>, the mechanism by which it facilitates the
        initiation of infection of insect midgut cells is unclear
        [reviewed in [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>]]. In contrast, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BV</ENAMEX> envelopes contain an
        envelope fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> that causes the merging of the
        virion envelope and the membrane of cellular endocytic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vesicles</ENAMEX> when exposed to low pH.
        Current evidence suggests that lepidopteran
        baculoviruses may be divided into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> phylogenetic groups
        based on the envelope fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> of budded virions [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>]. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> that includes 
        Autographa
        californica multinucleocapsid nucleopolyhedrovirus
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AcMNPV</ENAMEX>) and 
        Orgyia pseudotsugata <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MNPV</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OpMNPV</ENAMEX>),
        contain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GP64</ENAMEX> in their budded virion envelopes [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4, 5</ENAMEX>].
        Homologs of 
        gp64 are also found in a genus of
        orthomyxoviruses, the thogotoviruses [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>]. Recently a
        number of complete baculovirus genome sequences have been
        described and were found to lack an open reading frame with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homology</ENAMEX> to 
        gp64 . Analysis of the genome of the 
        Lymantria dispar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MNPV</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LdMNPV</ENAMEX>),
        revealed a single orf ( 
        ld130 ) with predicted signal and
        transmembrane domains. Characterization of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">LD130</TIMEX>, indicated
        that it localizes to the membrane of infected cells, is a
        component of budded virions, and is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-glycosylated.
        Uninfected cells transiently transfected with a plasmid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">encoding</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">LD130</ENAMEX>, showed localization of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> to the
        cell membrane and low-pH mediated cell fusion suggesting
        that LD130 is the envelope fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LdMNPV</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>].
        Similar results have been reported for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the LD130</TIMEX> homolog in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SeMNPV</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>].
        Homologs of 
        ld130 are found in the genomes of all
        the sequenced 
        gp64 -minus viruses including <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">LdMNPV</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SeMNPV</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>], 
        Plutella xylostella <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GV</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PxGV</ENAMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>]
        and 
        Xestia c-nigrum <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GV</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XcGV</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>]. In
        addition, homologs of 
        ld130 are also found in 
        gp64 -containing viruses, although
        they do not appear to be capable of mediating
        low-pH-dependent membrane fusion (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pearson et al</ENAMEX>,
        unpublished). In contrast to the close relatedness of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">baculovirus</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">gp64</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">homologs</ENAMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">LD130</NUMEX> homologs are highly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">variable</ENAMEX> suggesting that 
        gp64 was recently incorporated into a
        baculovirus genome where it displaced the envelope fusion
        function of the 
        ld130 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homologs</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>].
        Database searches with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">LD130</ENAMEX> and its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homologs</ENAMEX> routinely
        identify, not only homologous baculovirus <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, but
        some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> also showed significant levels of homology
        with the predicted envelope <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> of a number of insect
        retrovirus-like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> from 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lepidoptera</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>],
        (also see genbank documentation for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AcMNPV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">orf23</ENAMEX> in the
        AcMNPV sequence [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>]). Evidence suggests that at least
        some of these retrovirus-like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> are infectious and
        have been classified as insect retroviruses [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13, 14, 15</TIMEX>]
        or errantiviruses [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>]. In this report, we provide
        evidence for an evolutionary link between this newly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">characterized</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">baculovirus envelope proteins</ENAMEX> and
        the envelope <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> predicted for a variety of insect
        retrovirus-like retrotransposons. These relationships
        suggest a possible common origin of the envelope fusion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> for these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of viruses.
      
      
        Results
        
          Database searches with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the LD130
          family
          Routine BLAST searches of the database with individual
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">LD130</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of baculovirus proteins
          revealed high levels of similarity with a set of
          predicted envelope <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> from a number of insect
          retrovirus-like retrotransposons. For example, an LD130
          homolog from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">PxGV</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PX26</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>] showed significance values
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> -10with the envelope <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">TED</ENAMEX>, a lepidopteran
          retrovirus-like retrotransposon [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>], and in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> -4to
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 -10range</TIMEX> for a number of other predicted envelope
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> from retrovirus-like retrotransposons from other
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX>, particularly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> from the genus 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> . Searches with other
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ld130</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> showed values of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> -4to 10
          -6to these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. A 
          Drosophila orf (see below) that is
          not part of a retrovirus-like element was also
          identified. These values suggested that the relatedness
          was significant and may be evidence of an exchange of
          genes encoding this important category of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>
          between insect cells and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the baculovirus and
          retrovirus <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>. To investigate this relationship
          further, we performed BLAST searches of the database with
          all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the baculovirus <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">LD130</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> and also with
          all sequences that showed alignments with E values of
          less than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> -3to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>. When sequences
          within this category were identified that were <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">over 90%</NUMEX>
          identical, only one was included. Similarly, fragments
          from within complete sequences that were identified by
          this search were not included. This resulted in a total
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> used in our analyses (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
          With <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> exception, all the non-baculovirus sequences
          showing the best scores are derived from retrovirus-like
          retrotransposons from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX> that fall in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">T3</NUMEX>- 
          gypsy group [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>]. The exception is
          a 
          Drosophila orf called cg4715 (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">orfs</ENAMEX> adjacent to cg4715 (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">two</NUMEX> upstream and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">downstream</ENAMEX>) appear to be non-homologous to retrovirus
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">orfs</ENAMEX> (data not shown) suggesting that it may either be an
          insect gene or a remnant of an integrated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">retroelement</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Significance of the relatedness of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Ld130</NUMEX> family
          The potential relationships uncovered by the BLAST
          searches were further assessed for significance by the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">calculation of Z</ENAMEX>-scores for each of the sequences
          compared to each of the other sequences (see Methods).
          This led to the grouping of the sequences into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subfamilies</ENAMEX> based on Z-score cutoff values of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">≥ 20</NUMEX> (Figs.
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1, 2</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). These include the baculovirus subfamily,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">divisions</ENAMEX> of the dipteran 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gypsy retrotransposon group</ENAMEX> with
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> each, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> subfamilies each with a
          single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX>. The latter included <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> dipteran 
          gypsy sequence, the lepidopteran 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gypsy</ENAMEX> -like element <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">TED</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>], and
          the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein cg4715</ENAMEX>.
          We then compared each subfamily using the conservative
          <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">criterion of a Z</ENAMEX>-score of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">≥ 6</ENAMEX> as an indicator of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homology</ENAMEX>.
          Furthermore, guided by the assumption that sequence
          features conserved over long evolutionary distances
          should also be conserved over short distances, a
          secondary criteria used for the more distant
          relationships was that Z-scores derived from comparing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> of sequences should show enhanced significance
          over that of the individual sequences. The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Z</ENAMEX>-scores
          revealed strong evidence for the homology of the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seventeen</NUMEX> sequences (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Members</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">LD130</NUMEX> family
          showed Z-scores of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9 and 10</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> containing
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gypsy proteins</ENAMEX>. These are similar
          to scores determined for comparisons between different
          gypsy envelope <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">from 9 to12</TIMEX>. In addition, only
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> [called rhoptry, from 
          Plasmodium yoelii (accession #
          T28677)], fell within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">our 10 -3BLAST</TIMEX> search cutoff in two
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">instances</ENAMEX> (with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T13994</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p20829</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>]). However,
          when aligned to each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> sequences, only one
          alignment resulted in a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Z</ENAMEX>-score of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> and all the other
          z-scores were <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">≤2</NUMEX>. Also when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of each subfamily
          were grouped together and compared with this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, the
          scores were not enhanced (data not shown). A matrix
          comparing the levels of sequence identities among these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> is shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, and reveals that in
          contrast to Z-scores, sequence identity is not a reliable
          indicator of evolutionary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatedness</ENAMEX> at the longer
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">distances</ENAMEX>. For example, although the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">groups</ENAMEX> composed of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#1-4</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#7-10 and #11-14</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>) are
          clearly related to one another, their relationship with
          other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the data set are unclear.
        
        
          Features of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">LD130 protein</ENAMEX> family
          In addition to the overall sequence homology, our
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">analyses</ENAMEX> revealed a number of other conserved features
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). They all are predicted to be moderately large
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">348 to 649</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> and all contain
          predicted signal peptides at their amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">terminus</ENAMEX> and
          transmembrane domains near their carboxyl terminus.
          Another feature of these sequences is the conservation
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cysteine residues</ENAMEX>. In the baculovirus sequences, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>
          cysteines are conserved (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). In <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">TED</ENAMEX>, the
          lepidopteran retrovirus-like element, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> of the
          C-terminal cysteine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> are conserved. Likewise in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> sequence, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">cg4715</TIMEX>, that is not a component
          of a retrotransposon, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal cysteines are
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conserved</ENAMEX>. With the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> other categories of retroelements
          represented by 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gypsy</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tom in Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> of the
          cysteines are conserved. The consensus pattern of
          cysteine conservation is shown at the bottom of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>.
          It has recently been reported that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SE8</TIMEX>, a homolog of
          LD130, is the likely membrane fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> for the 
          Spodoptera exigua <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MNPV</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>].
          Furthermore, by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal sequence analysis it was found
          that in budded virions, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SE8</TIMEX> was truncated downstream of a
          motif that is a furin cleavage consensus sequence in
          other viruses. This motif has the sequence <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K/RXXK</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R.</ENAMEX> One
          of the striking features of our alignments is that this
          site and downstream <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> appear to be conserved in
          these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). The downstream sequence has the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX>-amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid motif gXΦBΦΦGXΦXKΦΦΦGXΦDXXD</ENAMEX> where Φ
          represents sites with predominantly hydrophobic amino
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">acids</ENAMEX>, B represents <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> represents any amino
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>. The lower case of the initial g is related to its
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">absense</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gypsy sequences</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#7</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
          This motif is present in all the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> except those
          represented by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ac23 and Op21</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Figs. 3, 5</ENAMEX>) and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">cg4715</TIMEX>.
          Both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AcMNPV</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">OpMNPV utilize GP64</ENAMEX> as their envelope
          fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> and neither OP21 nor AC23 appear to
          function as an envelope fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> in cell fusion
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assays</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pearson et al</ENAMEX>, unpublished). Likewise, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">cg4715</ENAMEX> is
          not a component of a virus-like element. In contrast, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX> is conserved in the other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that may play
          a role in membrane fusion. It has previously been
          suggested that for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gypsy</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">env proteins</ENAMEX> the
          protease cleavage site may be downstream of this sequence
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13, 20</TIMEX>]. A similar cleavage site location was suggested
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">TED</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>]. However, the major env components were
          never <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminally sequenced and the data could also be
          interpreted to be the result of the removal of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 12</NUMEX>
          kda from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-termini of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> at the cleavage
          site shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>.
          Coiled-coil-like motifs are a distinguishing feature
          of a number of viral fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. A program,
          Learncoil-VMF, has been developed to predict the location
          and the probability of these domains occurring within a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>]. We applied this program to the LD130
          family of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. A summary of the scores is shown in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1and</ENAMEX> the location of the coiled-coil domains is
          indicated in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>. Coiled-coil-like domains were
          predicted for many of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> immediately
          downstream of the predicted cleavage site. With <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          exceptions in which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> regions were identified (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>), the program predicted a single coiled-coil region in
          a similar location, or in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> instances, no such
          region. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPVs</ENAMEX> that lack GP64
          (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">LD130 and SE8</TIMEX>), the same location was identified.
          However, the program predicted these regions slightly
          downstream for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> granulovirus <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">XC27</ENAMEX> and
          PX26, (these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">viruses</ENAMEX> also lack gp64) placing them in
          the same position as predicted for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> from NPVs
          that contain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GP64</ENAMEX>. The baculovirus <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> had a
          probability of this motif occurring from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.23</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Op21</NUMEX>) to
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.63</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Ac23</NUMEX>). In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> set of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gypsy</ENAMEX> retrovirus-like elements
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#7-10</NUMEX>), the probability of the coiled-coil motif
          downstream of the cleavage site ranged from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.26</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.0</NUMEX>.
          The rest of the sequences showed a high degree of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variability</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> sequences (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#15 and #16</NUMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">TED</ENAMEX>]), showed a
          strong probability (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.69 and 0.54</NUMEX>, respectively) just
          upstream of the predicted cleavage site (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). No.<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>
          also showed a broad <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.17</NUMEX> probability just
          downstream of the cleavage site. With the exception of
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#12</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.44</NUMEX>), the remaining <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">three sequences</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#11,13</NUMEX>, and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX>) had a probability of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>. This included the cellular
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein cg4715</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        In this report we have investigated the evolutionary
        relatedness between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> categories of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, the
        retrovirus-like 
        gypsy envelope <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, the
        baculovirus LD130 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of envelope-associated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>,
        and an insect cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. Globally optimal sequence
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alignments</ENAMEX> in combination with assessment of the
        significance of the alignment scores resulted in striking
        patterns of relatedness. Not only did our analyses link the
        
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gypsy</ENAMEX> -derived envelope proteins
        together with a high level of significance as would be
        predicted from studies of other 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gypsy genes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>], but it also linked
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of the major categories of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gypsy sequences</ENAMEX> to the baculovirus
        ld130 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> with similar levels of significance. In
        addition, a cell-encoded <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> from 
        Drosophila showed relatedness at a
        high level of significance to the baculovirus <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ld130 protein</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX>. The parameters we used as a basis for these analyses
        were conservative with cut-off Z-score values
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 6</NUMEX> standard deviations above the
        value for the randomized sequences. In addition to the
        overall homology, a number of other features common to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of this class of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> were identified. These
        included the predicted signal sequences and transmembrane
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">domains</ENAMEX> and a striking conservation surrounding a possible
        protease cleavage site in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that likely serve as
        envelope fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>]. In addition, predicted
        coiled-coil domains in similar locations relative to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cleavage</ENAMEX> site in a number of the sequences further suggest
        both functional and structural similarities between members
        of this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>.
        Concurrent with the preparation of this research for
        publication, a similar study by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Malik et al</ENAMEX> was reported [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX>]. They also describe a relationship between the envelope
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">gypsy</ENAMEX> retrovirus-like elements and the ld130
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">baculovirus envelope proteins</ENAMEX>. They identified the
        predicted signal and transmembrane domains that we describe
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3and the conserved region that we compare in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>. Their alignments also highlight the conservation of the
        cysteine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> that we describe in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>.
        Although our analyses convincingly indicate a
        relationship between the insect cellular, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gypsy</ENAMEX> , and baculovirus membrane
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX>, we can only speculate on the evolutionary pathway
        leading to the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of this set of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>
        in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> types of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>. If homologs of the cg4715
        gene are conserved among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diptera</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lepidoptera</ENAMEX>, the
        interrelationship between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the baculoviridae and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">TED</ENAMEX>, the lepidopteran 
        gypsy element capable of integrating
        into both a host insect and a baculovirus genome, provides
        a clear pathway via DNA recombination for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">ld130</NUMEX> gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> cells,
        baculovirus genomes, and the transposable element. Indeed,
        a phylogenetic analysis of the envelope <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> of these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> reported by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Malik et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>] suggests that they
        are derived from a monophyletic event that resulted from
        their incorporation of a baculovirus envelope <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein gene</ENAMEX>
        in an ancestral <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of these retrovirus-like
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">TED</ENAMEX> has features that suggest that it may have
        specifically evolved to exploit a relationship with a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">baculovirus</ENAMEX> and this may have facilitated its acquisition
        of a baculovirus envelope <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein gene</ENAMEX>. It is present as a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mid-level</ENAMEX> repeated element in its host insect genome (about
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> copies/genome) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19, 24</TIMEX>], it encodes a set of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>
        (gag, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pol</ENAMEX>, env) with features similar to those of
        well-characterized retrovirus <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>] and it is
        capable of producing virus-like particles [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>]. A specific
        example of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">TED</ENAMEX>'s adaptation to baculovirus biology is the
        presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">palindromes</ENAMEX> containing the baculovirus late
        promoter element in its long terminal repeat [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17, 24</TIMEX>].
        Evidence suggests that this results in the high level
        transcription of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">TED</ENAMEX> genome by the viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> polymerase
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>] and could lead to the production of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">TED</ENAMEX> virus-like
        particles concomitant with the baculovirus late gene
        expression. This would provide a novel two-pronged escape
        mechanism from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX> suffering from a fatal baculovirus
        infection; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">TED</ENAMEX> might be passed to other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX> as an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">integrated</ENAMEX> transposable element in an infectious
        baculovirus, or as an infectious retrovirus. Oral
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transmission</ENAMEX> is the normal route for baculovirus infection
        and has been reported for 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gypsy</ENAMEX> retrovirus-like
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">retrotransposons</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>]. This strategy could elevate the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">retrotransposon</ENAMEX>'s potential to exchange genetic material
        with the genomes of its viral and cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hosts</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ld130</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of baculovirus envelope
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> have been demonstrated to mediate low-pH membrane
        fusion [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>]. In contrast, retroviruses normally enter cells
        by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>-mediated fusion at the cell surface (reviewed
        in [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>]) or by a combination of both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> and low-pH
        mediated events [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>]. Despite the differing mechanisms of
        cell entry, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> groups have been related
        by a number of structural criteria [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>]. The link that we
        have described in this report and that of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Malik et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>]
        suggests the possibility of a genetic relationship as
        well.
      
      
        Conclusions
        The relatedness of a class of low pH-dependent
        baculovirus envelope fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> to envelope proteins
        of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gypsy</ENAMEX> retrovirus-like elements was
        demonstrated to be highly significant. Transposon mediated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">exchange</ENAMEX> provides a documented pathway for the movement of
        this gene between insect cells, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different types of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">viruses</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Materials and Methods
        Blast searches were performed using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gap</ENAMEX>-Blast search
        engine [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>]. Sequence alignments were performed with the
        program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">SEQUOIA</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.M Bruns</ENAMEX> which is available on the web
        at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">scripps</ENAMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">edu/∼bruns/sequoia.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">html</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEQUOIA</ENAMEX> uses
        a conventional dynamic programming <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">algorithm</ENAMEX> based on the
        work of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Needleman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wunsch</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>] to find the globally
        optimal alignment given a particular residue comparison
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">matrix</ENAMEX> and gapping model. The statistical significance of
        the optimal alignment was assessed by calculation of their
        Z-score. The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Z</ENAMEX>-score is derived by comparison of an
        observed alignment score with the distribution of scores
        obtained for alignments after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the sequences was
        shuffled to create a random sequence with the same amino
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid composition</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> shuffles were carried out for each
        sequence comparison and the significance was measured
        relative to the mean and standard deviation of scores from
        the shuffled sequences. Quantitatively, the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Z</ENAMEX>-score is
        defined as the number of standard deviations of the
        observed score above the mean of the shuffled scores and is
        determined by the following equation:
        Z-score = Observed score - mean shuffled score/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Standard</ENAMEX>
        deviation of shuffled scores
        In the work we describe here, alignments were done using
        a gap penalty of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> and the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">BLOSUM62</NUMEX> scoring matrix [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX>].
        An additional important feature of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEQUOIA</ENAMEX> is that a
        "sequence" need not be just a single sequence, but can be a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">prealigned</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of sequences that are treated as a
        unit.
