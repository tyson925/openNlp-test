        Primary care <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX>, by virtue of their position and
        function in healthcare, are key to the delivery of
        preventive care [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . However, routine integration of
        primary prevention into practice has been sub-optimal,
        resulting in lost opportunities to decrease <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">morbidity</ENAMEX> and
        mortality [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . For example, though the Preventive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Services Task Force</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4</NUMEX> ] recommends that preventive
        services be a part of every medical visit, studies report a
        compliance rate of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 20% to 60%</NUMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6 7</NUMEX> ] .
        Studies of barriers to implementation of preventive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">services</ENAMEX> have concluded that a) changing physician
        practices requires altering their routine practice
        environment [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] and b) the integration of a systematic
        well-organized methodology into the primary practice
        environment is key to increasing the rate of prevention
        services delivery [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . The long-term goal of this study
        is a web-based primary care practice tool to facilitate
        physician-delivered health behavior counseling. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX> of the tool's printed output will assist the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX> in risk identification and prioritization and
        delivery of patient-tailored evidence-based health behavior
        recommendations at the time of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinic</ENAMEX> visit. Previous
        studies have shown that the introduction of appropriate
        support and tools has resulted in physician-reported
        increased self-efficacy in changing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> behavior [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> ] and increased rates of risk counseling [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13</NUMEX> ] . An
        efficient integrated practice tool could also advance
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">physicians</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> to view chronic and acute care
        visits, in addition to well care visits, as opportunities
        to deliver preventive services.
        When developing such a tool, sole reliance on past
        studies of barriers [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15 16 17 18</NUMEX> ] is not advised, as
        barriers in one setting may not be generalizable to another
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . Formative assessment is necessary to identify
        barriers, universal and indigenous, in the intended
        environment. In addition, before any intervention tool can
        be developed and introduced, its claims of benefit and
        relevancy to the intended practice environment must be
        evidence-based. Finally, whether the conceptual credibility
        of the intervention can produce behavioral change is
        largely dependent on its ability to translate to real world
        application and benefit in the context of the intended
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX>'s environment. The "sell of health" as the product has
        not been sufficient, as evidenced by the lack of routine
        preventive care delivery. To overcome attitudes and office
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX> that often emphasize treatment versus preventive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">care</ENAMEX>, the tool must be developed and "sold" on points
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">salient</ENAMEX> and compelling to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX> values, beliefs, and
        experiences [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21</NUMEX> ] . In sum, a comprehensive assessment
        of the targeted environment is essential to the process of
        intervention development and application.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PRECEDE-PROCEED</ENAMEX> model [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] , a comprehensive
        health promotion-planning model, provided the framework for
        this study's incremental progression towards intervention
        visualization, development, and adoption. Physician
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">formative</ENAMEX> involvement in the tool <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">development</ENAMEX> began with
        the convening of a focus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> peer-identified
        primary care physician <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Opinion Leaders</ENAMEX>. The aims of the
        focus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> were to a) identify conceptual themes that
        characterize primary care <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician attitudes</ENAMEX>, deterrents,
        and practice environments regarding preventive care and, on
        the basis of the findings, b) establish the conceptual
        framework of an intervention tool that will best meet the
        needs of primary care practices.

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">characteristics</ENAMEX> (e.g., age, insurance status), primary

          intent of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX> discussion. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">One week</TIMEX> following
          the mailing, the lead <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researcher</ENAMEX> called each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX>'s
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">office</ENAMEX> to answer any questions and determine physician

          views on the nature and goals of preventive medicine, use
          of primary prevention in the region, and existing tools
          to assist in the delivery of primary prevention. To avoid
          channeling the discussion, study descriptors provided to
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCP</ENAMEX> and the focus group <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">moderator</ENAMEX> never used the

          Analysis
          The focus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> audiotape was transcribed verbatim.
          Primary data analysis was based on grounded theory
          methodology [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 25</NUMEX> ] . Transcripts were analyzed
          line-by-line, coding the text with labels that
          encapsulated the substantive meaning inherent in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>' testimonies. Similar codes were clustered
          to rebuild the data into conceptual categories within the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>. Initial categories were then subsumed into more
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">encompassing</ENAMEX> categories. These broader categories were
          abstract characterizations of the data, as they accounted
          for numerous instances of a certain phenomena under one
          theoretical concept. Theoretical memos were written
          throughout the analysis, which provided a record of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">analytic</ENAMEX> process as themes were developed. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> discussed the development of the themes
          throughout the analysis, reaching consensus on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX>
          final emergent themes. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> of the themes focusing on
          perspectives of primary prevention are presented in this
          paper (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
        
      
      
        Results
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Theme 1</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX>' perspectives about primary
          prevention
          This theme emerged from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX>' perspectives about
          what constituted primary prevention and preventive
          medicine in the health care arena. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Physicians</ENAMEX> offered
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> models of prevention: a traditional model based on
          their medical training, a public health model, and a
          contemporary wellness model.
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> model, a traditional conception of
          preventive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX>, highlighted primary, secondary, and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tertiary</ENAMEX> levels of care. This "textbook" definition of
          prevention was learned in medical school and guided the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX>'s role in <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> prevention and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX>:
          "Three levels of prevention: primary, secondary and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tertiary</ENAMEX>. A<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">-M-A</ENAMEX>: 
          A void <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> odify <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, 
          A meliorate disease."
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians unanimously</ENAMEX> stated that, of the levels
          of preventive care, secondary prevention was most
          stressed in their medical training. Their training
          focused on the diagnosis and treatment of presenting
          conditions, which tangentially de-prioritized primary
          prevention in clinical care:
          "We were trained to use intervention rather that
          prevention."
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> model offered a population-level approach
          to primary prevention. This public or community health
          model was based on early epidemiological advances, such
          as the prevention of infectious diseases through
          government sanitation and vaccination efforts. The main
          implication of the public health model was that
          governmental public health <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agencies</ENAMEX>, not clinical
          practices, were the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> responsible for delivery of
          primary prevention. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Participants</ENAMEX> also noted that
          community level prevention could be particularly
          difficult to achieve in certain <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> due to
          socioeconomic factors, such as age, ethnicity, income,
          and existing level of disease burden. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Physicians</ENAMEX> felt
          relatively unprepared to deal with underlying factors
          affecting primary prevention that they perceived to be
          outside their realm of control.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Physicians</ENAMEX> noted the importance of the contemporary
          model of wellness that went beyond traditional notions of
          medical care or public health. Wellness, not simply a
          matter of being disease-free, was characterized as a
          state of high functioning that integrated mind, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX>, and
          spirit. Primary prevention, though an important factor of
          wellness, was only one component in a more abstract
          conception of good health:
          "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wellness</ENAMEX> is the goal of prevention, essentially, and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">wellness</ENAMEX> is not just the absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, it's the
          presence of satisfaction with one's mental and physical
          well being at the same time. So wellness is an outgrowth
          of prevention."
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">As much as</NUMEX> wellness was an ideal health status,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> believed that wellness was a difficult and
          complex status to achieve:
          "...we throw that terminology out a lot, but it's
          really quite complicated to keep <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> healthy....for
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX>, for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>, for the society as a
          whole."
          Wellness was expressed as a broad concept that went
          beyond most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX>' medical school training and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">education</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Theme 2</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCP</ENAMEX> view of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>' perspectives of
          preventive care
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> sought care with an existing frame of mind
          that dictated their expectations of the office visit.
          According to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCPs</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> typically entered
          examination <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">rooms</ENAMEX> seeking treatment for acute or chronic
          conditions; few specifically sought primary preventive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">care</ENAMEX>. The relatively small number of proactive requests
          for preventive care was often limited to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
          memberships in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HMO</ENAMEX>'s that promoted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">wellness</ENAMEX> visits.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> reported the lay media (i.e.,
          television, advertisement, print, Internet) to be a
          significant influencer of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>' perspectives and
          mindsets about their health care needs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> were
          increasingly informed and predisposed by consumer-direct
          marketing and popular ideas about health, which often
          lead to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX>-skewed perceptions of health
          needs and goals:
          "...Yes, it's a very vogue, in thing right now...to
          get the total <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> CT scan. It only costs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundred</NUMEX>
          dollars and they're doing it in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>, and so that
          sets a thought process in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s mind that 'Well, if
          I do this and everything is okay, I must be well', and
          that's completely off base."
          Health information retrieved through the lay <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> had
          also produced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>' risk perceptions that were at
          times in conflict with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>' best medical
          interests. For example, one <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX> noted the
          following:
          "You have <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who come in who have a cholesterol
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">350</NUMEX>, and they are more concerned that they are going
          to have a liver side effect if they take a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX> ...
          than their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">350</NUMEX>. And so media plays a huge
          role in what <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s perception of what is important to
          them."
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> observed that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> had enhanced
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>' expectation of a "silver bullet" cure. Some
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> not willing to commence exercise or stop smoking
          were willing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">users</ENAMEX> of nutritional supplements, despite
          the convincing evidence of benefit for the former and
          less evidence for the latter. A perceived quick fix, such
          as a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pill</ENAMEX>, avoided the more difficult issue of behavior
          change, and justified <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>' satisfaction or
          complacency with their non-healthy behaviors.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Physicians</ENAMEX> stated that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who were satisfied
          with their current level of health did not feel the need
          to change their behaviors because they were healthy for
          the moment. "Ignorant bliss" was a frequent basis for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>' lack of interest in changing behaviors
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with an increased risk of disease later in
          life.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Physicians</ENAMEX> had to contend with the reality that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>' agendas often were in conflict with their own.
          The disparity between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>' and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX>' health
          care expectations and wants deterred the delivery of
          primary prevention.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Theme 3</ENAMEX>: focusing on behavioral change
          Throughout the discussion, behavioral change was often
          cited as a central issue for the promotion of wellness
          and primary prevention. Behavioral change was a difficult
          task for both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX>, though one that
          primary prevention and wellness were dependent upon. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCPs</ENAMEX> believed that implementing behavioral change
          required changing the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>' mindsets, including
          leading <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> to accept more personal responsibility
          for their wellness. It would be virtually impossible to
          initiate behavioral change if a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> expressed no
          interest or willingness to change, regardless of methods
          employed to motivate the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> perceived that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> self-selected
          for behavioral change. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> who were willing to
          change would change. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> resistant to change would
          not. Perception of patient behavior as a dichotomy of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">compliant</ENAMEX> versus not compliant, however, seemed to thwart
          physician consideration of more subtle issues related to
          health behaviors and behavioral change.
          It was reported that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>' receptivity to health
          promotion discussion was dynamic, and times of openness
          were opportunities to be capitalized upon. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Physicians</ENAMEX>
          needed to take advantage of a willing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>, though
          willingness to change was characterized as random - "you
          never know which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> is going to listen".
          Other significant barriers to behavioral change were
          attributed to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> themselves. They acknowledged
          their lack of training, knowledge, and skill in
          behavioral change process and recommendation conveyance.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Participants</ENAMEX> expressed a desire for tools that could help
          with patient behavioral change, but often had to create
          approaches of their own:
          "I don't think that we were trained when we were in
          medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">school</ENAMEX>, in residency, at least I was not, in
          effective ways of changing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> behavior. We were not
          trained in that. You learn it by successes and
          failures."
          Physician acceptance of the concept and worth of
          promoting health behaviors was ideal, but there were
          considerable barriers to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX> delivery,
          recommendation, and the follow-up of these behaviors with
          their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Significant emergent concepts
          In addition to the themes, several significant
          concepts emerged from the focus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. In the forefront
          was the observation that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> do not perceive the
          purported power [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] of their recommendations in
          motivating patient behavioral change. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX>
          generally lacked a sense of behavioral capability,
          expectation, and self-efficacy [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] regarding their
          ability to successfully recommend, produce, and sustain a
          change in patient health behaviors. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Secondly</NUMEX>, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">diseases</ENAMEX> emphasized by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> were non-malignant
          chronic conditions, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart disease</ENAMEX>,
          which reflected the conditions typically managed on a
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> basis. <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Cancer</ENAMEX> was mentioned only briefly. Thirdly,
          the underscored health risk behaviors were <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tobacco</ENAMEX> use,
          weight control, dietary intake, and exercise. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Fourth</NUMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> was the essential element for tuning-in to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> to ensure preventive care was received, while
          simultaneously a constraint to offering care. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Physicians</ENAMEX>
          did not get reimbursed for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> counseling services
          delivered in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">less than 15 minutes</TIMEX>. Reportedly, there was
          no clear financial incentive for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> to provide
          behavioral counseling within the context of typical
          visits. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Fifth</NUMEX>, existing tools to aid the delivery of
          preventive care, particularly written educational
          materials, were seen as only partially effective.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Physicians</ENAMEX> were interested in finding truly effective
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aids</ENAMEX>:
          "We do not have unlimited time, so anything that aids
          us technologically, check lists or whatever, is something
          that's going to help us with prevention."
          Though awareness and use of existing tools and aids
          was minimal, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> felt that thoughtfully engineered
          tools would be of great assistance. The potential of such
          tools is supported by observations that suitable tools
          have lead to increased physician self-efficacy [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11</NUMEX> ]
          and rate of risk counseling [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13</NUMEX> ] .
          The study analysis, based in grounded theory, was an
          exhaustive process that maximized the data obtained from
          the session. This method suited the preliminary aims of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">formative PCP</ENAMEX> involvement and the identification of
          conceptual themes to begin the characterization of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCP</ENAMEX>
          perceptions regarding primary prevention. Of note, the
          emergent concepts concurred with many of those observed
          in larger studies [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] and reports, such as that done
          by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center for the Advancement of Health</ENAMEX> (CFAH) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ]
          . The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFAH</ENAMEX> collected data nationwide from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">141</NUMEX> clinicians,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX>, program <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">directors</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organizations</ENAMEX> in an
          effort to understand impediments to routine delivery of
          preventive care. Findings of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX> and patient
          resistance to change in traditional roles, insufficient
          training and low self-efficacy in behavioral counseling,
          low patient motivation, and lack of relevant counseling
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX> corroborated those reported in this study.
          Nevertheless, the use of multiple focus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> would have
          enhanced this study's confidence in the initial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">characterization</ENAMEX> and generalizability. The identified
          concepts will be applied towards the development of a
          survey that will be mailed to a randomized sample,
          stratified by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">county</ENAMEX>, practice specialty, and physician
          gender, of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WNY PCP</ENAMEX> to test and refine the
          characterization of regional perceptions and experiences.
          The focus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> and survey findings will then be applied
          in the development of the practice tool.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        It is apparent from the focus <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> and literature [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX>
        ] that the delivery of non-reimbursed, but critical, health
        behavior counseling is dependent upon the complex
        relationship among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, practice
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">characteristics</ENAMEX>, and office systems. On the basis of the
        emergent themes and concepts, it is concluded that the
        future tool will need to meet the following criteria to
        increase the probability of the tool's perceived benefit
        and integration into primary care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">practice</ENAMEX>:
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) A tool whose design, content, and clinical saliency
        address the behavioral capability, expectation, and
        self-efficacy deficits of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX>, as these constructs
        are significant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediators</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX> behavior;
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) A tool that produces health behavior, not
        disease-specific, assessments and recommendations that
        acknowledge and emphasize the overlapping behavioral risks
        among non-malignant and malignant <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> for which a
        given <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> may be at risk; to explicate the connection
        between health behaviors and a number of presenting or
        potential illnesses;
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) A tool that presents primary prevention as a
        component of the broader concept of wellness; to increase
        the perceived relevancy or fit of primary prevention within
        typical visits that are predominantly viewed as occasions
        for secondary prevention;
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) A tool whose health behavior risk assessment and
        recommendations are tailored to each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s health
        status and attitude toward health behavior change; the tool
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">feedback</ENAMEX> could provide an avenue for change, and/or act as
        a contract between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX> and patient;
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>) A tool that assists the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX> or other health
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX> to deliver tailored health behavior
        recommendations and strategies in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1-3 minutes</TIMEX> during
        typical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinic</ENAMEX> visits;
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>) A web-based tool maintained by an outside
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX>, not the practice, that could be easily
        updated to sustain scientific accuracy and keep attuned to
        patient concerns prompted, in part, by lay media;
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>) A tool that would act as an aid, not a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">replacement</ENAMEX> or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">add-on</ENAMEX>, to the physician-patient relationship.
        If these criteria are met, the integrated practice tool
        could facilitate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> to view more
        typical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinic</ENAMEX> visits as opportunities for primary
        preventive care. Again, this view would be advanced if the
        tool more expansively framed the visit as an opportunity
        for wellness. The goal of wellness, a status determined by
        and aims tailored to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s situation and abilities,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inherently</ENAMEX> acknowledges that human behavior is not linear
        and uniform, but dynamic and variable. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Physician</ENAMEX> and
        patient success would be measured in terms of incremental
        progressive changes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] versus the absolute of success
        or failure. Risk reduction, as well as risk elimination,
        would contribute to increased perceptions of behavioral
        capability, expectation, and self-efficacy by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX>
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> alike. Outcomes of this type of success may
        help establish the worth of and, thereby, the market for
        the routine provision of primary preventive care in all
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clinic</ENAMEX> visits.
