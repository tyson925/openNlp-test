        High affinity humoral immune responses to most protein
        antigens require cognate interactions between
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">antigen</ENAMEX>-specific T and B cells. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antigen</ENAMEX>-specific T cells
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">encounter antigen</ENAMEX> presented by dendritic cells that migrate
        to the paracortical regions of draining lymph <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">nodes</ENAMEX> after
        initial antigen contact [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . Only dendritic cells have
        the capacity to induce activation in resting peripheral T
        cells [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3</NUMEX> ] . Once activated, differentiated T helper
        cells contact <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX>-specific B cells and provide signals
        for B cell differentiation via <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD154-CD40</ENAMEX> interactions, as
        well as by the production of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cytokines</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5 6</NUMEX> ] .
        Consistent with this general understanding of the induction
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> responses to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein immunogens</ENAMEX>, good antibody
        responses to synthetic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">peptide</ENAMEX>-epitope constructs have been
        shown to depend on the presence, orientation, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">multiplicity of the T</ENAMEX> cell epitope in the construct [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8 9</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11</NUMEX> ] . As a confirmation of this finding with synthetic
        epitope constructs, most <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein immunogens</ENAMEX> studied to date
        contain multiple T cell epitopes, for example [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13</NUMEX> ]
        .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">helper epitopes</ENAMEX> have become common components of
        synthetic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX> constructs due to their ability to
        provide immunological help for both humoral and
        cell-mediated responses [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 14 15 16</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> cell epitopes
        that can induce helper activity by binding to a wide range
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HLA-DR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alleles</ENAMEX> have been developed by a number of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> using various <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> systems [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18 19</NUMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> cell epitopes that have the property of binding across a
        wide range of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HLA-DR</ENAMEX> haplotypes are necessary for the
        construction of synthetic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccines</ENAMEX> that would be useful in
        the human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> as a whole. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>- and peptide-based
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccines</ENAMEX> have become popular due to the comparative ease of
        construction, the circumvention of potential safety issues
        around attenuated <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>, and for their potentially
        enhanced immunogenicity compared to heat-killed and subunit
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccines</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21 22</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA vaccines</ENAMEX> have the added
        attraction of efficiently priming both humoral and
        cytotoxic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> responses, a property largely lacking in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subunit</ENAMEX> and attenuated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism vaccines</ENAMEX>. Priming of
        cytotoxic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> responses is necessary for the design of
        therapeutic cancer <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccines</ENAMEX>, as well as for viral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccines</ENAMEX>.
        Multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen peptide vaccines</ENAMEX> can also be designed to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">contain T</ENAMEX> and B epitope regions from numerous protein
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigens</ENAMEX> derived from a complex infectious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> which
        could therefore confer broad protection without the
        potential dangers of an attenuated whole <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism vaccine</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> ] . However, it is of note that occasionally a
        well-designed peptide-based <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX> can elicit strong
        antibody responses to the synthetic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">immunogen</ENAMEX> that do not
        confer protection from the parasite to which they were
        originally designed [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . This may be due to either the
        induction of an inappropriate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody isotype</ENAMEX> in the mouse
        strain used, or to an inadequate overall response.
        While subunit <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccines</ENAMEX> have their inherent shortcomings,
        they carry the added benefit of potentially inducing
        complex antibody responses to multiple sites on the whole
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein immunogen</ENAMEX>. Subunit <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccines</ENAMEX> are of interest in the
        prevention of parasite infection [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] and for a variety
        of infectious diseases [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . An ideal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">subunit</ENAMEX> vaccine
        for the induction of protective antibody responses would be
        a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> from the disease-causing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> that was
        minimally modified from its original structure to retain a
        variety of potential B cell epitopes. In addition, the
        modified subunit <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccine</ENAMEX> would be designed to be highly
        immunogenic by the addition of promiscuous T cell epitopes.
        To this end, we have characterized the immune response of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">partially outbred Hartley strain guinea pigs</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> related
        bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">proteases</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> bacterial enzymes studied
        represent important industrial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">enzymes</ENAMEX> used in a number of
        applications, including serving as an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">additive</ENAMEX> for laundry
        products, and animal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">feed</ENAMEX> processing. These enzymes have
        been well characterized as to their activity and
        specificity by us and by others [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 27</NUMEX> ] . While these two
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 60%</NUMEX> homologous at the amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>
        sequence [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] , one of the proteases was significantly
        less immunogenic than the other. Reduced immunogenicity was
        characterized as significantly lower titers of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">antigen</ENAMEX>-specific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IgG</ENAMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> were immunized with the
        same amount of the enzymes. We determined the T cell
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epitopes</ENAMEX> in both of the proteases using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>-mer peptides and
        splenocytes from immunized <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>. In order to be
        classified as an epitope, the average proliferative
        response to a peptide had to reach a stimulation index of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.0</NUMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> regions met our criteria as epitopes in the
        immunogenic protease. We tested a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guinea pigs</ENAMEX>
        and found no epitope regions in the less immunogenic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">protease</ENAMEX>. A sequence comparison of the enzymes in the T
        cell epitope regions revealed that a single amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>
        change could confer a T cell epitope onto the
        less-immunogenic protease. This variant was constructed,
        and was found to be a functional and stable protease.
        Immunization of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hartley</ENAMEX> strain <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guinea pigs</ENAMEX> showed that this
        single amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> change created a T cell epitope where
        there was no detectable epitope before, and the presence of
        this epitope correlates with an improved immunogenicity in
        the variant. Finally, we show that the variant induces
        broadly cross-reactive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IgG antibodies</ENAMEX>, and that priming of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> with the variant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> results in higher titers
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX>-specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> upon subsequent immunization
        with the parent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enzyme</ENAMEX>.

          the amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> level. They are also comparable in their
          proteolytic activity and specificity [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 27</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Animals</ENAMEX>
          were immunized every <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks</TIMEX> with a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> ug dose of

          points, titers leveled off and the average titers induced
          by immunizations with 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. lentus</ENAMEX> subtilisin were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 10</NUMEX>

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">peptides</ENAMEX> offset by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> were used at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> Î¼M, and

          considered T cell epitopes. These epitopes are shown in

          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guinea pigs immunized</ENAMEX> with

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.01</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">non-parametric</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Student</ENAMEX>' t-test). Notably, the first
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. lentus subtilisin epitope</ENAMEX> has an
          analogous region in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPN</ENAMEX>' <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Y217L</TIMEX>. only the first amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>
          is different. It was hypothesized that if the first
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">valine</ENAMEX> in the analogous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPN</ENAMEX>' <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Y217L</NUMEX> sequence was changed
          to an isoleucine, a T cell epitope analogous to the one
          found in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. lentus subtilisin would be</ENAMEX>
          created. A modified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPN</ENAMEX>' <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Y217L V72I</NUMEX> enzyme (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">GP002</NUMEX>) was
          prepared with this single amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> change (Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Enzyme activity and stability
          Enzymatic activity has been implicated as a source of
          the allergenic property of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Der</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p1</ENAMEX>, the major dust mite
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">allergen</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30 31 32</NUMEX> ] . In order to account for this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">variable</ENAMEX>, the enzymatic activity of the variant protease
          GP002 was compared <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPN</ENAMEX>' <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Y217L</TIMEX>. Proteolytic activity was
          determined in a standard sAAPF hydrolysis assay. The
          activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GP002</ENAMEX> was found to be <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 80%</NUMEX> of
          the parent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPN</ENAMEX>' <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Y217L</NUMEX> enzyme (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). Another factor
          that could influence the immunogenicity of a proteolytic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enzyme</ENAMEX> is the relative stability of the protease. If the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">protease</ENAMEX> remains active for a longer period of time, any
          effects of the activity would be comparatively magnified.
          The half-lives of both enzymes were tested at <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">37Â°C</NUMEX> over a
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">74-hour</TIMEX> time period to assess relative stability. The
          assay was performed at physiologic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pH</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.3</NUMEX>. At various
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> points, the proteolytic activity remaining in the
          samples were tested. At <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">37 degrees</NUMEX> and a pH of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">7.3</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPN</ENAMEX>'
          Y217L has a half-life <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">fifty-five hours longer than GP002</TIMEX>.
          These results indicate that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enzymes</ENAMEX> have
          comparable stability and efficacy. Comparable enzymatic
          activity and stability suggest that the variant molecule
          has a similar tertiary configuration as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          T-cell epitope mapping <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPN</ENAMEX>' <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Y217L</NUMEX> versus
          GP002
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Hartley strain guinea pigs</ENAMEX> were immunized with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 Î</NUMEX>¼g
          per dose of either <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPN</ENAMEX>' <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Y217L</NUMEX> or GP002 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every two weeks</TIMEX>.
          After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6 weeks</TIMEX> epitope mapping was performed as described
          using the BPN'Y217L 15-mer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PepSet</ENAMEX> and splenocytes from
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">primed animals</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). In addition, proliferative
          responses to the intact inactivated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPN</ENAMEX>' <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Y217L</NUMEX> enzyme
          were tested. Immunization with GP002 resulted in an
          increased proliferative response to whole protein
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPN</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">'Y217L</ENAMEX>. The average stimulation index (proliferative

          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20 ug</TIMEX> of whole <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX>, versus an average
          stimulation index of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">11</NUMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPN</ENAMEX>' <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Y217L</NUMEX>-immunized
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">splenocytes</ENAMEX>. Epitope mapping with splenocytes from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPN</ENAMEX>'
          Y217L <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immunized guinea pigs</ENAMEX> revealed no epitope regions
          with an average stimulation index of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3.0</NUMEX> in any of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> tested (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). This is consistent with our
          previous results for this enzyme, using splenocytes from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals immunized</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 ug</NUMEX> per dose of enzyme every <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two</TIMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 weeks</TIMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> of the GP002
          immunized <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> responded with stimulation indices of
          greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.0</NUMEX> to the modified epitope region in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPN</ENAMEX>'
          Y217L (peptide <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#25</NUMEX>). The average response to this peptide
          was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 4.0</NUMEX>. Peptide <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#25</NUMEX> is offset from the T
          cell epitope described in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.</ENAMEX> lentus by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>. This is
          a result of creating linear <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">15-mers</NUMEX> from the two

          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPN</ENAMEX>' <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Y217L</NUMEX> sequence. Primed splenocytes from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">guinea</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pigs</ENAMEX> also respond to peptide <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#24</NUMEX> that is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>
          offset towards to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">N-terminus</ENAMEX>, and subsequently overlaps
          with the T cell epitope region. The creation of a T cell
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epitope</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPN</ENAMEX>' <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Y217L</NUMEX> also resulted in the display of a
          complex set of weak epitopes in the molecule. Peptides
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#25 and #75</NUMEX> induced average responses over the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> animals
          that reached an <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.I.</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 3.0</NUMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Five</NUMEX> peptide
          regions induced average responses of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 2.5</NUMEX>.
          Therefore, creation of a strong T cell epitope in this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein initiates</ENAMEX> an immune response that leads to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diversification of T</ENAMEX> cell responses to other regions of
          the molecule.

          In order to test whether the modified enzyme could
          induce higher titers of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX>-specific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IgG</ENAMEX> now that it
          carried a strong T cell epitope, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guinea pigs</ENAMEX> were
          immunized with increasing doses of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPN</ENAMEX>' <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Y217L</NUMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GP002</TIMEX>.
          Serum <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> were taken <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every two weeks</TIMEX> and titers were
          calculated. Average titers for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> are
          shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>. Immunization with the modified enzyme
          resulted in higher titers of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX>-specific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IgG</ENAMEX> at
          early time points in the immunization protocol (Figure
          6a). At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">later</TIMEX> points during the immunization protocol,
          lower doses of the variant induced higher titers than the
          parent (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6b</TIMEX>, c, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">d</ENAMEX>). At <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four weeks</TIMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> ug dose
          GP002 induced an average serum dilution titer of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,000</NUMEX>

          a p value of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.03</NUMEX> when calculated using a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-tailed,

          A potential explanation for the increase in antibody
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">titers</ENAMEX> is that the modification in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GP002</TIMEX> results in a
          conformationally distinct molecule with unique surface
          regions, thereby increasing the total number of antibody
          binding sites. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Guinea pig</ENAMEX> serum samples from animals
          immunized with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 Î¼g</NUMEX> of enzyme were used to determine the
          position of linear <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B-cell</ENAMEX> epitopes in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPN</ENAMEX>' Y217L (Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">serum samples</ENAMEX> were drawn at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX>, and whole
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein titers</ENAMEX> are shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>. Serum samples from
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> immunized with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPN</ENAMEX>' <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Y217L</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> animals
          immunized with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GP002</TIMEX> were tested on biotinylated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>-mer
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">peptides</ENAMEX> (offset by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>). Serum was diluted
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1:</TIMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX> for all tests. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Guinea pig IgG</ENAMEX> was detected with
          HRP-conjugated anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">IgG</ENAMEX>. The average optical densities
          for each peptide were divided by the background. The
          average result for each peptide is shown. The linear
          B-cell epitope regions recognized by both polyclonal
          serum <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> are similar. The amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid modification</ENAMEX> in
          GP002 would be in the region of peptides <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#13 to #16</NUMEX>. If
          the amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid modification</ENAMEX> produced a B cell epitope at
          this site, it does not cross-react onto the unmodified
          peptide regions tested here. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPN</ENAMEX>'
          Y217L molecule detected in this assay are predicted
          external loops (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Dr.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Bott</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genencor International</ENAMEX>,
          personal communication). The major regions recognized,
          peptides <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#3 and 4</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#17 and 18</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#46 and 47</NUMEX> are
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">equivalently</ENAMEX> recognized by both serum sets. Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX>
          regions of the molecule showing an average <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-fold
          increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">IgG</ENAMEX> binding over the background, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> of these
          regions are detected more strongly by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the GP002</TIMEX> sera. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>
          peptide regions are uniquely detected by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPN</ENAMEX>' Y217L
          serum, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> are uniquely recognized by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the GP002</TIMEX> serum.
          There is a shift in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> epitope region from peptides
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#38-43</NUMEX> where the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GP002 antibody</ENAMEX> epitope runs from peptide
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38 to peptide 41</NUMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPN</ENAMEX>' <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Y217L</TIMEX>'s runs from peptide <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX>
          to peptide <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43</NUMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">This 10</TIMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> shift forward indicates
          a slight difference in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein folding</ENAMEX>. This difference
          has little apparent effect on the other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> epitopes
          delineated by this assay. This assay demonstrates that
          GP002-specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IgG antibodies</ENAMEX> readily cross-react with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPN</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Y217L linear antibody epitopes</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPN</ENAMEX>' <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Y217L</NUMEX> and GP002 Priming Immunizations
          It was of interest to determine whether increased
          titers of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IgG antibodies</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPN</ENAMEX>' Y217L could be induced
          by priming <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> with the T cell epitope-containing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variant</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> sets of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guinea pigs</ENAMEX> were immunized
          with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 Î¼g</NUMEX> of enzyme over a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">six-week</TIMEX> period in series. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> were immunized <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times, once every <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks</TIMEX>.
          This protocol was chosen to correspond with the titer
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> presented in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group A</ENAMEX> was immunized three
          times with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPN</ENAMEX>' <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Y217L</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group</ENAMEX> B was immunized <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> with
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">GP002</NUMEX>, and then twice with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPN</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">'Y217L</ENAMEX>. Group C was
          immunized the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> times with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the GP002</TIMEX>, and the
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> time with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPN</ENAMEX>' <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Y217L</TIMEX>.
          Finally, Group D was immunized <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> times with
          GP002. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Two weeks</TIMEX> after the last immunization serum
          samples were taken and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ELISAs</ENAMEX> were performed to compare
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">titers</ENAMEX>. All <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ELISAs</ENAMEX> were performed using the parent
          enzyme, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPN</ENAMEX>' <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Y217L</NUMEX>, as a plate coating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">reagent</ENAMEX>. Results
          clearly show once again that immunization with GP002
          induces over <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10-fold</NUMEX> higher levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX>-specific
          IgG than the unmodified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> enzyme (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>). The
          difference between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> A and D was highly significant
          (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.01</NUMEX>). In addition, a single immunization with
          the T cell epitope modified variant <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GP002</ENAMEX> is sufficient
          to induce higher levels of parent-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">enzyme</NUMEX>-specific IgG
          after subsequent immunizations with the unmodified parent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enzyme</ENAMEX>. While the average titer increased by
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-fold, the difference between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> A
          and B was not statistically significant. Each group
          contained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, with appreciable scatter in
          the individual responses. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> immunizations with GP002
          prior to immunizing with the parent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enzyme</ENAMEX> did not
          improve the titers as compared to a single priming
          immunization with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">GP002</TIMEX>. This result suggests that
          priming with the variant enzyme can induce higher levels
          of cross-reactive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IgG antibodies</ENAMEX> than immunization with
          the unmodified variant alone. This experiment also
          confirms that GP002 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">immunized animals</ENAMEX> produce high titers
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IgG</ENAMEX> that cross-react on the whole <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPN</ENAMEX>' Y217L
          molecule.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        We have shown that a single conservative amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>
        change in a bacterial subtilisin enzyme can create a strong
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> cell epitope in our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guinea pig</ENAMEX> model. Immunization of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">guinea pigs</ENAMEX> with this modified variant results in an
        improved cross-reactive immune response to the unmodified
        parent enzyme in both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX>-specific IgG antibody
        production and T cell proliferative responses. The improved
        immunogenicity of the variant was not related to changes in
        the proteolytic capacity of the enzyme, because the variant
        exhibited <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX> of the activity of the parent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enzyme</ENAMEX>. The
        introduction of a single T cell epitope apparently allowed
        for the diversification of T cell responses to the protein
        because <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple epitopes</ENAMEX> were found in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPN</ENAMEX>' Y217L
        sequence after immunization of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> with the variant
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). An increase in the complexity of the T cell
        response is consistent with an increase in overall antibody
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">titer</ENAMEX> to the enzyme, as more T cell helper activity is
        potentially available. The antibody responses to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variant</ENAMEX> and parent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enzymes</ENAMEX> were shown to be largely
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">overlapping</ENAMEX>, indicating that the increase in the antibody
        titers seen were not due to the addition of a novel
        structure capable of being recognized by unique antibody
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">specificities</ENAMEX>. This is shown by the last experiment where
        priming with the variant enzyme increased <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> titers
        to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> enzyme upon subsequent immunizations.
        It was of interest that the unmodified protease induces
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">antigen</ENAMEX>-specific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IgG</ENAMEX> in the absence of detectable
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunodominant T</ENAMEX> cell epitopes. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPN</ENAMEX>' <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Y217L</NUMEX> may possess weak
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> cell epitopes that are below our limit of detection in
        our cell culture assay. Our criterion for an epitope was an
        average stimulation index of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.0</NUMEX>. In addition, it is
        notable that both of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">immunogens</ENAMEX> tested display
        considerable proteolytic activity. The proteolytic activity
        of the parent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enzyme</ENAMEX> could be responsible for inducing T
        cell independent B cell differentiation via a number of
        different mechanisms [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33 34 35</NUMEX> ] . Finally, we have seen
        than both chemically inactivated and an inactive variant of
        the parent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">protease</ENAMEX> used in these experiments are incapable
        of inducing IgG1 in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> model (data not shown). The
        proteolytic activity of these molecules also acts as an
        adjuvant for specific IgG production [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] .
        The ability to induce improved immune responses by the
        subtle changes described here could have a number of
        potentially vital applications. The use of a T cell
        epitope-modified whole <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> immunogen confers a number
        of advantages. The first advantage is the priming of a
        diverse immune response to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> that allows the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> of both a complex and robust T helper responses,
        and secondly the concomitant affinity maturation of the
        antibody response to naturally occurring <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody epitopes</ENAMEX>.
        This is especially relevant to the design of subunit
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccines</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">malaria</ENAMEX> and schistosomiasis where high titers
        of high affinity <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> are usually the best defence
        against invading organisms [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 16 24</NUMEX> ] . Creating T cell
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epitopes</ENAMEX> in expressed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> has been demonstrated here
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hartley</ENAMEX> strain <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guinea pigs</ENAMEX>, and for various inbred
        strains of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37 38</NUMEX> ] . Interestingly, the introduction
        of T cell epitopes from a hen-egg <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lysozyme</ENAMEX> or ovalbumin
        into mouse TNF-alpha also resulted in an increased
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross</ENAMEX>-reactive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> response in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] . However,
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> construct was no longer cytotoxic for L929
        cells, suggesting that the modified <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> was not in the
        correct tertiary configuration. Incorrect tertiary
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">configuration</ENAMEX> could lead to the production of specific
        antibodies that do not cross-react with the native
        molecule. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> cell responses to the variants were not well
        characterized. In this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>, and in the report from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tsujihata</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] T cell epitopes were created within the
        molecule of interest, without affecting the activity of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enzyme</ENAMEX>. We created a naturally occurring T cell epitope by
        comparison to a related <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. In addition, we found that
        the creation of a T cell epitope in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPN</ENAMEX>' <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Y217L</NUMEX> resulted in
        a complex pattern of T cell response to the enzyme. The
        challenge of utilizing this technique for the creation of
        subunit <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vaccines</ENAMEX> for the human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> will be to create
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> cell epitopes within a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> of interest that will not
        have deleterious effects on the activity or the stability
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> of interest, and that would be effective
        across a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HLA-DR haplotypes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] .
        The improved <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> response measured in this paper
        was increased titers of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guinea pig polyclonal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">IgG</ENAMEX>. We did
        not measure potential differences in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guinea pig</ENAMEX> IgG
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">isotypes</ENAMEX>. Changing the interaction of peptide, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> II
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">molecules</ENAMEX>, T cell <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX>-presenting
        cell specific ligand interactions to foster stronger,
        higher affinity T cell signalling has been shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">skew T</ENAMEX> cell differentiation from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Th2</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Th1</NUMEX>-like patterns [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50</NUMEX> ] . Differences in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Th</ENAMEX>-differentiation patterns have downstream effects on the
        type of immune response mounted, and in particular on the
        isotypes of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> expressed. This has been well

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentiation</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hartley</ENAMEX> strain <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">guinea pigs</ENAMEX>.
        In our system, we cannot distinguish if the amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>
        change we have created has its effects on binding to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">guinea pig</ENAMEX> MHC, interaction with the T cell receptor, or
        more efficient processing of the epitope from the protein
        precursor [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">51</TIMEX> ] . Any or all of these mechanisms could
        contribute to the enrichment for peptide-specific
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proliferative</ENAMEX> responses seen in vitro.
        The ability to up regulate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> and T cell responses
        to whole <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> immunogens by the modification of T cell
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">epitopes</ENAMEX> suggests that the converse would also be possible.
        Down regulation of T cell responses to functionally intact
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enzymes</ENAMEX> would have obvious implications for both existing
        and potential <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein therapeutics</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Conclusions
        The immunogenicity of an enzyme can be increased, while
        maintaining the majority of its stability and proteolytic
        activity, by incorporating a single amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> change. The
        variant enzyme was found to have a major T cell epitope
        where none existed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX>. In addition to the
        increased cellular response, humoral responses were
        increased at low doses, and as well for high doses early in
        the immunization schedule. Enhancing the T cell response to
        an enzyme, in addition to the humoral response, has
        applications in the construction of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">recombinant vaccines</ENAMEX> as
        well as in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-based therapeutics.

          Enzyme activity and stability measurements
          Proteolytic activity was measured by hydrolysis of the
          substrate succinyl-AAPF-p-nitroanilide (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">suc-AAPF-pNA</ENAMEX>).
          Serial dilutions of the proteases were made in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> mM
