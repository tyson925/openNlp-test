        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> recent reports, from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Study of Osteoporotic</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fractures</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Framingham</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fracture</ENAMEX>
        Intervention Trial [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] demonstrated a positive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> between bone mineral density measurements (BMD)
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> and subsequent onset of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX>. All of
        these reports were regarded as significant because estrogen
        has been thought to increase breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> risk [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMD</ENAMEX> may be a more accurate measure of long term estrogen
        exposure than recall of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormone</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">supplementation</ENAMEX>,
        measurements of endogenous estrogen, parity, or obesity [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> ] .
        In the light of strong <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> previously noted
        between estrogens and corpus uteri <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMD</ENAMEX> should
        predict the occurrence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">endometrial cancer</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] , though
        this has not yet been directly assessed. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMD</ENAMEX> also reflects
        exposure to calcium and to physical activity as well as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">foods</ENAMEX> affecting calcium absorption and deposition [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8 9</NUMEX> ]
        . All of these factors, including estrogen, are thought to
        diminish the risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">colorectal cancer</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11</NUMEX> ] . On the
        other hand increased calcium intake has been associated
        with increased risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">prostate cancer</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13</NUMEX> ] . Because
        of the intimate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMD</ENAMEX> with to all of these
        exposure variables, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMD</ENAMEX> needs to be examined in relation to
        each of these <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX>. In this report we use the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">NHANES I</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Epidemiological Followup Study</ENAMEX> to pursue <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> hypotheses
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">relating BMD</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>: that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMD</ENAMEX> will correlate directly
        with subsequent breast, uterus, and prostate cancer
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">incidence</ENAMEX>, and that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMD</ENAMEX> will correlate inversely with
        subsequent colorectal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer incidence</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Methods
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First National Health and Nutrition Examination</ENAMEX>
        Survey (NHANES I) collected data from a national
        probability sample of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> civilian
        noninstitutionalized <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between the ages of one</TIMEX> and
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seventy-four years</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . The initial survey took place
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">from 1971 through 1974</TIMEX>. In addition to the emphasis on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nutrition</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">NHANES I</ENAMEX>, a subset sample of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 25-74</TIMEX>
        received a more detailed health examination through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1975</TIMEX>. This additional exam included a hand/wrist x-ray.
        This was successfully completed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">413</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>. Each
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">x-ray</ENAMEX> was a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">posterior</ENAMEX>/anterior view of the left hand and
        wrist taken by direct exposure using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 Ã— 12</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eastman</ENAMEX>
        Industrial Type AA "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Ready Pak</ENAMEX>" film. The prescribed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">radiography</ENAMEX> technique called for a focus to film distance
        of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">36 inches</NUMEX> with the focal spot centered on the midpoint
        of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> metacarpal. These hand/wrist x-rays were
        originally evaluated for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMD</ENAMEX> by photo densitometry
        measurements of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">phalanx</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V-2</ENAMEX> and the radius. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMD</ENAMEX> was
        determined from the radiography using a reference wedge.
        The hand/wrist x-rays have since been reread for bone
        density using a technique called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Osteo Gram Radiographic</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Absorptiometry</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>) by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Compu-Med Incorporated</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMD</ENAMEX> could
        not be calculated using this method for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">153</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6, 413</ENAMEX>
        subjects with hand x-rays due to improper exposure, poor
        picture quality, damaged or missing film. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Records</ENAMEX> for the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">260</NUMEX> cases that have been reread are contained in the
        Public Use File (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Radiography Absorptiometry Bone Density</ENAMEX>).
        Additional data on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> can be found in an introduction to
        that public use file. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> has been found to have an
        excellent precision (CV of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.6%</NUMEX>) and accuracy and to
        correlate well with other accepted methods of bone
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">densitometry</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> on disease incidence were obtained on the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">NHANES I Epidemiologic Followup</ENAMEX>
        Studies (NHEFS), which was conducted in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> waves of data
        collection through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> collected included in depth
        interviews with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> or their proxies, hospital
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">records</ENAMEX>, including pathology reports, and collection of
        death certificates for deceased subjects. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tracing</ENAMEX> is
        complete for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> of the cohort through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>.
        Those with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> follow-up record in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NHEFS</ENAMEX> were
        included in the analysis, resulting in a final sample size
        of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,046</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Disease outcomes</ENAMEX> were obtained using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ICD-9</ENAMEX> codes
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Classification</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Diseases</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">9th Revision</ENAMEX>)
        from death certificates and hospital record diagnostic
        codes in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">NHEFS</ENAMEX> mortality and health care <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> stay data
        bases, respectively. They were: <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">uterine cancer</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">179</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">182.0</NUMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">182.1</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">182.8</NUMEX>), colorectal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">153.0</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">154.3</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">154.8</NUMEX>),
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">174.0</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">174.9</NUMEX>), prostate <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">185</ENAMEX>), hip
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fractures</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">820.0</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">820.3</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">820.8</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">820.9</NUMEX>), and osteoporosis
        (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">733.00</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">733.03</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">733.09</NUMEX>).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Person-years</ENAMEX> of follow-up were computed for each cohort
        as the amount of time since the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">NHANES I</ENAMEX> examination to the
        date of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> of the following events: date of ICD-9
        disease code of interest from the health care <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> stay
        files, date of death from the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">NHEFS</ENAMEX> mortality file, or the
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last day</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contact</ENAMEX> from the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX> NHEFS vital status file.
        Thus, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> were right-censored at either death or last
        date of follow-up. For <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> hospital
        admission listing a particular disease outcome of interest,
        the date of the earliest admission for that disease was
        used. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Person-years</ENAMEX> of follow-up were calculated separately
        for each disease outcome. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Cohorts</ENAMEX> who reported at baseline
        a history of hip fracture were excluded from the hip
        fracture analysis (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>) for a total sample
        size of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5989</TIMEX>, and those who reported a prior malignant
        tumor or growth were excluded from the cancer analyses (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">120</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">49</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>) for total sample sizes of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5877</TIMEX> for the
        colorectal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> analysis, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3108</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">uterine cancer analyses</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2769</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> for the prostate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> analysis.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Cohorts</ENAMEX> were divided into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> groups according to their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>
        BMD: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"><95</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">95-105</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">105-115, >115</ENAMEX> (mass/volume units
        established by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Compu-Med</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chi</ENAMEX> square tests for trend and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">linear</ENAMEX> regression analysis using a single variable for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA-BMD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> were used to evaluate the relationship of BMD
        to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>, gender, age and ethnicity, as appropriate. For each
        diagnosis of interest, incidence rates were calculated for
        each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> by dividing the number of cases of disease
        by the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>-years of follow-up. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cox</ENAMEX>
        proportional-hazards <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> were fitted for disease
        outcomes with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> using the PHREG procedure from the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS System</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Windows Version 8.01</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Covariates</ENAMEX> in the
        analysis were age at <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">NHANES I</ENAMEX> examination (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"><35</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35-50</NUMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50-60</NUMEX>, and ><TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60 years</TIMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> mass index (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>; weight in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">kg/height</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">m 2</ENAMEX>) at <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">NHANES I</ENAMEX> examination (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"><22</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22-25</NUMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25-28</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">>28</NUMEX>), and <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">race</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Caucasian</ENAMEX> versus other). Analyses
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">colorectal cancer</ENAMEX>, hip fractures and osteoporosis
        outcomes were adjusted for gender. Similar models,
        replacing the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> indicator variables for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA BMD</ENAMEX> with a
        single variable for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA BMD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, were tested to determine
        the significance of the trend in risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>. For the
        analysis including only <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> older than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">55 years</TIMEX>, the
        cohort was divided into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> groups according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMD</ENAMEX> quartile.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMD</ENAMEX> quartile with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> in women
        older than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">55</TIMEX> was tested using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cox</ENAMEX> proportional hazards
        models as described above. Covariates included in the model
        were indicator variables for quartile of age, quartile of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">race</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Caucasian</ENAMEX> versus other). Since we would
        expect that age would be exponentially related to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>,
        and for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast</ENAMEX> and uterine cancer the slope of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">exponential</ENAMEX> line would change after menopause, the use of
        age categories did not constrain age to be linearly related
        to the outcome.
      
      
        Results
        The BMD sample of NHANES I included <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">046 individuals</ENAMEX>
        who had bone density read by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> and follow-up data in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NHEFS</ENAMEX>. This group included <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">252 Caucasians</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">742</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Americans</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">52</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hispanic</ENAMEX> origin. There
        were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">818</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">228</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. The median age at the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> of bone density reading was slightly less than 50
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1describes</ENAMEX> the relationship of gender and race
        to age, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> mass index, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMD</ENAMEX> within the cohort.
        By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>, a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">103</NUMEX> cases of osteoporosis, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">110</NUMEX> cases
        of reported hip fracture, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">115</NUMEX> cases of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">colorectal cancer</ENAMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> cases of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">94</NUMEX> cases of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">prostate cancer</ENAMEX> and
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX> cases of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">uterine cancer</ENAMEX> had been reported within this
        subset of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">NHANES I</ENAMEX> cohort. Significant inverse
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associations</ENAMEX> were seen with both osteoporosis and hip
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fracture</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>) after adjustment for age, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>, race, and
        gender.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3describes</ENAMEX> the relationship of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMD</ENAMEX> to uterine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> risk. After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX>, race and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> adjustment there was a
        significant (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.005</NUMEX>) trend to increasing risk with
        increasing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BMD</ENAMEX>.
        A trend was not seen between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMD</ENAMEX> and the subsequent
        incidence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> in the overall cohort (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>:
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.74</NUMEX>). However, in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> who were over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the age of 55</TIMEX> (n
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">= 1091</ENAMEX>), that is, probably after the age of menopause at
        the time that their BMD was measured, a positive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMD</ENAMEX> and breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> was suggested (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> =
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.04</NUMEX> for trend in a quartile comparison). A total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancers</ENAMEX> developed in this latter, older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX>.
        There was an inverse <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMD</ENAMEX> with colorectal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> after adjustment for age, race, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>, and gender that
        was statistically significance (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.03</NUMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5</ENAMEX>).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Prostate cancer</ENAMEX> risk was not significantly associated
        with increasing levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMD</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.37</NUMEX>), although there
        were diminished risks in upper quartiles of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMD</ENAMEX>, which was
        in the opposite direction of our hypothesis (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 6</ENAMEX>).
      
      
        Discussion
        
          Hip fracture and osteoporosis
          As in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Framingham</ENAMEX> cohort, the choice of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone</ENAMEX> for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">BMD</ENAMEX> measurement in NHANES I was the metacarpal [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] .
          Much has been written about the optimal choice of bone
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMD</ENAMEX> measurement, though no clear preference has
          dominated this literature [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16 17</NUMEX> ] . Because we
          assumed that the most direct consequences of diminished
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMD</ENAMEX> would be osteoporosis and hip fracture, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associations</ENAMEX>
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMD</ENAMEX> with hip fracture and the development of
          osteoporosis were investigated in order to establish the
          validity of this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMD</ENAMEX> measurement in this cohort. As
          anticipated, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NHEFS</ENAMEX>, diminished <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMD</ENAMEX> is
          significantly associated with the development of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">osteoporosis</ENAMEX> and hip fracture (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          Uterine cancer
          This is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> report that examines the
          relationship of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMD</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">uterine cancer</ENAMEX>. Because the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> of estrogen exposure and uterine cancer
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX> is far less controversial than estrogen and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> risk [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] , the veracity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMD</ENAMEX> as a
          measure of estrogen exposure is supported by the
          significant positive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMD</ENAMEX> with uterine
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer incidence</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Breast cancer</ENAMEX>
          Although no association between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMD</ENAMEX> and subsequent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> incidence was found for all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> in the
          cohort, a weak but significant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> was seen in
          those over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">55 years of age</TIMEX> at the time of BMD
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">measurement</ENAMEX>, i.e. post menopause. The total number of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> cases is comparable to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> studies
          discussed below, as is the size of the cohort. However,
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> previous studies all recruited peri- and
          post-menopausal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3</NUMEX> ] , an age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> that
          comprised just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than half</NUMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">NHANES I</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMD</ENAMEX> cohort. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">NHANES I female BMD</ENAMEX> cohort size and
          number of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> cases in this post-menopausal
          subgroup are therefore smaller than the other studies.
          Nevertheless, there is a significant, though unstable
          trend towards increasing breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> risk with rising
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMD</ENAMEX> in those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> recruited to NHANES I older than 55
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>).
          The relationship of estrogen exposure to subsequent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> risk has been the subject of much debate
          and investigation [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . The debate is all the more
          significant because of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">estrogen</ENAMEX>'s possible role in the
          prevention of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">coronary heart disease</ENAMEX> mortality, hip
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fracture</ENAMEX> and osteoporosis [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> studies were
          greeted with great enthusiasm because they added a new
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">perspective</ENAMEX> to the debate, correlating BMD with breast
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> risk. In so doing they seemed to confirm that
          estrogen exposure over a long period of time increased
          the risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3</NUMEX> ] , (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 7</ENAMEX>). In the
          Study of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Osteoporotic Fractures</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">854</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> greater
          than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">65 years old</TIMEX> had their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMD</ENAMEX> measured and were
          followed-up for an average of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3.2 years</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ninety</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> developed breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . The incidence rate
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> varied from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.46</NUMEX> cases / <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX> person
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> in the lowest quartile of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone mineral density</ENAMEX> to
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.99</NUMEX> cases / <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX> person <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> in the highest quartile
          (relative risk <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.50</NUMEX>: <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> confidence interval = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.16</NUMEX> to
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.95</NUMEX>).
          In the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Framingham</ENAMEX> study, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">373</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 47 to 80</TIMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> had bone density measured from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1967 to 1970</TIMEX>. By
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">91</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> developed breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . The age
          adjusted rate ratios for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> from the lowest to
          the highest quartile of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMD</ENAMEX> were <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.0</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.3</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.3</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX>
          respectively. However, the effect was found to be far
          greater in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> with a positive family history of breast
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Framingham</ENAMEX> report. Among those without a
          family history of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX>, the risk was not
          significantly increased [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] .
          In the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Fracture Intervention Trial</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">8203</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">postmenopausal</ENAMEX> women <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 54 and 80 years of age</TIMEX> were
          enrolled in a therapeutic trial related to fracture
          prevention [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . With a maximum of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five years</TIMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">follow-up</ENAMEX>, a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">158</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> were found to have breast
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">131</NUMEX> of which received the diagnosis <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">more than six</TIMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> after enrollment, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">102</NUMEX> of which were invasive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX>. Treatment (alendronate for osteoporosis) in the
          randomized trial did not alter <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> risk. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Age</ENAMEX>
          adjusted risk increased with increasing quartiles of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMD</ENAMEX>,
          though marginal statistical significance was achieved for
          invasive <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> only in the highest versus lowest BMD
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">quartiles</ENAMEX> (OR = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.8</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.0</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.2</NUMEX>). Unlike
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Framingham</ENAMEX>, family history of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> did not alter
          the results related to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMD</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Calcium</ENAMEX> and vitamin D
          ingestion were found to be associated with diminished
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> risk. This might imply that the estrogen
          effect on <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> risk, as manifested in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMD</ENAMEX>, could
          have been diminished by increasing exposure to calcium
          and vitamin D.
          An indirect method has been employed to assess the
          relationship of estrogen exposure to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> risk
          through bone density assessment: the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of
          osteoporotic fracture to the prior or subsequent
          diagnosis of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">uterine cancer</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 7</ENAMEX>). One
          recent large case/control study presents compelling
          evidence for diminished risk of previous recent fracture
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> with both <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">uterine cancer</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] .
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Four earlier</TIMEX> reports of fracture and breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> were
          evenly divided in their results, though the negative
          studies included fracture after the diagnosis of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21 23 24</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Uterine cancer</ENAMEX> has also been assessed in
          all but one of these reports [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 22 23</NUMEX> ] and found to be
          positively associated with fracture in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>.
        
        
          Colorectal cancer
          The results of these analyses show a protective trend
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMD</ENAMEX> for colorectal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> that is statistically
          significant (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Estrogen</ENAMEX> is thought to diminish
          risk for colorectal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>, though there has been
          variation in findings concerning which subsite within the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">colorectum</ENAMEX> is protected by estrogen exposure. Other
          factors related to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMD</ENAMEX> are also thought to effect
          colorectal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> risk, positively (age, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> mass index,
          smoking) or negatively (calcium, estrogen, physical
          activity) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 10</ENAMEX> ] . Of these, the most widely
          investigated has been calcium. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twenty-four</NUMEX> analytic
          studies of calcium in cohort and case/control designs
          have been reported. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only ten</NUMEX> of these have shown a
          significant decrease in colon <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> risk associated with
          calcium intake. In addition, there have been <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> studies of
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">vitamin</TIMEX> D intake, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 3</NUMEX> of which have shown decreased
          colorectal <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> risk related to increased vitamin <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> ] .
          The reason for these inconsistent results relating to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">calcium</ENAMEX> may be that calcium nutriture is difficult to
          measure. Bioavailability of calcium is related to the
          intake of other nutrients, which include dietary fiber
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">phytate</NUMEX>), phosphate, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alcohol</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tea</ENAMEX> (tannins). Each
          can alter colorectal cancer risk. Therefore, serum
          calcium levels and dietary intake do not necessarily
          reflect endogenous content. As with iron, endogenous
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">calcium</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> may be the more significant effector of
          risk than dietary calcium intake [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] . In the case of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">calcium</ENAMEX>, the measure of endogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMD</ENAMEX>.
          The investigation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMD</ENAMEX> and colorectal cancer risk,
          therefore, provides a new perspective in the analysis of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">calcium</ENAMEX> and colorectal cancer risk, and in addition
          provides information on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> other factors for colorectal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> that are thought to diminish risk: physical
          activity and estrogen [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . This is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> such
          report analyzing this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Prostatic cancer
          Reported herein is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> study to obtain BMD
          measurement prior to the diagnosis of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">prostate cancer</ENAMEX>,
          and no <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> was found (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 6</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Calcium</ENAMEX> ingestion
          has also been associated with increased risk of prostate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11</NUMEX> ] . The only study to look at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMD</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">prostate cancer</ENAMEX> risk was a case/control design. It showed
          no <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX>, although cases already had prostate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMD</ENAMEX> was measured and controls were patients
          with other <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">urologic diseases</ENAMEX> or presenting for prostate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> screening [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] .
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMD</ENAMEX> and estrogen
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMD</ENAMEX> is affected by many factors other than estrogen,
          including principally age, calcium, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> mass index,
          cigarette smoking, physical activity, and prior bone
          injury. As such it is a non-specific indicator of risk.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMD</ENAMEX> was also measured in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">NHANES I</ENAMEX> at a time when
          post-menopausal use of estrogen was rare. Its increasing
          use in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent decades</TIMEX> may have altered the subsequent
          risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> in these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. Nevertheless, the results
          seen in opposite directions in uterus and colorectum
          suggest that estrogen exposure at least up to the point
          at which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMD</ENAMEX> was measured was a significant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediator</ENAMEX> of
          risk for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NHANES I.</ENAMEX> The weakly positive results
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> in combination with previously
          published reports suggest that, unlike the other
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">endpoints</ENAMEX> reported herein, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMD</ENAMEX> as a predictor of breast
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> risk is only of use when measured after
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">menopause</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        In summary, this <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">NHANES I</ENAMEX> cohort follow-up is the first
        report of analyses of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMD</ENAMEX> and subsequent risk for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> of
        the colorectum and uterus, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX>
        risk and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">prostate cancer</ENAMEX>. A strong positive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> was seen between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMD</ENAMEX> and corpus uteri <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>,
        and a significant trend towards decreasing colorectal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> risk with increasing BMD. There is an insignificant
        decline in risk for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">prostate cancer</ENAMEX> with increasing BMD, a
        direction opposite of our initial hypothesis. A weak
        relationship could be detected between breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMD</ENAMEX> only when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMD</ENAMEX> was measured after menopause. Significant
        inverse <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> were found between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMD</ENAMEX>, osteoporosis
        and hip fracture.
