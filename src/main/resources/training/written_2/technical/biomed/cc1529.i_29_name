        In treating <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with severe <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> are
        mainly concerned with biologic, physiologic, and clinical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">outcomes</ENAMEX>. Of those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who survive to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">discharge</ENAMEX>, little is known regarding their physical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">functioning</ENAMEX> (ability to conduct activities of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> life
        such as walking around), psychologic functioning (mental
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">well-being</ENAMEX>), and social functioning (communication and
        relationships with others) after <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX>. Because 'quality
        of life' (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QoL</ENAMEX>) describes or characterizes what the patient
        has experienced as a result of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX> care, it is a useful
        and important supplement to traditional physiologic or
        biologic measures of health status; that is, assessments of
        effectiveness need to include wider measures of benefits to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, and particularly those that measure the impact
        from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s point of view. A relevant therapeutic
        benefit may also be in restoring the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s ability to
        function on a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> basis, to socialize, and to be alert.
        In fact, a long-term focus on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QoL</ENAMEX> in clinical trial
        evaluations was among the recommendations of a recent
        sepsis international advisory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>].
        This report presents the results of an evaluation of QoL
        among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sepsis survivors</ENAMEX>, done as part of the phase III
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">multicenter KyberSept</ENAMEX> trial. To the best of our knowledge,
        limited information on the effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX> treatment on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QoL</ENAMEX> has been reported [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2, 3</ENAMEX>]. The report focuses on the
        effects of antithrombin (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT</ENAMEX>) III therapy related to
        physical, mental, and social functioning of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who
        were randomly assigned to either high-dose intravenous
        treatment with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kybernin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P ®</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aventis Behring, Marburg</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>; a plasma-derived AT III concentrate, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30,000</NUMEX> IU
        over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4 days</TIMEX>) or placebo during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">up to 90 days</TIMEX> of follow up.
        In the trial, overall survival tended to favor AT III over
        placebo after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">90 days</TIMEX> of follow up, although the
        differences were nominal. However, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT III</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> that
        did not receive concomitant heparin exhibited a nominally
        statistically significant survival advantage over placebo
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at 90 days</TIMEX> of follow-up. The purpose of this investigation
        was to establish whether these trends also held for the
        subjective effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT III</ENAMEX> in severe <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX>. It concludes
        that AT III treatment is effective in improving long-term
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">patient QoL</ENAMEX>, and that future outcome research studies of
        severe <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX> should follow up <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> throughout their
        hospital stay and after discharge.
      
      
        Method
        
          Quality of life instruments
          There are a number of important conceptual and
          methodologic issues in assessing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QoL</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> who are
          critically ill, not least of which is the question of how
          it should be defined. Recent attempts to define <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QoL</ENAMEX> have
          resulted in the development of a functional definition
          that is measurable, evaluable over time, and readily
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">applied</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> over a wide range of illness
          severity. Most attempts incorporate the domains of
          physical, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">psychologic</ENAMEX>/cognitive, and social functioning.
          Each of these domains can be measured in two dimensions:
          objective assessments of functioning or health status;
          and more subjective perceptions of general health. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s subjective experience translates that objective
          assessment into the actual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QoL</ENAMEX> experienced. Thus, where
          the term 'QoL' is used in the present study, it refers to
          a composite of objective functional impairment and
          subjective perceptions and expectations. The instruments
          chosen for the study were designed to reflect this.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QoL</ENAMEX> gives information on what medical care has
          achieved for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>, but severe <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX> is a
          difficult area in which to obtain such information.
          Normally, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QoL</ENAMEX> data should be obtained directly from the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>. Unfortunately, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> hospitalized with severe
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sepsis</ENAMEX> may be unable to complete a QoL measure or it may
          be too burdensome. Rather than lose information on
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician investigator</ENAMEX> was used as a proxy
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">respondent</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> instruments were used to cover the objective and
          subjective dimensions. The objective component in the
          study was measured using the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Karnofsky</ENAMEX> performance scale.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Karnofsky</ENAMEX> scale emphasizes physical performance and
          dependency; it is a descriptive, ordinal scale that
          ranges from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">100</NUMEX> (good health) to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0</NUMEX> (dead). Trial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> assigned percentages based on physical
          performance (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Karnofsky</ENAMEX> scale is designed to
          assess independent functioning and appears to have
          substantial validity as an indicator of overall physical
          status. The validity and reliability of the scale have
          been shown in several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4, 5, 6</ENAMEX>].
          The subjective component of the trial was measured
          with multiple items using a visual analog scale [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>]. A
          visual analog scale is a line with defined end-points on
          which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> indicate a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s health <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>.
          Thus, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigator</ENAMEX> placed a mark along a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> mm line
          that best described his or her assessment of the patient
          with the domain in question. There were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> domains
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). The scales ranged from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0</NUMEX> (worst health status)
          to 100 (best health status). The visual analog scale has
          been used in several studies of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QoL</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8, 9, 10</ENAMEX>].
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reliability</ENAMEX> estimates for visual analog scaling items
          range from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.40</NUMEX> to 0.95 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>], and these estimates
          compare favorably with those for other scales [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>].
          The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> domains of the first visual analog scale and
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Karnofsky</ENAMEX> score are hereafter referred to as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'attributes'</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          The clinical trial
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KyberSept</ENAMEX> trial was a large, international, phase
          III clinical trial that enrolled <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2314</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who were
          evaluable for efficacy and safety in a randomized,
          double-blind, placebo-controlled design in order to
          determine the role of high-dose AT III in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
          severe <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients randomly</ENAMEX> assigned to the AT III
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> received a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30,000</NUMEX> IU plasma-derived ATIII
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kybernin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P ®</ENAMEX>) administered as a loading dose of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6000</TIMEX> IU
          given over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> min, followed by a continuous infusion of
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6000</TIMEX> IU/day for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4 days</TIMEX>. The study protocol permitted
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> to prescribe unfractionated or
          low-molecular-weight heparin for venous thrombosis
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">prophylaxis (≤ 10,000 IU/day subcutaneous</ENAMEX>) and heparin
          flushes for vascular catheter <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">potency (≤ 2 IU/kg body</ENAMEX>
          weight <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">per hour</NUMEX> intravenous).
          In the trial, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all</NUMEX>-cause mortality rate at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28 days</TIMEX>
          was almost identical between the placebo <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> and the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> that received AT III (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">38.7%</NUMEX> versus <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">39.9%</NUMEX>; not
          significant). At the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">90-day</TIMEX> time point, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT III</ENAMEX> group
          had a nominally lower mortality than did the placebo
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">46.4%</NUMEX> versus <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">48.5%</NUMEX>). Among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">680</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in the
          trial who did not receive heparin concomitantly, there
          was a statistically significant difference between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">III</ENAMEX> and placebo <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. In this subgroup, mortality at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">90</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> in the AT III <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subgroup</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">44.9%</NUMEX>, versus <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">52.5%</NUMEX> in
          the placebo subgroup ( 
          P 
          nominal = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.03</NUMEX>). A complete
          description of that study and results are reported
          elsewhere [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>].
        
        
          Outcomes
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Karnofsky</ENAMEX> scale and visual analog scales were both
          administered by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician investigators</ENAMEX> when patients
          enrolled in the trial (referred to as 'baseline'); during
          the trial at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28 days</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">56 days</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">90 days</TIMEX> after
          enrollment; and at discharge from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> (if it
          occurred other than at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of those <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> intervals). For
          example, if a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> survived and was discharged at
          day60, there would be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> assessments (i.e. baseline and
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days 28, 56</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX>). The primary outcome was change in
          attribute scores until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">90 days</TIMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were
          assigned to either treatment or placebo. For this
          analysis, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient populations</ENAMEX> were used. The smaller
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">population</ENAMEX> was the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> remaining in the hospital <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">90</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> from baseline - the 'in-hospital <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">survivors</ENAMEX>'. The
          larger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> comprised all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">survivors</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">90 days</TIMEX>, or
          at the time point closest to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">90 days</TIMEX>. This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> is
          labeled the 'all-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">survivors</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. It includes the
          in-hospital <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. In cases in which there was no patient
          response at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">90 days</TIMEX> because they had been discharged, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> from the last assessment but before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">90 days</TIMEX> were
          used. This method is equivalent to using the last
          observation carried forward.
          The last observation carried forward method uses the
          last observed value for that case, and it therefore
          assumes that the outcome remains constant at the last
          observed value after discharge. Otherwise stated, it is
          assumed that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QoL</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> is stable on average
          for the short time period between discharge and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">90 days</TIMEX>.
          It is not possible to conclude firmly that the change in
          QoL between discharge and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">90 days</TIMEX> was small and unbiased.
          However, the fact that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> discharge curve
          between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT III</ENAMEX> and placebo was almost identical provides
          evidence that the comparison between treatment groups
          should be unbiased. Moreover, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician investigator</ENAMEX>,
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> were blinded to the treatment
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">assignment</ENAMEX> (placebo versus AT <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">III</ENAMEX>) throughout the
          duration of the clinical trial.
          The secondary outcome was change in the attribute
          scores at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28, 56</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">90 days</TIMEX> after assignment to
          treatment or placebo. That outcome measure was used in
          order to compare relative changes between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT III</ENAMEX> and
          placebo <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> at the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28-day</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">56-day</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">90-day</TIMEX>
          assessments.
        
        
          Analysis
          
            Patient characteristics
            Mean, standard deviation, and range values (for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX>)
            and percentages for relevant patient characteristics
            (at enrollment and administration of heparin) are
            reported. The overall trial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> is presented, as
            well as the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">survivors</ENAMEX> and the in-hospital <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">survivors</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. The other variables used were <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simplified Acute</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Physiology Score</ENAMEX> (SAPS) <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>] (a measure of severity
            of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX>), admitting diagnosis, and concomitant use
            of heparin. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SAPS II</ENAMEX> system, a score-to-risk
            transformation developed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Le Gall</ENAMEX> 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>] for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>
            was used. The risk intervals were identical to the SAPS
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> strata defined in the trial.
          
          
            Changes in quality of life between baseline and
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">90 days</TIMEX>
            For both the in-hospital <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">survivors</ENAMEX> and the
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">survivors groups</ENAMEX>, mean changes and standard
            deviations between baseline and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">90 days</TIMEX> are shown.
            Differences in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">QoL</ENAMEX> between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT III</ENAMEX> and placebo were
            estimated for each attribute. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX>-sample Wilcoxon
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">statistical</ENAMEX> tests were used to determine whether the
            changes were different between treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>.
          
          
            Differences among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient subgroups</ENAMEX>
            Similarly, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wilcoxon</ENAMEX> tests were used to identify
            whether changes in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QoL</ENAMEX> scores differed for
            subgroups between baseline and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">90 days</TIMEX>. This analysis
            was done on the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">survivors population</ENAMEX>.
          
          
            Changes in quality of life between baseline and
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28, 56</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">90 days</TIMEX>
            For the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">survivors</ENAMEX> and in-hospital <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">survivors</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">subgroups</ENAMEX>, comparative differences in changes between
            baseline and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28, 56</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">90 days</TIMEX> were estimated. For
            each attribute, the difference in mean change between
            treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> is presented, together with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-sided
            <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> confidence intervals, so that the differences
            between placebo and AT III over time are clearly
            shown.
          
          
            Statistical considerations
            Nominal 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> values should be regarded as
            descriptive because no formal null hypothesis was
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prespecified</ENAMEX> and no type I error probability can be
            indicated. No adjustment of 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> values for multiple testing or
            multiple confidence intervals was made. 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> values less than or equal to
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX> were considered statistically significant. 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> values above <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX> but less than
            or equal to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.10</NUMEX> were considered indicative of a trend.
            Confidence intervals for the difference between mean
            changes were constructed assuming a normal distribution
            of changes from baseline.

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">heparin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2314</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who entered
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KyberSept</ENAMEX> trial. The all-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">survivors group</ENAMEX> using the
          last observation carried forward analysis totaled <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">897</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, whereas the in-hospital <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> totaled <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">118</NUMEX>. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> included in this study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> were from a
          broad mixture of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX>.
          The mean ± SD age of the overall <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">58</NUMEX> ±
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17 years</TIMEX> in the placebo <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">57</NUMEX> ± <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17 years</TIMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">III</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. Mean age was lower (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">53</NUMEX> ± <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17 years</TIMEX>) in the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">survivors population</ENAMEX>. A clear majority of patients
          were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">61.5%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> versus <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">38.5%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>). In the three
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">populations</ENAMEX> (overall, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">all 90 day</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">survivors</ENAMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">90 day</TIMEX>
          in-hospital <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">survivors</ENAMEX>), the sex distribution for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT</ENAMEX>
          III <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> was similar. There was a shift toward the
          lower risk strata of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAPS</ENAMEX> II score from the overall
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">survivors population</ENAMEX>, whereas the
          risks in the in-hospital <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> were slightly higher
          than those in the overall <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. In the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">survivors group</ENAMEX> respiratory disorders were the most
          common diagnostic admitting category, whereas digestive
          causes of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX> were the most common among the
          in-hospital <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>.
          Among all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> enrolled in the trial, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70%</NUMEX> received
          heparin concomitantly. Among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">survivors</ENAMEX>, placebo
          and AT III differed by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3%</NUMEX> with respect to concomitant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">heparin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>. In this population <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">71%</NUMEX> of placebo
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were administered heparin concomitantly; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">68%</NUMEX> of
          those administered AT III received heparin. Among the
          in-hospital <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">survivors</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">90 days</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">87%</NUMEX> in the placebo
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> received heparin as compared with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70%</NUMEX> of those
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">receiving AT III</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Comparing</ENAMEX> AT III <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> across
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">populations</ENAMEX>, the use of concomitant heparin was nearly
          the same.
        
        
          Changes in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">90-day</TIMEX> quality of life
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4shows</ENAMEX> data for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> attributes of the visual
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">analog</ENAMEX> scale and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Karnofsky</ENAMEX> scale (objective physical
          performance and dependency) measured from baseline to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">90</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>. Assessment of the changes among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">survivors</ENAMEX>,
          based on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-sided, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-sample <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wilcoxon</ENAMEX> tests, suggests
          advantages for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT III</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> as compared with the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">placebo</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of the attributes; namely, patient
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">communication</ENAMEX> and speech, level of alertness, and energy
          level. In the inhospital <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, the differences
          indicated that communication and speech, level of
          alertness, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Karnofsky</ENAMEX> scale were all more improved
          for the AT III <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> than for placebo.
          In neither <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> was the change in patient
          overall QoL judged to be statistically different. In the
          in-hospital <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, a trend toward greater patient energy
          levels in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT III</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> was found ( 
          P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.10</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Differences across patient <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subgroups</ENAMEX>
          As shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5</ENAMEX>, although there were generally
          greater increases in attribute scores in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAPS</ENAMEX> II risk
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT III</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">survivors</ENAMEX>, none of the differences
          were statistically significant. There were also no
          significant differences between placebo and AT III
          according to the diagnostic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subgroups</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>
          admission, although a few 'trends' favoring AT III
          (notably the 'energy level' attribute of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QoL</ENAMEX>) were found.
          In the heparin <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subgroups</ENAMEX>, there was an advantage in some
          attributes for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT III</ENAMEX>. Compared with placebo, physical
          activity was improved significantly more in the AT III
          subgroup than in the placebo subgroup not receiving
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heparin</ENAMEX>. There was also a trend toward greater
          improvement in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> other attributes in the no
          concomitant heparin subgroup, namely <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> mobility,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">communication</ENAMEX> and speech, and patient energy level.
          Excluding the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Karnofsky</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scores</ENAMEX> that were unchanged, mean
          nominal changes in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">AT III</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">QoL</ENAMEX> attributes of the no
          concomitant heparin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> ranged from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">+4 to +9</TIMEX>, whereas
          those receiving concomitant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heparin</ENAMEX> experienced nominal
          increases in scores ranging from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">+2 to +5</NUMEX>.
        
        
          Changes in quality of life between baseline and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX>,

          in-hospital <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. Considering point estimates of
          differences between mean changes at each time point, for
          all attributes and in both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> AT III patients
          were more improved than placebo <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. Confidence
          intervals fully occupying the 'AT III better' side
          indicate statistically significant improvements in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">III</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. In the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">survivors population</ENAMEX>, comparative
          improvements tended to increase over time in the AT III
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> as compared with the placebo <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. An exception
          was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Karnofsky</ENAMEX> index, for which the difference between
          treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> remained approximately constant over
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>. For the in-hospital <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, the advantage in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT III</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> increased over time for the
          communication/speech and the level of alertness
          attributes, whereas the difference between treatment
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">groups</ENAMEX> remained approximately constant for the other
          attributes. In the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">survivors</ENAMEX>, the greatest
          comparative advantages for the AT III <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> were found in
          communication/speech, alertness, and energy level.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        The present study represents the first attempt to
        evaluate patient <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QoL</ENAMEX> over a relatively long period in a
        large, randomized, placebo-controlled <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX> trial. The
        results of the study indicate that, over a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">90-day</TIMEX> period,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">survivors</ENAMEX> of severe <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX> receiving AT III experienced
        substantial and statistically significant improvements as
        compared with placebo in several attributes of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QoL</ENAMEX>. These
        results held for both all-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">survivors</ENAMEX> and in-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">survivors populations</ENAMEX>. The comparative advantage in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">QoL</ENAMEX> for
        AT III was also maintained from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28 to 56</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">90 days</TIMEX>.
        After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">90 days</TIMEX>, the study also found an advantage with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">III</ENAMEX> for some attributes in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who did not receive
        heparin concomitantly.
        The improvements identified in the study should be
        interpreted in terms of statistical and clinical
        significance. Clinical significance deals with the applied
        value of the change in everyday life. Unfortunately, as
        with most other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QoL</ENAMEX> instruments, there is not yet a clear
        standard for 'minimal clinically important differences'.
        However, improvements by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 20%</NUMEX> in the
        in-hospital <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of AT III <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">90 days</TIMEX>
        in communication/speech and level of alertness probably
        represent meaningful improvements in many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
        Another limitation of the present study is the fact that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> were proxy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX>, rather than patients
        responding themselves. Like many studies of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QoL</ENAMEX> in critical
        care settings, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> were assumed to be sufficiently
        close to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> to provide valid and reliable data.
        Although this was not substantiated empirically, there is
        usually moderate agreement between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and proxies,
        although lower levels of agreement have been found in
        psychosocial functioning [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17, 18</TIMEX>].
      
      
        Conclusion
        Combined with previous findings in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">90-day</TIMEX> mortality for
        those without concomitant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> of heparin, this
        multinational study demonstrates that AT III is associated
        with meaningful improvements in health for many <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> over an extended <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3-month</TIMEX> follow-up period. In this
        subgroup, the clinical improvements over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a long time</TIMEX> period
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in the AT III <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> were complemented by
        improvements in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">QoL</ENAMEX> in many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, particularly in terms
        of social and psychologic functioning. Although no
        significant reduction in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">90-day</TIMEX> mortality was found for the
        overall <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, a nominal advantage in mortality for
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT III</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> combined with a generally improved QoL
        profile in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">survivors</ENAMEX> of this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> suggests a possible
        long-term benefit from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AT III</ENAMEX>. Future studies of critically
        ill <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with severe <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX> or other conditions should
        include long-term follow up of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> throughout
        hospitalization and after hospital discharge. In <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX>,
        long-term follow up appears to provide more meaningful
        outcome data for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>, and society than do
        standard <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28-day</TIMEX>, all-cause mortality statistics.
      
      
        Key messages
        · In the present study, clinical improvements over an
        extended time period with AT III were complemented by
        improvements in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">QoL</ENAMEX>, particularly in social andpsychologic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">functioning</ENAMEX>, in a predefined subgroup of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who did
        not receive heparin.
