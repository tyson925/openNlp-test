        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Grain</ENAMEX> filling aspects of nutrient partitioning are
        intensely studied as they affect the yield and quality of
        many important <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cereals</ENAMEX>. This quality can be measured in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nutritional</ENAMEX> and aesthetic terms. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grain</ENAMEX>-filling process
        of cereal development typically has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> processes: dilatory
        and filling. Together these processes encompass the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">synthesis</ENAMEX>, transport, and storage of carbohydrates, fatty
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">acids</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, and minerals. The dilatory process is
        characterized by high biosynthetic activity and low dry
        matter accumulation. During the filling phase all plant
        resources contribute toward a steady rate of starch
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accumulation</ENAMEX> in the starch storage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX>. Genes that
        influence the grain filling process are particularly
        important in achieving the goal of manipulating nutrient
        partitioning pathways.
        In <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhu</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] , several genes
        responsible for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grain</ENAMEX> filling in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX> were computationally
        identified. There, clustering of gene expression profiles
        was used to identify grain filling genes and their
        transcription factors from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice genes</ENAMEX>. The method
        used consisted of an initial identification of nutrient
        partitioning <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> based on annotation and selection of
        genes that potentially participate in the grain-filling
        process by clustering of expression profiles via
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Self-Organizing Map</ENAMEX> (SOM), followed by hierarchical
        clustering influenced by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SOM</ENAMEX> gene ordering [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . A
        set of grain filling related, nutrient partitioning gene
        clusters were identified via informed visual inspection of
        the hierarchical clustering results. This initial set of
        genes formed the sole basis for identification of a wider
        range of grain filling related genes with diverse
        functions, over-represented 
        cis acting regulatory elements, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> transcription factors. Such an approach provided
        a powerful way to associate genes with traits of interest,
        to identify key <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> as putative target genes in this
        complicated biological process, and a potential method to
        identify strategies for improvement of crop yield and
        nutrient value by pathway engineering. However, the
        identified genes and their regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> require
        thorough functional validations by experimental methods
        such as reverse genetics. These experimental validation
        steps usually are time-consuming and expensive. Thus,
        improvement of microarray data analysis by false positive
        reduction becomes necessary.
        Competitive learning schemes like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kohonen SOM</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ]
        and hierarchical clustering are popular methods for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">visualization</ENAMEX> and identification of patterns in a large set
        of gene expression profiles. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SOM</ENAMEX> analysis can provide
        nonexclusive classifications, but requires an estimate for
        the number of classes (nodes) and is usually carried out in
        a low-dimensional <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">space</ENAMEX>. Hierarchical clustering is a more
        frequently used method, but visualization via
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">one-dimensional</ENAMEX> lists can lead to poor resolution of
        related genes even if a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SOM</ENAMEX> gene ordering influences the
        branch flipping, as implemented in the software tool
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cluster</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] .
        Recently, singular value decomposition (SVD) has emerged
        as an alternative method for genomic research. Several
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> have demonstrated its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX> in identifying global,
        cyclic patterns of gene expression [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5</NUMEX> ] , and its
        application in reduction of experimental and biological
        noise in microarray datasets [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SVD</ENAMEX> is a feature
        generation technique that facilitates the exploration of
        multiple dimensions of data variability. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SVD</ENAMEX> is an
        operation applied to a matrix that results in a list of
        vectors, which contain features measuring different aspects
        of variation in the data. One can produce multiple
        nonexclusive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene orderings</ENAMEX> or classifications based on
        significant feature vectors. The patterns exhibited by one
        or more feature vectors, singly or in combination, may
        correspond to biological processes.
        To improve accuracy of target identification by avoiding
        
        exclusive clustering and exploring a
        wider range of dimensionality in expression pattern
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">variation</ENAMEX>, we have examined the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX> of singular value
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">decomposition</ENAMEX> in identifying <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grain</ENAMEX>-filling genes. In this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">manuscript</ENAMEX>, we focus on nutrient partitioning genes
        potentially involved in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grain</ENAMEX> filling. After evaluating the
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">full</TIMEX> spectrum of expression patterns, we address the
        identification of grain filling genes by a measure of
        correlation with a familiar expression pattern,
        conceptually conforming to grain filling. In this manner we
        have identified several genes potentially involved in grain
        filling, and evaluate them by comparison with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grain</ENAMEX> filling
        genes identified in an earlier study [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . These genes
        have similar expression profiles showing significant
        differential expression during <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice grain</ENAMEX> development and
        tissue specificity to panicle and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grain</ENAMEX>. 
        Cis -acting regulatory element
        surveys also support their role in the grain filling
        process.
      
      
        Results
        The decomposition of a matrix of expression levels, 
        A , presented us with several
        interesting patterns for gene expression during grain
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> patterns are
        significant according to the relative variance threshold, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> , described by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Everitt</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dunn</ENAMEX>
        (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2001</TIMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.7/</NUMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">491</NUMEX> â†’ 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.00142</NUMEX>.) The entropy in the
        distribution of relative variances is very low, indicating
        uneven contribution of the patterns to the expression
        profiles in 
        A (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). The first pattern, 
        v 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> , reflects a significant deviation
        from the basal expression level, with an insignificant
        variance between experimental conditions. In addition, the
        coefficients of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">u</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> have higher entropy of distribution
        than the following left singular vectors, making it a
        weaker gene classifier. 
        v 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> may represent normalized global gene
        expression deviation from the project mean, and was not
        used to identify <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grain</ENAMEX>-filling genes. 
        v 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2</ENAMEX> has a significant pattern of variation
        between experiments, indicative of a process very similar
        to our <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grain</ENAMEX>-filling ideal. 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">u</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> was used to sort the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">491</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. The
        sorted expression profiles are shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. We
        classified genes as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grain</ENAMEX> filling if their rank percentile
        was greater than or equal to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.8</NUMEX>. We limited our threshold
        to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.8</NUMEX> in order to obtain a set of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 98</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> set was a list of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">98</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> previously classified as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grain</ENAMEX> filling by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhu</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . Thus, the
        maximum possible fraction of overlap between our grain
        filling gene list and the control <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">set</ENAMEX> could be <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX>.
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Seventy</TIMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> percent of the control set had rank percentiles
        greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.8</NUMEX>. There were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> ranked above this
        level that were not in the control set (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1a</ENAMEX>). The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> set percentiles are shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX> (see
        Additional file: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>), with values derived from rankings by
        several patterns. Those in the control set not greater than
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</NUMEX> thpercentile in the 
        v 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ranking were investigated further to
        see if they followed other potential nutrient partitioning
        patterns. Of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these twenty</TIMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> were strongly
        composed of pattern 
        v 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> , and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> of 
        v 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> , leaving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">thirteen genes</ENAMEX> in the grain
        filling control set unaccounted for (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1b</ENAMEX>).

        The selection of grain filling genes by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SVD</ENAMEX> pattern
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX>, when compared to visual selection relying on
        clustering, returns genes with expression profiles more
        consistent with our <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grain</ENAMEX>-filling ideal. The expression
        profiles for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in the control set found by one pattern
        or another were averaged (Class A). A similar treatment was
        given to those not found (Class B), and separately, those
        not in the control set but highly ranked by 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">u</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (Class C). Classes A, B, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C</ENAMEX> were
        plotted together to compare their expression profiles,
        Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Class B</ENAMEX> shows little differential expression when
        compared with C and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A.</ENAMEX> A shows differential expression that
        corresponds with our ideal for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grain</ENAMEX> filling expression
        profiles. Class C also shows <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grain</ENAMEX>-filling-like
        differential expression, but with lower magnitude of
        variation.
        The detailed classification of the grain filling related
        nutrient <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">partitioning genes</ENAMEX> was examined and compared
        between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> studies. It is clear that the previously
        selected grain-filling genes in our control set comprised
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> different gene clusters (Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). In <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>
        (see Additional file: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) the genes are ordered according to
        that in the clustering. Among them, ninety-two percent of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in cluster node <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">439</NUMEX> were classified by 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">u</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grain</ENAMEX> filling genes, while the
        other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> clusters had <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 42%</NUMEX> of their genes
        classified as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grain</ENAMEX> filling genes. These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> clusters
        differ from the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> in purity of signal. The three
        clusters with fewer matches seem to exhibit a mixture of
        expression patterns, while the first cluster does so to a
        much lower extent.
        The involvement in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grain</ENAMEX> filling of the novel set (C) of
        genes is supported by the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-representation of the grain
        filling 
        cis -element. A survey of 
        cis elements of the C set of genes
        shows that they have more in common with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grain</ENAMEX> filling
        genes than the unselected <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. The element <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AACA</ENAMEX> was found
        to be over represented among grain-filling genes in earlier
        work by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhu</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX> , and is more abundant among
        the novel genes. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AACA</ENAMEX> was part of the motif <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAACA</ENAMEX>, which
        occurred in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX>. This motif was
        described as the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">RAV1</NUMEX> AAT binding consensus sequence of 
        Arabidopsis thaliana transcription
        factor, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RAV1</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AACA</ENAMEX> was also found in an <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">E4-TATA Box</ENAMEX>
        element contained in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . Looking
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AACA</ENAMEX> in the set of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">unselected genes</ENAMEX>, it was found in
        the motif <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAACAAA</ENAMEX>, which only occurred in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX>. This motif was described as a binding site for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAMYB</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . Considering the similarities in expression
        pattern and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter elements</ENAMEX> between the novel genes and
        the previously identified grain filling genes, the novel
        set of genes is likely to be involved in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grain</ENAMEX> filling as
        well.
        To characterize the function of genes that were
        classified differently by each method (Class B), we
        analyzed their expression patterns in the vegetative growth
        phase and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter sequences</ENAMEX>. Among the vegetative
        growth <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX>, this set of genes is generally expressed at
        a higher level than either the novel set (Class C) or the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grain</ENAMEX> filling set (Class A) - both of which have very
        similar un-normalized expression levels. Figure
        7illustrates <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the un-normalized</TIMEX> average expression levels
        for each set. Closer inspection of the differences between
        expression levels of these genes in the vegetative growth
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">samples</ENAMEX> reveals a slight elevation in expression for
        non-photosynthetic samples, including all root samples, and
        senescence stem and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">senescence leaf samples</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>). A 
        cis element unique to this set of
        genes is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AACCAA</ENAMEX>, and may explain this bias. It was found in
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> from this set, but was not present
        among the other genes with a grain-filling pattern. This
        light-repressed promoter element was previously found to
        have higher DNA binding activity in etiolated <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> but
        much lower activity in green <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] .
      
      
        Discussion
        Our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of genes to singular vectors was not
        exclusive. A gene's expression profile can be described as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">linear</ENAMEX> combination of each right singular vector, and said
        gene can be associated with those vectors that contribute
        the most. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clustering</ENAMEX> provides nested clusters with mutual
        exclusivity among clusters at a given correlation
        threshold. When there are genes with low intensity
        patterns, clustering can result in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> with a mixture of
        patterns and low internal correlation. Sets of genes
        strongly correlated with a particular singular vector will
        have greater internal correlation. Given these differences,
        both methods agree on a majority of grain filling genes,
        which had very significant differential expression during
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">grain development</ENAMEX>. This could be expected as both
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clustering</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SVD</ENAMEX> seek to minimize the squared error.
        The area of disagreement between methods concerned genes
        with low differential expression. They were listed as grain
        filling in the control set but were not selected with the
        SVD method. These unselected genes are not any less
        important than those identified with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SVD</ENAMEX>, they simply
        exhibit small changes in expression level during grain
        filling - changes that may be insignificant due to the
        presence of errors. In many cases regulatory genes have
        small changes in expression level, while target genes
        further along in the cascade have larger changes. The
        increased sensitivity of pattern detection will improve our
        ability to extract these target genes before using them to
        search for regulatory genes with other methods. Almost all
        of these genes with a weak grain-filling pattern were
        originally part of hierarchical clustering nodes with very
        low internal correlation (average pair-wise correlation). A
        more stringent classification that excluded such nodes
        would have resulted in a more concordant set of gene
        expression profiles.
        The unselected set might be misclassified in the earlier
        study [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] , possibly carrying out roles important in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grain</ENAMEX> filling process but sites physically distant from the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grain</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> itself. Their expression profiles did not follow
        a pattern similar to that of known grain filling genes, and
        during vegetative growth, their expression levels are
        consistently higher. These genes, in general, lacked
        promoter elements common to grain filling genes. They also
        had conserved promoter elements that were not found in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grain filling genes</ENAMEX>. If functional in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX>, their light
        repressed elements would explain the higher expression in
        root, which grows in dark conditions. It is possible that
        the higher expression levels observed during stem and leaf
        senescence are due to suppression of photosynthesis
        activity. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rice</ENAMEX> is a monocot <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> and there are portions of
        stem that are etiolated due to blockage of light from
        permanent leaf encirclement. During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">senescence</TIMEX>, the light
        sensitivity of stem and leaf is biochemically reduced. This
        may result in a 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de</ENAMEX> facto etiolated <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> also
        explaining the elevated gene expression. The
        misclassification of these genes was due to the combined
        effects of including nodes with low internal correlation
        and information loss from hierarchical clustering. It
        should also be noted that compared to the set of novel
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and the set of agreed-upon genes, a greater fraction,
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.3</NUMEX> vs. <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.107 & 0.115</NUMEX> respectively, of these unselected
        genes have potentially unreliable <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe sets</ENAMEX>. This
        unreliability stems from the inability to compile a full
        set of unique probes for these genes, and is indicated by
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Probe Set ID</ENAMEX> suffixes 'r' and 'i', indicating sequences
        for which it was not possible to pick a full set of unique
        probes or for which there are fewer than fifteen
        probes.
        When using hierarchical clustering to classify gene
        expression profiles, there are several drawbacks to
        consider. Generally, microarray data is information-rich,
        with multiple dimensions of variability. The ordering of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> produced by hierarchical clustering reduces this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variability</ENAMEX> to a single dimension, which may not accurately
        reflect the differences between expression profiles. As a
        result, closeness in this single dimension may not reflect
        similarities occurring in a higher dimensional space. These
        factors impact difficult-to-classify profiles more
        significantly. In <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhu</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2003</TIMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] this lead to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grain-filling genes</ENAMEX>, with less obvious expression profiles,
        being grouped with a mixture of other profiles, resulting
        in the selection of unreliable patterns over better
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX>. The SOM ordering used to influence the
        hierarchical clustering ordering helped with this problem,
        but there are other ways to improve classification
        accuracy. To avoid these pitfalls, a more stringent
        selection criterion could have been used with the
        hierarchical clustering results to build a core set,
        followed by a profile ranking based on correlation with the
        core set. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> round of selection would help to
        recover profiles with a weaker pattern, which would have
        been randomly ordered by hierarchical clustering. Another
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> to avoid these pitfalls would be to take advantage of
        the many "fuzzy" clustering algorithms, which generate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">non-exclusive</ENAMEX> assignment of genes to clusters [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13</NUMEX> ]
        .
        While exploring this use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SVD</ENAMEX>, there were a few
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">caveats</ENAMEX> learned which concern the contribution of noise to
        the pattern spectrum. The matrix that is decomposed by SVD
        is usually a dissimilarity matrix like the covariance
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">matrix</ENAMEX>. The singular values, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">w</ENAMEX> 
        
          i 
         , are typically used to indicate the significance of
        each right singular vector to the dataset. The first 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> vectors that cumulatively account
        for greater than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">dataset</ENAMEX>'s variation are
        sometimes used to describe the dataset and reduce its
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dimensionality</ENAMEX>. The rest of the right singular vectors are
        then considered noise. This interpretation is not always
        correct and should be tempered by a study of the right
        singular vectors themselves. In the situation where the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dataset</ENAMEX> contains significant additive noise or where the
        means are not centered, the previous assumption could
        result in one ignoring informative patterns exhibited by
        the right singular vectors with relatively low singular
        values. The primary signal would represent this noise
        (unconformable pattern) and mask the other patterns. An
        observation of the primary right singular vector's pattern
        would indicate a relatively constant level for all samples,
        poorly <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">classifying</ENAMEX> experiments or correlating with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentially</ENAMEX> expressed genes. Although possible, there
        was no need to filter out strong noise from the dataset and
        recalculate the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SVD</ENAMEX>. This condition was dealt with by
        focusing on right singular vectors that correlate with our
        conceptual <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grain</ENAMEX>-filling pattern, regardless of their
        singular value's magnitude. These "grain filling" right
        singular vectors were then used to classify the genes in
        our dataset. In fact, a classification of genes using the
        right singular vector with the largest singular value was
        of low quality.
        As the coefficients for each right singular vector are
        used to classify genes and the genes in each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> should
        ideally have coefficients different from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in other
        classes, the challenge to identify a vector that produces a
        good classification can be simplified by measurement of the
        entropy for each vector's coefficient distribution. Vectors
        with the lowest entropy, even if they have a small singular
        value, have the most ordered coefficient distribution and
        may be quite useful in classifying <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> into distinct
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. We will follow up on this idea in future
        applications of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SVD</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA dynamics</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SVD</ENAMEX> can be used to reduce the dimensionality of a data
        set, but our method uses the singular vectors generated by
        the decomposition to identify patterns that may relate to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grain</ENAMEX> filling in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX>. In this way, we attempt to avoid
        overlooking any dimensions of expression profile variance.
        A gene ranking based on similarity to interesting
        feature-vectors allows recovery of profiles with weaker but
        relevant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grain</ENAMEX> filling patterns. This method selected genes
        with greater differential expression than the questionable
        set presented by clustering. The newly identified genes are
        important because they represent genes that have a stronger
        pattern of grain filling, which were not easily visually
        identified from the hierarchical clustering. It is likely
        that if the previous method only relied on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SOM</ENAMEX>, more of
        these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> would have been identified. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SVD</ENAMEX> provides much
        information about patterns of variability in a dataset
        rather than a rigid assignment of genes to clusters. This
        added perspective, plus the ability to amplify or attenuate
        specific patterns in the dataset, complements the
        classifications given by commonly used clustering
        techniques.
      
      
        Conclusions
        We conclude that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SVD</ENAMEX> is a useful alternative method that
        complements widely used clustering methods for studying
        function of genes. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SVD</ENAMEX> identified grain-filling related
        genes, providing additional, valuable candidate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> for
        improving grain composition and yield.

          Based on their sequence annotation and functional

          because their products are presumably involved in or

          median-centered and normalized such that the sum of
          squares for each expression vector was equal to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>. In
          efforts to validate our results, we also investigated
          gene expression level in a wider range of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX>,

          The normalization applied to this broader set was the
          same as that described for the set of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX>, above. Note
          that the difference in sample number will affect the
          median centering and normalization steps, making smaller

          Promoter analysis

          were identified to check if pattern similarity could be
          related to conserved

          significant elements were identified with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PERL</ENAMEX> script
          and annotated with the PLACE database [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . The PERL
          script identified motifs among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter sequences</ENAMEX> for a
          given set of genes. Those elements that matched to an
          annotated 
          cis -acting regulatory DNA element
          from the PLACE database were then presented. We limited
          our investigation to elements located within <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 KB</NUMEX> of the
          transcriptional start site and that had an e-value less
          than 3E-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">02</NUMEX>. At the time of publication, not all probe
          sets could be associated with high quality assembled
