        Lymphadenectomies with routine histopathologic
        evaluation have been performed for staging and regional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> of primary cutaneous melanoma, even in cases
        without clinical evidence of metastasis. Because of
        significant morbidity associated with the procedure,
        regional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lymphadenectomy</ENAMEX> has been generally recommended
        only for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with evidence of regional lymph node
        involvement [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . To assess the involvement of regional
        lymph <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">nodes</ENAMEX>, the biopsies of sentinel lymph <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">nodes</ENAMEX> are
        invaluable for detecting occult metastases without the
        significant morbidity associated with lymphadenectomy [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5 6 7 8</NUMEX> ] . Previous studies have reported that the
        status of sentinel lymph <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">node</ENAMEX> is an accurate reflection of
        the regional lymph node status as a whole and that
        treatment decisions can be made based on the results of
        sentinel lymph <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">nodes</ENAMEX> alone [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 10 11</ENAMEX> ] .
        Previously, we had demonstrated higher diagnostic
        accuracy in detecting and diagnosing melanoma
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">micrometastases</ENAMEX> in sentinel lymph node using monoclonal
        antibodies to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MART-1</ENAMEX> (clone <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M2-7C10</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Melan-A</ENAMEX> (clone
        A103) in comparison to the traditionally used
        immunohistochemical markers, S<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-100 protein</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S-100</ENAMEX>) and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HMB-45</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . The cytoplasmic staining with these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunomarkers</ENAMEX> does not obscure the nuclear details and
        facilitates accurate interpretation of tumor cells,
        macrophages, and nevus cells in contrast to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S-100</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6 12</ENAMEX> ]
        . A monoclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a third</NUMEX> melanoma immunomarker,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tyrosinase</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">clone T311</ENAMEX>), showed an immunostaining pattern
        similar to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MART-1 and Melan-A</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] .
        In the present study, we evaluated the combination of
        monoclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MART-1</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Melan-A</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tyrosinase</ENAMEX> in
        optimized titers (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>) for evaluation of sentinel lymph
        nodes of cutaneous melanoma. We designated this combination
        after our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX> as 'MCW <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">melanoma cocktail</ENAMEX>' [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6 14</ENAMEX> ] .
        Hypothetically, due to the immunoreactivity of the cocktail
        towards <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> epitopes of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> antigens in the same tissue
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">section</ENAMEX>, combined use of these immunomarkers should
        increase the sensitivity while still maintaining their
        individual high specificity. The possibility of using a
        cocktail of these monoclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> for the evaluation
        of melanoma sentinel lymph <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">node</ENAMEX> would require <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only one</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">section</ENAMEX> as compared to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> adjacent <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX> for each of
        the immunomarker, with resultant cost savings of
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two thirds</NUMEX>.
        The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">detecting</ENAMEX> and interpreting micrometastases in the sentinel
        lymph nodes of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with cutaneous melanoma utilizing
        this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocktail</ENAMEX> in a single section instead of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> adjacent
        sections needing each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> immunomarkers in the
        cocktail. We also compared the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocktail</ENAMEX> against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MART-1</ENAMEX> and
        Melan-A individually.
      
      
        Methods
        Sentinel lymph <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">node specimens</ENAMEX> were grossed as described
        previously [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue
        sections of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">269</NUMEX> slices were evaluated with the cocktail
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). In some cases <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> lymph <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">nodes</ENAMEX> were
        submitted as sentinel lymph <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">nodes</ENAMEX>. The fresh, unfixed
        sentinel lymph <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">nodes</ENAMEX> were transected into slices no thicker
        than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> mm across the long axis from one pole to the other.
        They were fixed flat in formalin after wrapping them in
        tissue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> to avoid curling and were processed for
        paraffin embedding.
        The test group included <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">188</NUMEX> slices of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">88</NUMEX> sentinel lymph
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nodes</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 to 6 slices</NUMEX> per lymph <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">node</ENAMEX>) from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> cases (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 to 4</NUMEX>
        lymph nodes per case) of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">AJCC stage I and II</ENAMEX> cutaneous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">melanoma</ENAMEX> lacking metastases which were easily detectable in
        sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin. These lymph
        nodes were from various regions other than the axillary
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">areas</ENAMEX>. A negative test control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> was studied to verify
        the specificity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocktail</ENAMEX>. It consisted of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">81</NUMEX> slices
        of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> sentinel lymph <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">nodes</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 to 5 slices</NUMEX> per lymph <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">node</ENAMEX>)
        from the axillary area in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> cases of mammary carcinoma, of
        which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> slices were positive for mammary carcinoma
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">metastases</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
        All the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX> in the test <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> and negative control
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> were immunostained with the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocktail</ENAMEX> (the details of
        antibodies in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocktail</ENAMEX> are shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). As a
        standardization process to confirm positive
        immunoreactivity, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> melanomas (including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> spindle cell
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">melanoma</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> clear cell melanoma) were evaluated. All
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">35 melanomas</TIMEX> were immunoreactive with the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocktail</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Antibodies</ENAMEX> from a few additional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>, other than those
        mentioned in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>, were also evaluated. However, only
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> mentioned in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX> 1with
        heat <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> retrieval protocol achieved optimum results
        without significant background staining.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX> were pretreated for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> retrieval using
        'Dako pH <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">6.0</NUMEX> target retrieval solution' ®(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dako Corporation</ENAMEX>,
        Carpinteria, CA) at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">95-100°C</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">35 minutes</TIMEX> and cooled at
        room temperature for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20 minutes</TIMEX>. The target retrieval
        solution must be at a temperature of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">95-100°C</TIMEX> from the
        start. The duration of this heat antigen retrieval step was
        crucial for avoiding non-specific background staining. It
        was optimal for all the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> in the
        cocktail.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX>-micron thick serial sections of paraffin-embedded
        tissue blocks were numbered consecutively from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 to 3</NUMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Section</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#1</NUMEX> was stained with hematoxylin and eosin. <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Section</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#2</NUMEX> was immunostained with 'melanoma <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocktail</ENAMEX>' using
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diaminobenzidine Hydrochloride</ENAMEX> (DAB) as a chromogen.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Section</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#3</NUMEX> was used as a negative control without primary
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX>. A positive control consisting of a formalin-fixed
        paraffin-embedded tissue section of melanoma demonstrating
        reactivity for the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocktail</ENAMEX> was processed with each batch
        of slides. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> adjacent <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX> were immunostained with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MART-1 and Melan</ENAMEX>-A respectively during our previous study
        on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">78</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">188 slices</NUMEX> (from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> cases) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . The
        immediately adjacent unstained <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX> during the previous
        study were used. They were immunostained with the cocktail
        in this study.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pathologists</ENAMEX> interpreted all immunostained slides
        independently to determine the presence of melanoma
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">micrometastases</ENAMEX>. Whenever indicated, respective adjacent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hematoxylin</ENAMEX> and eosin stained sections and negative control
        sections were also used to facilitate the final
        interpretation.
        Statistical evaluation for degree of interobserver
        agreement was based on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Receiver Operating</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Characteristic</ENAMEX> (ROC) curve, which takes into consideration
        the non-binary spectrum of surgical pathology
        interpretation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 15 16 17 18 19</NUMEX> ] . For the generation of
        the ROC curve and to calculate the areas under the ROC
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">curves</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Az</ENAMEX> values), the spectrum of the interpretation was
        spread into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> points with negative and positive at each
        end [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] .
        A consensus binary negative or positive diagnosis was
        reached by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all five</NUMEX> pathologists in tandem under a
        multihead microscope. This was used as the final diagnosis
        for statistical analysis. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Az</ENAMEX> values by different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observers</ENAMEX>
        for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">188</NUMEX> sections were compared using non-parametric methods
        based on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mann</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whitney</ENAMEX> statistics [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS</ENAMEX>
        statistical software (The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institute</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cary</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NC</ENAMEX>) was
        implemented for this statistical analysis (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>).
      
      
        Results
        Of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">188</ENAMEX> sections immunostained with 'melanoma
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cocktail'</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41</NUMEX> sections (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8/24</NUMEX> cases) were positive for
        melanoma micrometastases (Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2A& 2B</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Az</ENAMEX> values for
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocktail</ENAMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pathologists</ENAMEX> were high and ranged
        from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.8525 to 1.000</NUMEX> (maximum possible Az value is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.000</NUMEX>)
        without statistically significant differences (p <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.0743</NUMEX>)
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>).
        In general, the micrometastases were subtle and
        difficult to detect in the hematoxylin and eosin stained
        sections alone. Depending on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observer</ENAMEX>, micrometastases
        of melanoma in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> slices were detectable in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 30-45%</NUMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hematoxylin</ENAMEX> and eosin <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX>. However, with closer
        methodical scrutiny, these micrometastases were seen
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">retrospectively</ENAMEX> in all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41</NUMEX> adjacent sections stained with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hematoxylin</ENAMEX> and eosin. All <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">81</NUMEX> sections from sentinel lymph
        nodes of mammary carcinoma in the negative test control
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) were interpreted unequivocally as negative
        for melanoma micrometastases by each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathologists</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2C</NUMEX>).
        Out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">188</NUMEX> slices, a pool of sections immunostained
        individually with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MART-1 and Melan</ENAMEX>-A during our previous
        study (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) were compared with the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocktail</ENAMEX>. Melanoma
        micrometastases were detected in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">78</NUMEX> slices
        immunostained with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MART-1 and Melan</ENAMEX>-A individually.
        However, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> slices demonstrated micrometastases with the
        cocktail. These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> slices (from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> lymph nodes of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
        cases), negative for micrometastases with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MART-1</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Melan-A</ENAMEX>, showed melanoma micrometastases predominantly as
        single cells. These micrometastases were detectable
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">retrospectively</ENAMEX> in adjacent sections stained with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hematoxylin</ENAMEX> and eosin in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all four slices</TIMEX>. Thus, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MART-1</ENAMEX> and
        Melan-A individually could not detect micrometastases in
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4/25</NUMEX>) of the slices. No sections which were negative
        for micrometastases with the cocktail demonstrated
        micrometastases with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MART-1 and Melan</ENAMEX>-A individually.
        The 'melanoma <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocktail</ENAMEX>' did not show background staining
        of non-melanocytic cells in the sentinel lymph nodes
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2and 3</NUMEX>) and demonstrated immunostaining pattern
        identical to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MART-1 and Melan-A</ENAMEX> reported previously [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] .
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">9/188</NUMEX>) slices from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">21%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5/24</NUMEX>) of the cases showed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of cohesive spindle cells which were immunoreactive
        for the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocktail</ENAMEX> in the capsule of sentinel lymph <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">nodes</ENAMEX>.
        The bland nuclear morphology of these spindle cells was
        consistent with benign capsular melanocytic nevi (Figure
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). None of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">81</NUMEX> sections of sentinel lymph nodes from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>
        cases of mammary carcinoma demonstrated benign capsular
        melanocytic nevi.
      
      
        Discussion
        At present histomorphologic examination with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunohistochemistry</ENAMEX> remains the most reliable and
        practical means of detecting melanoma micrometastases in
        sentinel lymph <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">nodes</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6 21</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MART-1 and Melan</ENAMEX>-A are two
        antibodies to different epitopes of the same <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> and
        are complementary to each other. As previously reported,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MART-1 and Melan</ENAMEX>-A demonstrated predominantly cytoplasmic
        staining of melanoma cells [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . The monoclonal antibody
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">T311</NUMEX>) to tyrosinase, has been reported to demonstrate high
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sensitivity</ENAMEX> and specificity for melanoma [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . It has
        also demonstrated an immunostaining pattern in sentinel
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lymph nodes</ENAMEX> identical to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MART-1 and Melan-A.</ENAMEX> We combined
        these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> as 'MCW <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">melanoma cocktail</ENAMEX>' (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
        In contrast to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S-100</ENAMEX>, these immunomarkers did not
        obscure nuclear details. In addition, they did not stain
        the dendritic cells which are generally prominent in the
        sentinel lymph <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">nodes</ENAMEX> after the diagnostic biopsy of a
        primary lesion. This facilitated unequivocal interpretation
        of singly scattered melanoma cells which were otherwise
        impossible to identify in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections immunostained</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S-100</ENAMEX>
        due to high noise to signal ratio resulting from numerous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S-100</ENAMEX> immunoreactive dendritic cells in the background.
        Thus, a highly sensitive immunomarker such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S-100</ENAMEX> is less
        effective for interpretation of sentinel lymph nodes for
        melanoma micrometastases (especially when present as single
        cells) than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MART-1 and Melan-A</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . Certain
        morphological features help to differentiate melanoma cells
        and other non-melanoma cells such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">S100</ENAMEX> immunoreactive
        dendritic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> in sentinel lymph <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">nodes</ENAMEX>. However, as
        demonstrated in our previous study, it is not uncommon to
        face an equivocal situation when S<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-100 protein</ENAMEX> is used as
        an immunomarker for the interpretation of single melanoma
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">micrometastases</ENAMEX> in sentinel lymph <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">nodes</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . Based on
        our previous study with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HMB45</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] and an initial study
        with micropthalmia transcription factor [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] , these
        immunomarkers were not considered suitable for inclusion in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocktail</ENAMEX> due to the immunoreactivity of non-melanoma
        cells in the sentinel lymph <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">nodes</ENAMEX>.
        During further evaluation, we confirmed that the single
        cells immunostained with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HMB45</TIMEX> were mast cells and not
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">melanophages</ENAMEX>. Although not reported in the literature, mast
        cells in mastocytosis and reactive mast cells in desmoid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tumors</ENAMEX> also showed immunoreactivity for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HMB45</TIMEX> with granular
        cytoplasmic immunostaining pattern. The same <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> in the
        immediately adjacent section were confirmed as mast <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> by
        CD117 (personal experience). Lack of similar staining in
        the negative control sections excludes their non-specific
        nature. Mast <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> are relatively frequent in sentinel
        lymph <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">nodes</ENAMEX>, likely secondary to the previous biopsy in the
        draining field (personal experience). Occasionaly these
        cells may present an interpretation challenge, but they can
        usually be interpreted as benign [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . To avoid this
        interference by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HMB45</TIMEX> and its lower sensitivity in general,
        HMB45 was not incorporated in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocktail</ENAMEX>.
        Out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">188</NUMEX> sections immunostained with the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocktail</ENAMEX> and
        interpreted by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all five</NUMEX> pathologists collectively, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41</NUMEX> were
        positive for melanoma micrometastases (Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2Aand 2B</ENAMEX>). Az
        values amongst the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> pathologists interpreting these
        sections independently did not show statistically
        significant differences, demonstrating excellent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interobserver</ENAMEX> agreement with the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocktail</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). None
        of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">81</NUMEX> sections of mammary carcinoma sentinel lymph
        nodes showed immunoreactivity for the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocktail</ENAMEX> in any of
        the non-melanoma cells (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2C</NUMEX>) and were interpreted as
        negative for melanoma micrometastases by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all five</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observers</ENAMEX>.
        The cocktail showed favorable detection rate for
        melanoma micrometastases as compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MART-1 and Melan</ENAMEX>-A
        alone. Of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">78</NUMEX> sections, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> sections were positive for
        melanoma micrometastases with the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocktail</ENAMEX>. However, only
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> were positive with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MART-1 and Melan</ENAMEX>-A individually.
        Thus, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MART-1 and Melan</ENAMEX>-A could not individually detect
        melanoma micrometastases in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4/25</NUMEX>) of slices that were
        positive for melanoma micrometastases with the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocktail</ENAMEX>. As
        expected, combining a monoclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> to tyrosinase
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MART-1 and Melan</ENAMEX>-A in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocktail</ENAMEX> increased the
        spectrum to encompass <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> epitopes of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> melanoma
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antigens</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MART-1/Melan-A</ENAMEX> and tyrosinase). If indicated in
        the future, additional monoclonal antibodies showing
        immunostaining patterns in sentinel lymph <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">nodes</ENAMEX> that are
        similar to these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> which also posess high
        specificity for melanoma may be added to this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocktail</ENAMEX>, by
        widening the spectrum for many melanoma specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epitopes</ENAMEX>. However, care should be taken to not include any
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> that may immunostain other non-melanoma cells in
        the sentinel lymph <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">nodes</ENAMEX>. Otherwise, such <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> may
        contribute to the deterioration in the specificity of the
        cocktail compromising its application for evaluation of the
        sentinel lymph nodes of melanoma.
        During the standardization, all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> melanomas (including
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> spindle <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell melanoma</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> clear cell melanoma) were
        immunoreactive with 'the cocktail'. Non-immunoreactivity of
        special <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">variants</ENAMEX> of melanoma to various melanoma
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunomarkers</ENAMEX> is a challenge. During interpretation of
        sentinel lymph <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">nodes</ENAMEX>, the diagnosis of melanoma is known
        and the aim is to detect the melanoma micrometastases of
        the known primary. If the sentinel lymph nodes of special
        variants of melanoma are negative by 'the cocktail', it
        would be prudent to confirm the immunoreactivity of the
        primary lesion for 'the cocktail'. If the primary melanoma
        is non-immunoreactive for 'the cocktail', the negative
        interpretation of the sentinel lymph nodes with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocktail</ENAMEX> in
        this situation may be confirmed with other suitable
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunomarker</ENAMEX> to which the primary melanoma is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunoreactive</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocktail</ENAMEX> was not compared with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S-100</ENAMEX> in
        this study, as its role in evaluation of sentinel lymph
        nodes of melanoma was already demonstrated to be unreliable
        even in comparison to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MART-1 and Melan</ENAMEX>-A individually in
        the previous study [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . We did not compare tyrosinase
        alone with the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocktail</ENAMEX> because the questionable
        contribution of such a study would not be offset by the
        additional cost involved. Published studies do not report
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> immunostaining with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-tyrosinase</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">T311</NUMEX>).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tyrosinase</ENAMEX> alone or any other immunomarker used
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">individually</ENAMEX>, would be less sensitive than a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocktail</ENAMEX>. To
        evaluate the exact impact of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocktail</ENAMEX> in comparison to
        all of its component immunomarkers individually for
        evaluation of sentinel lymph <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">nodes</ENAMEX>, additional studies
        dedicated to comparison of individual component
        immunomarkers with the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocktail</ENAMEX> may be called for.
        Capsular nevi in the form of a few cohesive cocktail
        immunoreactive spindle cells with bland elongated nuclei
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) were observed in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">9/188</NUMEX>) of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</NUMEX>
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">9/88</NUMEX>) of sentinel lymph <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">nodes</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">21%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5/24</NUMEX>) of cases. As
        compared to this, none of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">81</NUMEX> slices of sentinel lymph
        nodes from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> cases of mammary carcinoma showed capsular
        melanocytic nevi. The sentinel lymph nodes of melanocytic
        nevi were from different <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> and none were from the
        axillary region. The exact explanation for this difference
        in the prevalence of capsular nevi could not be deciphered
        and further evaluation is in process. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of
        higher frequency of capsular melanocytic nevi with
        congenital nevi [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> possibility. In our study,
        except for the difference in their regional variation,
        another possible explanation is the cytokine effect of the
        melanoma draining to the sentinel lymph <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">node</ENAMEX>.
        Hypothetically, an association between the higher
        prevalence of melanocytic capsular nevi and the
        predisposition for melanoma may be likely. Although, these
        melanocytic capsular nevi appear benign morphologically, a
        low probability that they may represent subtle metastases
        was also considered. Further evaluation of these and other
        possibilities in larger series is recommended.
        Using immunohistochemistry, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yu et al</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] reported
        capsular benign melanocytic nevi in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">9/235</NUMEX>) of sentinel
        lymph nodes of melanoma from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">8/94</NUMEX>) cases (some cases
        had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> sentinel lymph <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">node</ENAMEX>). Capsular
        melanocytic nevi appear to be the most significant benign
        lesion that could pose a diagnostic challenge in the
        interpretation of melanoma micrometastases in sentinel
        lymph <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">nodes</ENAMEX>. For similar reasons, non-in-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">situ</NUMEX> molecular
        techniques, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 8 24 25 26 27 28 29</NUMEX> ] would
        have higher tendencies for false positive results.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morphology</ENAMEX> appears to be the single most important tool
        facilitating their correct interpretation [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . Other
        approaches, including the observation that capsular nevi
        are non-immunoreactive or weakly immunoreactive for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HMB45</TIMEX>,
        have been suggested for differentiating capsular nevi from
        melanoma micrometastases [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . However, it is important
        to note that a significant number of melanomas are also
        non-immunoreactive for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HMB45</TIMEX>. Thus, strong immunoreactivity
        for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HMB45</TIMEX> rules out capsular nevus, but
        non-immunoreactivity may not be contributory.
        Rather than immunostaining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> adjacent sections with
        individual <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocktail</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> slide is
        required which leads to cost savings. Although, the cost of
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> used in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocktail</ENAMEX> has to be
        incurred, the material and labor cost savings for one
        instead of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> slides is obvious. For proper sampling,
        some studies recommend the evaluation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> levels at
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> μ intervals [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] . In that case, if each of the three
        antibodies in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocktail</ENAMEX> had to be used individually, it
        would require the immunostaining, interpreting, and
        correlating of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> sections. In contrast to this, the
        cocktail requires <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only three</NUMEX> sections, each at intervals of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">200 μ.</ENAMEX> Thus, use of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocktail</ENAMEX> in concert with any
        protocol with reference to number of sections to be
        evaluated and proportion of sentinel lymph <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">node</ENAMEX> to be
        sampled [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30 31</NUMEX> ] would achieve obvious cost saving.
        The most ideal positive control would be the sausage of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> controls immunoreactive individually for one of the
        antibodies but non-immunoreactive for other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> respective
        antibodies in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocktail</ENAMEX>. However, this is a difficult
        positive control to get. The positive control used by us
        showed subtle differences when immunostained with each
        individual <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocktail</ENAMEX> with some areas
        slightly darker than others. However, when the same control
        was immunostained with the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cocktail</ENAMEX>, the entire control
        showed relatively homogeneous immunostaining. The change in
        this immunostaining pattern would suggest the deterioration
        of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the component which can be correlated with the
        same control immunostained with the individual antibodies.
        In addition, another precaution taken by us was that the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cocktail</ENAMEX> was prepared after periodically evaluating
        individual antibodies with the positive control. This later
        approach is the best alternative.
      
      
        Conclusions
        It is possible to use a combination of monoclonal
        antibodies to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MART-1</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Melan-A</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tyrosinase</ENAMEX> as a single
        cocktail reagent on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> glass slide in contrast to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>
        individual antibodies on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> slides. The cocktail
        facilitated easy detection and interpretation of melanoma
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">micrometastases</ENAMEX> in sentinel lymph nodes with reproducible
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inter</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observer</ENAMEX> results. There was favorable increase in the
        detection rate of melanoma micrometastases in sentinel
        lymph nodes as compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MART-1 and Melan</ENAMEX>-A individually.
        Furthermore, this approach leads to obvious cost savings
        and simplifies the interpretation by reducing the number of
        slides to be evaluated.
