        Injury of the spine and back are classified as the most
        frequent cause of limited activity among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> younger
        than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45 years</TIMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Approximately 10 percent</NUMEX> of the
        adult <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> has neck pain at any one time [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] , and
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> will experience low back pain (LBP)
        at some time in their lives [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Five</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 percent</NUMEX> of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workforce</ENAMEX> is off work <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annually</TIMEX> because of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LBP</ENAMEX>. Indeed,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LBP</ENAMEX> is second only to headache among the leading causes of
        pain. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Approximately 80-90%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LBP</ENAMEX> is mechanical
        (non-organic musculoskeletal dysfunction) in origin [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> with mechanical spinal pain often seek and receive
        spinal manipulation by chiropractic, osteopathic and
        allopathic clinicians, physical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">therapists</ENAMEX> or other health
        care <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] .
        Health care <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX> have utilized spinal palpatory
        diagnostic procedures and manual manipulative treatment for
        several millennia to treat back injury and pain [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8</NUMEX> ] .
        Along with the history of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> and physical exam,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">examiners</ENAMEX> utilize specific spinal palpatory diagnostic
        tests in order to identify spinal neuro-musculoskeletal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dysfunction</ENAMEX>. Spinal neuro-musculoskeletal dysfunction
        refers to an alteration of spinal joint position, motion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">characteristics</ENAMEX> and/or related palpable paraspinal soft
        tissue changes. The scientific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committee</ENAMEX> of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Federation of Manual Medicine</ENAMEX> has stated:
        "beneficial outcomes and effectiveness of spinal
        manipulative procedures rely on appropriate and skilled
        treatment that is based on an accurate diagnosis, which in
        turn depends upon the accuracy of the palpatory procedures
        used " [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] .
        Spinal palpatory procedures have been described in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">journals</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11 12</NUMEX> ] and textbooks [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14 15 16 17 18 19</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> ] . Static palpation of anatomical landmarks for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">symmetry</ENAMEX>, palpation of spinal vertebral <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">joints</ENAMEX> before,
        during and after active and passive motion tests, spinal
        and paraspinal soft tissue palpatory assessment for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">abnormalities</ENAMEX> or altered sensitivity are most common.
        Several narrative reviews of the literature on the
        validity and reliability of spinal palpatory diagnostic
        procedures have been published [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28</NUMEX> ]
        . However, most reviews are discipline-specific despite the
        fact that similar spinal palpatory procedures are used
        across disciplines. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only two</NUMEX> systematic reviews of spinal
        palpatory validity studies have been published [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29 30</NUMEX> ] .
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> study was a limited review of chiropractic literature
        on palpatory diagnostic procedures for the lumbar-pelvic
        spine [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] and the other concentrates on validity studies
        at the sacroiliac joint [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] . An annotated bibliography
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] and a systematic review of the primary reliability
        research studies published <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1971 and 2001</TIMEX> are in
        progress.
        Validity and reliability are concepts that are often
        used interchangeably, but the concepts are quite different.
        Validity is the accuracy of a measurement of the true state
        of a phenomenon [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] , while reliability measures the
        concordance, consistency or repeatability of outcomes [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>
        ] . However, even if a measurement is consistent and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">reliable</ENAMEX>, it is not necessarily valid (e.g., an arrow may
        consistently hit the target area, but never hit the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bulls</ENAMEX>-eye).
        There are various types of validity studies. The concept
        of validity differs in qualitative and quantitative
        research [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] . Though it can be argued that palpatory
        diagnostic procedures are subjective and therefore
        qualitative, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> in the field believe they can
        measure a physiological phenomenon that can be detected by
        objective means. They maintain that studies addressing the
        validity of spinal palpatory diagnostic tests are
        quantitative studies. The types of quantitative validity
        studies can be distinguished as follows: face validity;
        construct validity, criterion validity and content
        validity.
        Face validity is the extent to which a test 
        appears to measure what it is
        supposed to measure. In other words, whether the proposed
        test seems to provide a reasonable measure of the concept
        it is intended to measure. For example, spinal vertebral
        joint motion palpation tests, which aim to detect the
        presence of hypomobility, have face validity because they
        seem to be reasonable measures of the concept they are
        intended to measure [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] . Face validity studies have
        been criticized for being subjective, intuitive and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">unsubstantiated</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Troyanovich</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harrison</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] pointed
        out that in spite of the common perception or belief that
        motion tests are valid and reliable for assessment of
        presence or absence of restricted vertebral motion, there
        was no evidence to support this concept. Thus, palpatory
        vertebral motion diagnostic tests are prime examples of
        tests accepted on face validity.
        Construct validity is the extent to which a test
        identifies the concept or trait of that which is being
        measured. A construct is a hypothetical or conceptual idea
        that may be used to label or explain observed phenomenon [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</NUMEX> ] . For example, taking a dysfunctional vertebral joint
        as the concept, a test demonstrating the ability to
        identify the presence or absence of that concept or its
        related <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">components</ENAMEX>, is said to have construct validity.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Feinstein</ENAMEX> describes construct validity as an appraisal of
        the effectiveness with which a measure does its job in
        describing an existing or established construct; i.e. does
        the measure behave the way one would predict on the basis
        of the concept it represents? For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jull et al</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX>
        ] compared cervical spinal static palpation to diagnostic
        nerve <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">blocks</ENAMEX> with anesthesia. The construct is that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tenderness</ENAMEX> upon provocative palpation is related to local
        nerve irritation and nerve <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">conductivity</ENAMEX>. A local anesthetic
        nerve block of related spinal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segments</ENAMEX> showed that the
        identified tender spots no longer elicited a pain response.
        Thus, they demonstrated that there is a high degree of
        correlation between the palpatory test that identified a
        tender spot and the ability of the anesthesia to reverse
        the results of the provocative test. Therefore, the pain
        provocative palpatory tests used were demonstrated to have
        high construct validity.
        Construct validity, however, is an artificial framework
        that is not directly observable [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . To establish
        construct validity of a test or measure, the researcher
        must determine the extent to which the measure correlates
        with other measures designed to measure the same thing and
        whether the measure behaves as expected. Construct validity
        studies do not measure the same phenomena that palpatory
        procedures are designed to measure (i.e., resistance to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">digital</ENAMEX> pressure or motion), but similar phenomena that are
        believed to be related to the palpable phenomena. Many
        construct validity studies on diagnostic spinal palpatory
        tests compare a test's results to another measurement of
        abnormal physiology in the same region. Studies using
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thermography</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] , electromyography [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] , and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coronary angiography</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] fall into this category.
        There are other examples of construct validity studies
        using instruments to measure skin temperature, electrical
        skin resistance and/or gross range of motion to discern a
        dysfunctional vertebral segment. These measurements are
        then compared to those obtained by another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">examiner</ENAMEX> who
        utilizes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or several palpatory procedures that assess
        resistance to joint motion or paraspinal soft tissue
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">abnormalities</ENAMEX> to help to discern a dysfunctional vertebral
        segment. Or, one <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">examiner</ENAMEX> uses pain provocation, and the
        other palpatory motion restriction sense to assess for a
        dysfunctional vertebral segment.
        Criterion validity measures the extent to which an
        intervention allows a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researcher</ENAMEX> to predict behavioral or
        pathological outcomes. Criterion validity studies,
        therefore, do not measure the phenomenon being palpated,
        but attempt to correlate the findings of a palpatory
        procedure (e.g.) with another measurable outcome like
        diagnosed <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">visceral disease</ENAMEX>. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beal</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tarr</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> ] studied the ability of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> using spinal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">palpatory</ENAMEX> procedures to identify, or predict, which
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> had visceral disease related to the spinal
        findings of altered structure, motion and/or soft
        tissue.
        Content validity is the extent to which a measure
        adequately and comprehensively measures what it claims to
        be measuring. Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Troyanovich</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harrison</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ]
        consider face and content validity as synonymous, there is
        an important distinction: content validity studies employ a
        reference standard.
        A reference standard (also called "gold standard") is a
        measure accepted by consensus of content <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> as the
        best available for determining the presence or absence of a
        particular phenomenon. When there is no perfect reference
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">standard</ENAMEX>, as in the case of measurement of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s
        sense of pain provocation, i.e., pressing on a "tender
        point" or "trigger point", then pragmatic criteria can be
        used as a reference standard [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ] . The visual analog
        pain scale has been used as a pragmatic reference standard
        for palpatory pain provocation tests.
        Ideally, content validity studies attempt to compare a
        test with a reference standard of the same phenomenon as
        that which is being palpated, i.e., palpable abnormalities
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX>, motion and soft tissue. The Chiropractic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mercy Center Consensus Conference</ENAMEX> held in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 1993</TIMEX>
        identified and rated the value of various measurement
        instruments related to spinal joint functional assessment
        that could be used as reference standards [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX> ] . Based on
        their critical review of the literature, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Troyanovich</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harrison</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> ] suggested postural assessment instruments
        and radiographic measurement as valid, reliable and
        clinically useful objective measurement tools to help
        identify dysfunctional spinal vertebral <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">joints</ENAMEX>.
        Based on this brief review, it appears that construct
        and criterion validity studies do not measure the
        phenomenon being palpated. Instead they attempt to
        correlate the findings of a palpatory procedure with
        another measurable outcome. On the other hand, content
        validity studies measure the same phenomenon as that which
        is being palpated. Given how important it is to know
        whether the diagnostic tests used in palpatory exams are
        valid, we conducted a systematic review to assess the
        content validity of spinal palpatory tests used to identify
        spinal neuro-musculoskeletal dysfunction.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Study setting
          The study was conducted at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Susan Samueli Center</ENAMEX>
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Complementary and Alternative Medicine</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Irvine</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UCI</ENAMEX>]). A multi-disciplinary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> of
          clinicians, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">statistician</ENAMEX>, and a health
          sciences <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">librarian</ENAMEX> participated in the systematic review.
          The clinicians represented content area expertise in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">osteopathic</ENAMEX> and chiropractic medicine, family medicine,
          and clinical research. In addition, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> had
          expertise and experience in evidence-based <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX>,
          research design and methodology.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Inclusion / Exclusion Criteria</ENAMEX>
          The study inclusion/ exclusion criteria were adapted
          and modified from those published previously by the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cochrane Collaboration</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX> ] and others [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46 47</NUMEX> ] .
          Studies included in the review met <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the following four</TIMEX>
          criteria: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) the studies pertained to manual spinal
          (cervical, thoracic, lumbar, and surrounding para-spinal
          soft tissue but not the sacrum or pelvis) palpation
          procedures; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) the studies included measurement of
          validity or accuracy of spinal palpation, where validity
          was defined as the capability of the manual spinal
          palpation procedure to do what it is supposed to do and
          accuracy was defined as a measure of how well it actually
          does that (content validity); <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) the studies were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dissertations</ENAMEX> or a primary research studies published in
          a peer-reviewed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journal</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) the document could be written
          in any language; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>) the primary research must have been
          published or accepted for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publication</ENAMEX>; and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>) all studies
          were made available <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between January 1, 1966 and September</TIMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30, 2002</TIMEX>. Studies were excluded from the review based on
          the following criteria. First, the data pertained to
          non-manual procedure(s). <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, the studies included a
          whole regimen of tests or methods; without separate data
          for each test, and/or the data for spinal palpatory
          procedure could not be retrieved. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, although the
          document retrieved was relevant to the subject matter, it
          was anecdotal, speculative, or editorial in nature.
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Fourth</NUMEX>, the document retrieved was inconsistent with the
          inclusion criteria (see Additional file <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). After review
          of the retrieved papers, a secondary exclusion criterion,
          inappropriate statistical tests used, was applied.
          Appropriate statistical tests included: sensitivity and

          Search strategy
          A comprehensive strategy was designed to conduct a
          detailed search of pertinent literature that addressed
          the study question, "What is the content validity of
          spinal palpatory tests used to identify spinal
          neuro-musculoskeletal dysfunction<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">?</ENAMEX>" Specifics on the
          search strategy are described in another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX> ] .
          In brief, our search strategy included both online and
          manual searches for appropriate literature. For the
          online search of literature, we defined a detailed search
          template, which we applied to appropriate databases. The
          basic search template included <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">MeSH</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Descriptors</ENAMEX> (from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MANTIS</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Biosis</ENAMEX>, etc.), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medical Subject</ENAMEX> headings from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CINAHL</ENAMEX>, and related key terms generated by the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">review team</ENAMEX> (see Additional file
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). This defined the research question into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> key
          concepts: validity/validity findings, spine, palpation
          procedure, and neuro-musculoskeletal dysfunctions.

          Click here for file
          Limits for the search template included: human
          studies, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publications</ENAMEX> in all languages, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journal</ENAMEX> articles
          (research articles and conference proceedings if in
          press), dissertations, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publications</ENAMEX> between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January</TIMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1, 1966 and September 30, 2002</TIMEX>. We applied the search
          template, with minor modifications to optimize and
          enhance the search outcome of individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">databases</ENAMEX>, to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>
          databases that had a potential coverage for the areas of
          osteopathic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX>, allopathic medicine, chiropractic,
          and physical therapy. The databases accessed by the
          project included: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PubMed MEDLINE</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MANTIS</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CINAHL</ENAMEX>, Web of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Science, Current Contents</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BIOSIS</ENAMEX>, EMBase OCLC
          FirstSearch, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cochrane</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Osteopathic Database</ENAMEX>, and Index to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chiropractic Literature</ENAMEX>. The selection of databases was
          based primarily on the availability of online resources
          that we could access from our affiliated institution
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">libraries</ENAMEX>.
          In addition to the online literature search strategy,
          we used manual methods to identify appropriate
          literature. These manual methods included gleaning
          references that were cited in studies selected from the
          online search, consulting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> in the fields of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chiropractic</ENAMEX> and osteopathic medicine, contacting authors
          of eligible conference abstracts, and manually searching
          bibliographies of osteopathic text-books and review
          articles on somatic dysfunction.
        
        
          Review strategy
          We used a three-step selection process to identify
          articles for the systematic review. First, we reviewed
          titles identified through the online search, and excluded
          those which gave no indication that the studies pertained
          to validity. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, we reviewed the abstracts of all the
          remaining studies identified through the application of
          our search template, and excluded studies that did not

          complete paper and applied the inclusion/exclusion
          criteria to studies included at step <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>.
          In all, based on the online and manual searches, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</NUMEX>

          The remaining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43</NUMEX> studies were excluded, because they did
          not study spinal palpation procedures, did not assess
          content validity, and/or did not use appropriate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">statistical</ENAMEX> tests (see Additional file <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Several of the
          abstracts reviewed at step <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of the selection process
          did not provide clarity towards a study's focus (spinal

          Review instruments
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> instruments were developed to extract the data and
          assess the quality of the studies reviewed. The
          instruments were developed taking into consideration
          previously published guidelines [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">49 50</NUMEX> ] , and
          instruments [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">51 52 53 54 55</NUMEX> ] . To maximize objectivity
          in the evaluation of paper quality, a checklist of
          quality factors was developed and transformed into a
          quality assessment instrument. The factors were grouped
          into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> major components of quality: study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">examiner</ENAMEX> characteristics, the reference standard used,
          palpatory test, study conditions, data analysis and
          presentation of results (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>).
          Detailed information on the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> components identified to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">denote</ENAMEX> internal validity and quality of a study were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">abstracted</ENAMEX> and scored. In terms of the subject
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">characteristics</ENAMEX>, we considered criteria such as their
          socio-demographic description, presentation
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">characteristics</ENAMEX> and severity of symptoms, selection
          criteria and sample size determination procedures, sample
          size and recruitment procedures. Information regarding
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">examiners</ENAMEX> pertained to their selection criteria,
          sample size, and background. The reference standard (if
          used) and palpatory procedure information pertinent to
          the quality scoring included a description of the tests,
          their reliability and expected outcomes, and definition
          of positive or negative test results. The study
          conditions were documented with regards to consensus on
          and description of the palpatory procedure, the training
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">examiners</ENAMEX> in the procedure, and blinding of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">examiners</ENAMEX>
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>. For information on the data analysis and
          results, we abstracted information on the type of
          statistical procedure(s) used to assess validity and how
          the results were displayed and described.
          The quality assessment instrument focused mainly on
          the internal validity, taking into consideration biases
          reported previously namely: selection, performance,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">measurement</ENAMEX>, and attrition bias. A weight was assigned to
          each criterion based on a group consensus. A maximum
          score of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> points was set. In designing this instrument
          we differentiated between quality of an article (i.e.
          conduct of the trial and reproducibility) and validity,
          which relates to the ability of the study to answer the
          research question. The data extraction and quality
          assessment instruments were structured to mirror each
          other and facilitate the review and scoring.
          Using the quality assessment instrument, each article
          was reviewed and scored on the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> major components,
          discussed above, by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-blinded <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reviewers</ENAMEX> (title, names
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>(s) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journal</ENAMEX> were removed). The quality
          scores included an "absolute" score (i.e., total points
          received on all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> components of the quality
          assessment form) and a "relative" score (i.e., [absolute
          score/ total score that could be obtained] <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">× 100</NUMEX>). The
          relative score was especially important for studies
          wherein certain aspects of the quality scoring components
          were inapplicable (i.e., the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>' criteria was
          inapplicable for studies which used mechanical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> or
          measures). An article's score (absolute or relative)
          indicated its quality in terms of its internal validity
          criteria (whether conclusions drawn from study are likely
          to be unbiased) and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX>' explicit description of
          the study. Although important, the quality score does not
          imply a study's significance or impact (in terms of
          findings, relevance to the discipline). Based on prior
          recommendations, the overall quality of studies was

          assessed through the summary scores and the relevant
          methodological issues pertinent toward internal validity
          of a study were assessed individually and their influence
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">explored</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">55</TIMEX> ] .
          A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot</ENAMEX> test of the data extraction and quality
          assessment instruments was conducted on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> articles
          randomly selected from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</NUMEX> studies evaluated during
          step <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of the study selection process. After
          completion of the pilot test, we made changes to further
          clarify and simplify the instruments. For the final
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">review</ENAMEX>, the articles were blinded to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journal</ENAMEX>, title and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX>, and randomly assigned to a pair of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reviewers</ENAMEX>. In
          all, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reviewers</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> pairs) conducted the final
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">review</ENAMEX>, abstracted pertinent data and scored each article
          based on the quality assessment instrument.
          We used descriptive statistics on the quality
          assessment data to determine agreement/disagreement among
          a pair of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reviewers</ENAMEX>, and to present the data. The
          descriptive statistics included standard deviation (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S.D.</ENAMEX>)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">/ Mean</ENAMEX> ratio, histogram and variability. To achieve a
          consensus between the pair of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reviewers</ENAMEX> on the scoring of
          each article, we calculated the standard deviation (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S.D.</ENAMEX>)
          to mean score percentage. Agreement on quality scores was
          defined as <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 10%</NUMEX> variance (S.D./Mean ratio), in
          the paired <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reviewers</ENAMEX>' scores on each article. When the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">S.D./Mean</ENAMEX> ratio variance between the paired <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reviewers</ENAMEX>'
          score was equal to, or exceeded <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX>, the pair of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">reviewers</ENAMEX> attempted to reach a consensus on each of the
          criteria where disagreement existed. When reviewers
          failed to arrive at a consensus on the quality score, two
          content <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> reviewed and scored the topic in
          contention by consensus.
        
      
      
        Results
        
          Study description
          A total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> studies, from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</NUMEX> articles
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">retrieved</ENAMEX> and reviewed, met our inclusion criteria for
          content validity and are discussed in this study (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TABLE</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). The remaining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43</NUMEX> studies [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64</NUMEX>

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">retrieved</ENAMEX>, reviewed and excluded from our study because
          they either did not address manual palpation

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">validity</ENAMEX>, or used inappropriate statistics (see
          Additional file <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> studies were published in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>
          different <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">journals</ENAMEX> and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX> study included is a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dissertation</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">99</TIMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> studies were unfunded (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dissertation</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">99</TIMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1</ENAMEX> did not report any funding [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> ] ). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> studies [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">101 102</NUMEX> ] , were funded by a
          Research <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Council</ENAMEX> and a liability insurance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">provider</ENAMEX>, and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> study, [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">103</ENAMEX> ] was funded by the Chiropractic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Advancement Association</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Subjects
          The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> motion palpation studies were done in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Kingdom</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">All three</NUMEX> studies utilized mechanical
          models as the study subjects as well as the reference
          standard. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> pain studies were done in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sweden</ENAMEX>. One
          study [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">101</ENAMEX> ] , recruited only pregnant female subjects
          (n = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX>, representing a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> response rate: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200/222</NUMEX>),
          while the other study [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">102</ENAMEX> ] recruited an entirely male
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">population</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">75</NUMEX>, they failed to report the response
          rate) with acute (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 1</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week</TIMEX>) neck pain,
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Examiners</ENAMEX>
          Senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chiropractic students</ENAMEX> and/or experienced (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">>3</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">yrs</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">practitioners</ENAMEX> were the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">examiners</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> motion
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">palpation</ENAMEX> studies. One physical therapist was the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">examiner</ENAMEX> in the cervical spine pain provocation study.
          The lumbar spine pain provocation study [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">101</ENAMEX> ] , did not
          specify the background of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">examiner</ENAMEX>(s).
        
        
          Design
          All the studies used a prospective study design. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>
          studies the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">examiners</ENAMEX> were blinded to fixation levels or
          clinical presentation. In one pain study [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">101</ENAMEX> ] blinding
          was not described.
        
        
          Measurement
          Among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> studies using mechanical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100 103</NUMEX> ] looked at intersegmental motion restriction,
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">99</TIMEX> ] looked at the ability to determine
          fixation levels. The mechanical model was the reference
          standard used.
          The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> pain studies used digital pressure and
          percussion to elicit pain. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Visual Analog Scale</ENAMEX> (VAS) and
          pain reported by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> were used as reference
          standards. Reliability of the palpation procedure was not
          reported in any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX> with the exception of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">103</ENAMEX> ]
          looking at motion palpation in a mechanical model.
        
        
          Quality <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Scoring Findings</ENAMEX>
          In general the quality score would indicate the rigor
          with which the science was presented in the paper.
          Quality scores of included studies ranged from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45.5 to 82</NUMEX>
          out of a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">possible100</TIMEX>. The overall quality of the included
          studies was good for those focusing on motion palpation
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">69.5</NUMEX> - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">82</NUMEX>), and fair for those looking at pain (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45.5</NUMEX> -
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">55.5</NUMEX>) (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>). Discussion of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">examiners</ENAMEX> and study
          conditions were the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> major areas where weakness was
          noted in the two pain studies, but not in the motion
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">palpation</ENAMEX> studies. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Statistical</ENAMEX> tests used were adequate
          for all studies (this was one of the inclusion criteria).
          All studies were done in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX>'s; hence the time
          factor was not felt to be contributive.
        
        
          Study findings
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Motion Palpation Tests</ENAMEX>
            The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> studies examining motion palpation were
            similar in using a mechanical model as the reference
            standard and focusing on the lumbar spine only. While
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> studies used similar <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">examiner groups</ENAMEX> and motion
            test, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> study [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">99</TIMEX> ] looked only at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> group
            of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">examiners</ENAMEX> using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different motion test
            procedures.
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> studies [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100 103</NUMEX> ] looked at intersegmental
            motion restriction, using sagital and coronal motion as
            determined by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of chiropractic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">examiners</ENAMEX> with
            different experience levels (senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> and
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">practitioners</ENAMEX>). Both studies presented data on
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sensitivity</ENAMEX> (ability of a test to detect correctly
            restricted motion segments) and specificity (ability of
            a test to detect correctly unrestricted motion
            segments). The sensitivity for both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> in each
            study varied <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between 0.510 and 0.636</NUMEX>, and the
            specificity from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.868 to 0.902</NUMEX>, indicating less
            ability to detect restricted motion segments than
            unrestricted motion segments. The sensitivity for
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">practitioners</ENAMEX> in both studies was poor (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.478</NUMEX> and
            <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.526</NUMEX>). For <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>, the sensitivity was lower in the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harvey</ENAMEX> study (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.538</NUMEX>) than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jensen</ENAMEX> study (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.720</NUMEX>).
            Based on the data provided in each of the studies we
            calculated the positive and negative predictive (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPV</ENAMEX>;
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPV</ENAMEX>) values and the likelihood ratio (LR) for each
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPV</ENAMEX> was less than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50.0%</NUMEX> in both studies, for
            both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42.3</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">46.2%</NUMEX>) and for each subgroup. While
            the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPV</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">greater than 80%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">83</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">93.7%</NUMEX>) supporting the
            above statement of better capability of these tests at
            detecting unrestricted than restricted motion (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>).
            The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> motion palpation study [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">99</TIMEX> ] looked at
            intersegmental motion restriction as determined by
            <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral flexion</ENAMEX> and posterior-anterior springing (PAS).
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Examiners</ENAMEX> were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> senior <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">chiropractic students</ENAMEX>.
            Sensitivity for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral flexion</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">41.2%</NUMEX> and for PAS
            <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">42.8%</NUMEX>, while specificity for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral flexion</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">61.5%</NUMEX>
            and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAS</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">62.2%</NUMEX> indicating that the motion palpation
            procedures utilized were neither sensitive nor specific
            for detecting spinal segmental motion restriction. The
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">calculated PPV</ENAMEX> (< <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">31.0%</NUMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPV</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">73.7%</NUMEX> for both
            tests) supported this conclusion.
          
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pain Provocation</ENAMEX>
            The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> studies differed in procedure location
            (cervical vs. thoracic & lumbar), reference
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">standard</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VAS</ENAMEX> vs. subjective <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> report),
            provocation test used and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> studied.
            The cervical study [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">102</ENAMEX> ] assessed presence or
            absence of pain as reported by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> upon
            palpation of their facet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">joints</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sensitivity</ENAMEX> (ability
            of the test to identify presence of pain in subjects
            reporting pain symptoms) was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">82%</NUMEX> and specificity
            (ability of the test to identify the absence of pain in
            asymptomatic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>) was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">79%</NUMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPV</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">62%</NUMEX> and NPV
            was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">91%</NUMEX>. The results indicate that the test procedure,
            as performed, is moderately good at identifying
            subjects with neck pain and very good at identifying
            asymptomatic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>.
            The thoracic and lumbar spine study [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">101</ENAMEX> ] used the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VAS</ENAMEX> as the reference standard and assessed the
            relationship between the clinical back status and
            reported pain locations during and after pregnancy. Two
            types of pain provocation tests were used: digital
            pressure (within <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 cm</NUMEX> of the midline) and lumbar
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">percussion</ENAMEX>. In the thoracic region, digital pressure
            (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DP</ENAMEX>) sensitivity was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">17.8%</NUMEX>, specificity was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">98.5%</NUMEX>,
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">calculated PPV</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">72.2%</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPV</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">84.4%</NUMEX>. In the
            lumbar <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DP</ENAMEX> sensitivity was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">21.2%</NUMEX>, specificity
            was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">96.19%</NUMEX>, calculated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPV</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">61.76%</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NPV</ENAMEX> was
            <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80.83%</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">lumbar percussion sensitivity</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.1%</NUMEX>,
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">specificity</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX>, calculated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPV</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> and NPV
            was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">78.4%</NUMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 6</ENAMEX>). These results suggest that the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thoracic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DP</ENAMEX> test was better at identifying asymptomatic
            than symptomatic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>. Both tests performed in the
            lumbar <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> were unable to discriminate adequately
            between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>.
          
        
      
      
        Discussion
        To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">comprehensive</ENAMEX> systematic review of literature on the
        content validity of spinal palpatory procedures. To
        reiterate, it is imperative to focus on studies assessing
        content validity of procedures since, by definition, they
        attempt to measure the same phenomenon as that which is
        being palpated. Studies with a focus on other forms of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">validity</ENAMEX> (i.e., face, construct and criterion), although
        important, provide information which does not directly
        answer the question, "Does the procedure (i.e., palpation)
        measure (or assess) the phenomenon it is supposed to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">assess?</ENAMEX>" but attempt to correlate the findings of a
        palpatory procedure with another measurable outcome.
        The systematic review revealed several methodological,
        reporting and research issues which severely constrained
        integrative, qualitative and quantitative evaluations such
        as systematic reviews and meta-analysis. The evaluation of
        the validity of spinal palpatory procedures has a number of
        methodological challenges. In particular, there is no
        agreed upon reference or "gold" standard measuring device
        for spinal palpatory procedures. A reference standard is
        the best available independently established test/procedure
        used to determine the presence or absence of a phenomenon.
        In the absence of well-established reference standards, one
        would use other research designs, such as pragmatic
        criteria (e.g., pain scales), independent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">expert</ENAMEX> panels,
        clinical follow-up (delayed type cross sectional study),
        standardized protocols or prognostic criteria [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">104</ENAMEX> ] . One
        may also use the most reproducible and reliable test or the
        most experienced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">examiner</ENAMEX> as a reference standard. Some
        designs utilize invasive procedures, e.g., surgery,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">histopathology</ENAMEX> or angiography or a combination of tests to
        serve as a reference standard.
        It is important to identify a reference standard to
        which a palpatory diagnostic test is compared to ensure
        that it actually measures what it purports to measure
        (i.e., that a test for resistance to motion actually
        measures resistance to motion). Spinal palpatory diagnostic
        procedures, like vertebral joint motion restriction
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assessment</ENAMEX>, are difficult to objectively measure in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>.
        The concept of a neuro-musculoskeletal spinal dysfunction
        that is corrected by non-invasive manual spinal
        manipulation has no agreed upon reference standard.
        Typically, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">conglomerate</ENAMEX> of findings of altered position,
        motion characteristics and paraspinal soft tissue feel is
        necessary to make the diagnosis. X-rays can be validated by
        altered position. Altered motion has been difficult to
        validate due to the difficulty of finding a suitable
        reference standard. However, in order to assess an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">examiner</ENAMEX>'s ability to discern resistance to vertebral joint
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">motion</ENAMEX>, the plastic spinal <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> with an artificially fixed
        vertebral <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> has been employed as a reference
        standard. Altered tissue feel can be validated in part by
        measuring skin moisture, temperature, friction, and
        resistance to pressure. A reference standard used for
        palpatory pain provocation tests has been the visual analog
        or numeric pain scale [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">105 106 107</NUMEX> ] .
        Given that face, construct and criterion validity
        studies do not measure the phenomenon being palpated, but
        attempt to correlate the findings of a palpatory procedure
        with another measurable outcome, only content validity
        studies, which attempt to measure the same phenomenon as
        that which is being palpated were included in this
        systematic review.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Physicians</ENAMEX> (orthopedists, physiatrists, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neurologists</ENAMEX>,
        emergency <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX>, family medicine, sports <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">etc.</ENAMEX>), chiropractors, massage <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">therapists</ENAMEX>, osteopaths, and
        physical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">therapists</ENAMEX> use manual palpatory exams regularly in
        their practice. However very few studies (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#5</NUMEX>) have
        attempted to assess the content validity (as defined in
        this paper) of these widely used tests. Among the few
        validity studies identified, motion palpation tests were
        evaluated only by chiropractors and pain studies by
        physical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">therapists</ENAMEX>.
        In this review <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> studies focused on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> types of
        tests: fixation (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#2</NUMEX>), range of motion (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#1</NUMEX>) and pain (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#2</NUMEX>).
        The quality scores of motion palpation studies were good;
        however all the tests had poor sensitivity. This indicates
        that the motion palpatory tests (intersegmental, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">flexion</ENAMEX> and posterior-anterior springing) are not able to
        identify areas of fixation or motion restriction. A poor
        positive predictive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Value</ENAMEX> (PPV) supported this finding. The
        pain provocation studies reported good validity for
        evaluation of pain in the cervical region but not in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">lumbar</ENAMEX> area. This result confirms the results of a
        previously published [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">108</ENAMEX> ] study indicating a higher
        sensitivity for identifying pain in the cervical region
        compared to the lumbar spine.
        Unfortunately, most of the research study results
        reported are not comparable due to variability in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">palpatory</ENAMEX> tests, terminology, research design, methodology
        and statistical analysis utilized. These inconsistencies
        make it difficult to rate the relative value of their
        results. There is a worldwide concerted effort underway to
        rectify this problem. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Federation of</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manual Medicine</ENAMEX> (FIMM), an international <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">physicians</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">surgeons</ENAMEX> who practice manual <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX> held
        their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Assembly</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 2001</TIMEX>. At that
        meeting, their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scientific Committee</ENAMEX> reported that their top
        priority is to promote validity, reliability, sensitivity
        and specificity studies of spinal palpatory diagnostic
        procedures. They recently developed guidelines ("Protocol
        Formats") on how to perform high quality validity and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reliability</ENAMEX> studies of spinal palpatory procedures, which
        are available on their web site [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . They recommend the
        use of valid palpatory tests so that homogeneous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> with spinal musculoskeletal dysfunction can be
        selected and treated as part of a controlled clinical
        trial. The results of these trials can subsequently be
        combined using meta-analysis and would help formulate
        guidelines for the practice of spinal manipulation.
        It is difficult to translate these results into the
        clinical setting due to the limited number of studies,
        focused anatomical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> studied. Also,
        argument could be advanced that the use of a mechanical
        model may not have external validity when applied to human
        subjects. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">All three</NUMEX>-motion palpation studies used a
        mechanical model as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> and reference standard,
        and focused on the lumbar spine. Findings indicate poor
        validity of the motion palpation tests. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> pain studies
        are of fair to poor quality. One focused on examining pain
        in the lumbar spine of pregnant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, and the other on
        pain in the cervical spine among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> with acute
        injuries.
        To translate these results into the clinical setting,
        additional studies exploring the content validity of spinal
        palpatory exams, using accepted reference standards are
        needed. Identifying a perfect (error free) reference
        standard for each palpatory test is challenging. Even
        widely accepted reference standards are imperfect (e.g.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">histopathology</ENAMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">109</ENAMEX> ] . Therefore identifying a perfect
        reference standard is not as important as identifying an
        acceptable reference standard. Content <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX> in this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">field</ENAMEX> should come to an agreement on acceptable reference
        standards for spinal palpatory tests.
        This review is unique a) by the cooperative work among a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">multidisciplinary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">team</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> and content-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX>;
        b) the review was not limited to any specific discipline or
        language; c) the focus on content validity is practical and
        clinically relevant to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">practitioners</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">d</ENAMEX>) a
        great effort and detail went into the development of the
        search strategy, inclusion/exclusion criteria and
        quality-scoring instrument.
        The search strategy included <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> databases and was done
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times using general and specific keywords and
        strategies to verify results. The quality-scoring
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">instrument</ENAMEX> was developed taking into consideration
        strengths and weakness of published instruments,
        recommendations by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QUOROM</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">110</ENAMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CONSORT</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">111 112</NUMEX>
        ] statements as well as the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cochrane</ENAMEX> criteria. In addition
        this study makes a contribution to the field of
        manipulation and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX>, in general, by highlighting the
        limited research and reference standards in this field. It
        also provides future <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> with a guideline to follow
        to design a successful content validity study.
        As with a majority of reviews, this is a retrospective
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">review</ENAMEX>, which makes it susceptible to potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bias</ENAMEX> (publication quality). The focused definition used for
        content validity limits the studies that are included in
        this review. However, this strategy allowed more clarity
        since only content validity studies were included in this
        systematic review. Despite the number of safeguards used to
        be inclusive (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple databases</ENAMEX>, hand search, review by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">experts</ENAMEX>, and multiple searches) in our search, a few
        studies published but not included in these databases could
        have been missed.
        The quality assessment tool, used for this review, was
        developed by this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">team</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> based on their
        evaluation of the literature, feedback from methodologists
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">statisticians</ENAMEX>. Although we feel that the instrument is
        well balanced and unbiased, it might have over or
        underestimated the quality of certain papers. When
        comparing the quality <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scores</ENAMEX> assigned to studies included
        in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scores</ENAMEX> assigned to the same papers in
        another systematic review [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] , one notes that our
        scores are consistently lower.
      
      
        Conclusion
        Despite the use of manual spinal palpation by many
        health care disciplines, very few studies investigated
        their ability to measure what they intend to measure
        (content validity). Given the high frequency of spinal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pathology</ENAMEX> and the use of these diagnostic methods to
        investigate them, well-designed studies are needed. For the
        practice of evidence-based <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX>, it is important to
        assess the efficacy and effectiveness of procedures usually
        and customarily used in clinical practice. To this end,
        established benchmarks for the validity and reliability of
        procedures are essential.
        This comprehensive systematic review has highlighted
        serious gaps in our knowledge about the accuracy of spinal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">palpatory</ENAMEX> procedures. The findings have implications for
        research, clinical practice, and policy. From the research
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">perspective</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> across discipline need to
        incorporate more rigor towards the definition of the study
        questions, methods and measures, implementation procedures,
        and reporting. The absence of well identified reference
        standards and possible technical difficulties conducting
        these studies might have contributed to this scarcity.
        From the clinical perspective, the findings suggest poor
        sensitivity of the range of motion and pain diagnostic
        tests in the evaluation of spinal dysfunction. From a
        policy perspective, given that manual procedures are a
        cornerstone towards diagnostic and therapeutic
        interventions across disciplines, professional societies
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> need to enact continuing medical education
        and research guidelines to address the efficacy of spinal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">palpatory</ENAMEX> procedures.
