        Microarrays have become standard tools for gene
        expression analysis as the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">messenger RNA</ENAMEX> levels of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of genes can be measured in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> assay. In a
        standard microarray experiment, total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> or mRNA is
        extracted from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> or tissue, labeled by reverse
        transcription with radioactive or fluorescent-tag-labeled
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nucleotides</ENAMEX> and hybridized to the arrays. After
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridization</ENAMEX> and washing, the arrays are scanned and the
        hybridization intensities at each spot are determined by
        image-analysis software. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX>-channel microarrays open up
        the possibility of carrying out many hybridizations in
        parallel using a common reference <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>. In such experiments,
        different experimental conditions can be compared to each
        other. In many cases, different conditions are analyzed
        with some replications to allow variance analysis [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2</ENAMEX>].
        This procedure results in multivariate grouped data in
        which <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> represents a condition with several
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">replicates</ENAMEX>. Such data can be represented as a matrix with 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> rows (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>) and 
        p columns (hybridizations) and a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vector</ENAMEX> of length 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> containing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> labels. These
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> are characteristic of multi-condition microarray
        experiments.
        To analyze such data, multivariate statistics are
        needed. Before carrying out the analysis, the data must be
        pre-processed by background subtraction, computation of
        ratios and array-wise normalization. After this step, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> can be analyzed using different multivariate
        approaches. These methods can be classified as supervised
        and unsupervised. A wide variety of supervised approaches
        have been described, for example, classification and
        regression <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>] or support vector machines [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>].
        Among unsupervised methods, hierarchical clustering [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>]
        and other clustering approaches [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6, 7</ENAMEX>], as well as
        projection methods such as multidimensional scaling [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>],
        principal components analysis (PCA) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9, 10, 11, 12, 13</TIMEX>]
        and correspondence analysis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>] have been described. Such
        projection techniques reduce the dimensionality of
        multivariate data to embed the variables and objects of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> in a visualizable (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>- or three-dimensional) space.
        The projection aims to represent the objects and variables
        in the reduced space in such a way that they approximate
        their original distances in the high-dimensional <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">space</ENAMEX>.
        This enables <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to extract and visualize the dominant
        effects on variance from the data. With <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCA</ENAMEX>, linear
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">combinations</ENAMEX> (principal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">components</ENAMEX>) of the original
        variables can thus be functionally interpreted (for review
        see [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>]). This enables a biological interpretation of the
        nature of coherent variation.
        In <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">microarray</ENAMEX> experiments, the identification of subsets
        of genes with large variation between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> is of primary
        interest. This process has to comprise a criterion that
        accounts for the variance within <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. Sometimes this
        selection is only the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step in the data analysis.
        Hastie 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>] carried out
        hierarchical clustering of gene-expression data and
        computed an average expression profile for each cluster,
        providing the input for a response model. A direct
        significance analysis to select <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> from microarray data
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">SAM</ENAMEX>) was proposed by Tusher 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>]. This method is based
        on 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> -like (in the case of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
        conditions) or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-</ENAMEX>like statistics.
        Several methods for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> selection involving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCA</ENAMEX> have
        been proposed. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">'gene shaving</ENAMEX>' approach of Hastie 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>] restricts <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCA</ENAMEX> to the
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">principal</ENAMEX> component. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Groups</ENAMEX> of genes are generated by
        iterative exclusion of fixed fractions of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (typically
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX>) with smallest absolute loadings according to the first
        principal component. After orthogonalization of the data
        with respect to an averaged expression profile of the first
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX>, the procedure is repeated. Another <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">PCA</ENAMEX>-based method
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> selection using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PCA-</ENAMEX>derived gene coefficient
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vectors</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-</ENAMEX>statistics was described by Landgrebe 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>].
        Although these methods allow the detection of patterns
        or 'characteristic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nodes</ENAMEX>' by dimension reduction and the
        selection of gene subsets with large variation between
        condition <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, the reliability of the results has to be
        determined. Therefore, it is imperative to assess whether
        the results are statistically reliable relative to the
        level of noise in the data. Classical statistical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">parametric</ENAMEX> tests depend on the assumptions of normality and
        independence of variables (hybridizations). Yet, these
        assumptions do not hold for microarray data [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 19</ENAMEX>].
        Consequently, computationally intensive methods such as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">permutation</ENAMEX> tests or bootstrap procedures as introduced by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Efron</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>] are preferable. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kerr</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>] show the application of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bootstrap</ENAMEX> technique to clustering results. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ghosh</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>]
        describes another approach based on mixture modeling to
        assess the reliability of clustering results. Other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">permutation</ENAMEX>-based approaches were published by Tusher 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>] and Dudoit 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>]. The method proposed by
        Hastie 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>] also contains bootstrap
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX>. An approach of Wall 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>] tries to combine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">PCA</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> selection with a confidence measure using
        leave-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-out cross-validation.
        Here we describe an approach combining PCA-directed gene
        selection with validation by permutation tests. We use a
        test statistic based on the genes' object scores to select
        genes with high variance with respect to the principal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">components</ENAMEX>. The method was developed for the analysis of
        microarray data having several conditions with a few
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">replicates</ENAMEX> per condition or a group <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX>. We
        demonstrate this approach by applying it to the
        well-characterized data of Spellman 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>]. Although other methods
        are better adapted to the analysis of temporal effects (for
        example [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>]), we chose the yeast data to allow comparison
        with other approaches applied to this dataset [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14, 23</TIMEX>]. In
        addition, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">datasets</ENAMEX> generated in our own <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX> were
        also analyzed. Our method was successfully applied to the
        different datasets. We revealed the main <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variance</ENAMEX> in the data and described the genes related to
        this variance. This allowed the interpretation of variance
        and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">permutation-validated</ENAMEX> selection of genes in a
        functional context.
      
      
        Results
        
          Permutation-test-validated PCA
          We carried out permutation-test-validated PCA on
          grouped data with few replicates to study variation in
          gene expression across several conditions, to understand
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> of the data, to uncover patterns underlying
          the hybridization conditions and to identify subsets of
          genes with large variation across these patterns. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCA</ENAMEX> is
          primarily aimed at finding and interpreting complex
          relationships between variables in a dataset. Correlated
          variables are converted to factors that are not
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">correlated</ENAMEX> to each other. The central point of such
          analysis is to decompose the original 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> Ã— 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> data matrix ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> objects, 
          p variables) in the following
          manner:
          
          X = 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AF T</ENAMEX> 
          where 
          X is the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> Ã— 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> data matrix, 
          A is the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> Ã— 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p matrix</ENAMEX> of factor scores and 
          F is the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> Ã— 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p matrix</ENAMEX> of factor loadings. With 
          s = 
          p factors the total variance of all
          variables is explained. The decomposition of 
          X is done in such a way that the
          factors explain the total variance in a descending order.
          Therefore, it is possible to reduce the data to 
          s dimensions with a minimum loss of
          information expressed by the matrix of residuals 
          E: 
          
          where Ãƒ is the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> Ã— 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s matrix</ENAMEX> of factor scores, the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> Ã— 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s matrix</ENAMEX> of factor loadings and 
          E is the matrix of residuals as a
          result of dimension reduction. In this manner, PCA
          provides a projection of the objects from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p -dimensional</ENAMEX> to 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">s -dimensional</ENAMEX> space.
          In grouped data with replicates per <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">condition</ENAMEX>),
          there is additional information about the columns of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data matrix</ENAMEX>: 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">y'</ENAMEX> = ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">y</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 ,</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">y</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ,..., 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">y</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX>  ) is a set of class labels
          identifying the replicates for each condition. Although
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCA</ENAMEX> is generally not considered to be appropriate for
          grouped data, the method has been adapted for this data
          type (rank-ordered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCA</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>]).
          The consecutive steps of the permutation validated PCA
          procedure are shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. In step <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, we perform
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rank</ENAMEX>-ordered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCA</ENAMEX> based on the polished gene expression
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">matrix</ENAMEX> 
          X (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and methods) by
          computing separate oneway ANOVAs on the principal
          components loadings for each of the components. If the
          between<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">-group</ENAMEX> variance dominates the total variability in
          the data, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCA</ENAMEX> discriminates between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. In this
          situation, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> components of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCA</ENAMEX> and components
          with high <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-</ENAMEX>values are identical. Thus, following the
          order of explained variance, we select the components
          with significant <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-</ENAMEX>statistics ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p â</ENAMEX>‰<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">¤ 0.01</NUMEX>). At the occurrence of a
          component with nonsignificant <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-</ENAMEX>statistics, we terminate
          the selection. This process results in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k components</ENAMEX> (step <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">approximated</ENAMEX> in the space based on these components
          reflect the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> variance. Thus, in step <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> of
          the procedure, we compute components from the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX>-averaged data and derive the exact between-group
          variance for each gene, which can be estimated by:
          
          where 
          a 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">gi</ENAMEX> 
           is the factor score for gene 
          g and component 
          i . As a test value, we use (step
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). Genes with a high value are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> for
          selection.
          To assess the reliability of the results we perform a
          permutation analysis (steps <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4-6</ENAMEX>). Under the hypothesis of
          no effect of different conditions on gene expression
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">profiles</ENAMEX>, the class labels given by 
          y' are randomly sampled to
          determine the permutation distribution of the required
          test statistics. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Computing PCAs</ENAMEX> from randomized
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX>-averaged data yields the distribution of the test
          statistic 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> 
          
            g 
           for each gene 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g</ENAMEX> (step <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>):
          
          We compute <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,000</NUMEX> permutation distributions for each
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX> (step <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). In step <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> we select the genes for which 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> 
          g  is greater than the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX>
          quantile of the permutation distribution of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> 
          g  . The last step is the
          visualization of the arrays and selected genes in the
          reduced 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> -components space. If 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, a twofold visualization is
          suggested. The biplot with marked selected genes can be
          used to relate genes and conditions. Genes lying near an
          axis of a condition are upregulated in this hybridization
          and genes lying in the opposite direction are repressed.
          With several conditions, this relation is generally not
          unique. Therefore, the visualization maybe supported by
          color-coded expression-profile tables. Here, the data
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">matrix</ENAMEX> is rearranged according to the angular distance
          from the 
          x -axis for each gene (rearranging 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> rows). The same is done for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridizations</ENAMEX> (rearranging 
          p columns). If 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k ></ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 several</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">biplots</ENAMEX> and
          color-coded tables must be constructed.
        
        
          Application to yeast cell-cycle data
          To demonstrate our approach, we applied it to the
          yeast cell-cycle data published by Spellman 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>]. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX>
          synchronized the yeast cell cycle using independent
          methods of cell-cycle arrest and measured the expression
          of all <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> open reading frames (ORFs) at different time
          points after the cell-cycle synchronization. They
          identified genes related to the cell cycle using Fourier
          transformation and correlation measures. We analyzed the
          cell-cycle-related genes selected by Spellman 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>] to demonstrate the
          relationship between cell-cycle phases and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-expression patterns and to select a subset of genes
          that show the highest and most reproducible variance
          across the cell-cycle phases. We analyzed the expression
          patterns of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">773</NUMEX> selected <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> over all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">73</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridizations</ENAMEX>.
          The cell cycle is a temporal continuum that is
          generally grouped into <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>-cycle phases. This
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">classification</ENAMEX> was also carried out by Spellman 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>]. The classification
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in cell-cycle phase <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> enables <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to
          analyze the variance of gene expression across the
          cell-cycle phases and to select genes with different and
          robust regulation. We analyzed the data using
          permutation-validated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCA</ENAMEX>. A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> PCA was based on the
          polished logarithmic ratios including all arrays. An
          analysis of variance (ANOVA) using the variable loadings
          as dependent variables and the classification-derived
          cell-cycle phase <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> as factors was carried out. The
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> components were highly significant whereas the
          others were not. Figure 2shows a plot of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          component loadings against each other. Of the data's
          variance, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">37.2%</NUMEX> was explained by the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">components</ENAMEX>. The plot shows that the resulting ordination
          of the hybridizations corresponds to the assignment of
          cell-cycle phases by Spellman 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>]. The angular position
          of the hybridizations in the plot reflects their correct
          temporal situation in the cycle. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> arrays
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDC</ENAMEX> series seem to be misclassified. They are
          shown with colored labels in Figure 2and show a
          counterclockwise shift in expression in the cell cycle.
          Thus, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> components approximate the cell-cycle
          aspect of the data quite well and could be interpreted as
          cell-cycle components. They reflect the main temporal
          aspect of the data.
          A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> PCA was carried out on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>-averaged
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> using the original cell-cycle classification with
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> components (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">94.4%</NUMEX> explained variance). Figure 3shows
          a biplot of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">773</NUMEX> gene scores and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> cell-cycle
          phase group loadings. For each gene the distance to the
          origin indicates the variance in the reduced
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">two-dimensional</ENAMEX> space. The hole in the middle of the plot
          reflects the fact that only genes related to the cell
          cycle were chosen by Spellman 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>]. Genes without
          variance with respect to the cell cycle (equally
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcribed</ENAMEX> in most cell-cycle phases) would lie in the
          middle of the biplot. In Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> are labeled
          with gene symbols. These genes had a test value above the
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> percentile of the permutation distribution of the
          related test statistic. Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3allows</NUMEX> the assignment of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> to the cell-cycle phases in which they are
          regulated. As illustrated by Figures <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3and 4</ENAMEX>, in the
          cell-cycle phase <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M/G1</ENAMEX>, 
          CDC46 (encoding part of the
          replication complex) was selected as an upregulated gene,
          whereas the histone genes 
          HTB2, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HTA2</ENAMEX> and 
          HHO1 (also marked by Spellman 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>] and Fellenberg 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>]) were selected as
          downregulated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. In phases <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">G1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX>, 
          POL30 (replication complex) and 
          RAD51 (cell-cycle-related protein
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kinase</ENAMEX>) were selected. The histone genes repressed in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">M/G1</ENAMEX> were upregulated in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">S.</ENAMEX> In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">G2</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX>, 
          CLB1 (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">G2/M-</ENAMEX>specific cyclin involved
          in mitotic induction), 
          CDC5 (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mitotic DNA replication</ENAMEX>) and 
          CLB2 (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">G2/M-</ENAMEX>specific cyclin involved
          in mitotic induction) were selected as upregulated, in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phase M</ENAMEX> 
          CDC20 (cyclin degradation, part of
          the anaphase-promoting complex). Thus, among the known
          genes selected by our algorithm, many play a crucial role
          in the cell cycle. As described by Spellman 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>], the microarray
          expression data confirm the results of other gene
          expression studies.
        
        
          Application to abolition of CRH-RI function
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>
          In this experiment, mRNAs from whole brains of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> of
          different genetic backgrounds which had been treated with
          an antagonist directed against the ligand-binding domain
          of a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">seven-transmembrane</NUMEX> neuropeptide <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>] (the
          corticotropin-releasing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormone receptor 1</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CRH-R1</ENAMEX>) [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX>]) were compared to mRNAs from brains of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> lacking a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">functional CRH-R1</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CRH-R1</ENAMEX> knockout <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>]) using
          cDNA-microarrays (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). The data consist of log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ratios. The matrix had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,810</NUMEX>
          complete observations (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> hybridizations. We
          computed a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCA</ENAMEX> based on the polished matrix of single
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridizations</ENAMEX> to show that the treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> members
          clustered together (data not shown). We performed an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANOVA</ENAMEX> using the variable loadings as dependent variables
          and the treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> as factors. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          components were highly significant, whereas the third
          component was not. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> components explained
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">37.5%</NUMEX> of the data's variance. We carried out <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCA</ENAMEX> for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX>-averaged data with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> components (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">54.8%</NUMEX> explained
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variance</ENAMEX>). Figure 5shows a biplot of these components.
          The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> components describe a gradient effect of the
          abolition of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CRH-R1</ENAMEX> function in different genetic
          backgrounds. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Component 1</ENAMEX> (abscissa) distinguishes the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CRH-R1</ENAMEX> abolition (null mutant) from relatively mild
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CRH-R1</ENAMEX> function impairment (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">h1</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">w1: 1 day</TIMEX> of treatment
          with antagonist). With the increasing effect on the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> of gene function impairment, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>'
          loadings on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> component become more similar to
          the genetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CRH-R1</ENAMEX> inactivation. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Component 2</ENAMEX> (ordinate)
          distinguishes between impairment of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">heterozygotes</ENAMEX> treated
          for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 day</TIMEX> and wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> treated for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7 days</TIMEX> (both
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">129Ola/CD1 background</ENAMEX>).
          Because long-term-treated wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> of 129SvJ
          background (sy) are similar to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">knockout animals</ENAMEX>,
          treatment seems to have a strong effect in these <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Animals</ENAMEX> with a <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">129Ola/CD1</ENAMEX> background (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> wy) show a
          weaker response to treatment with the antagonist. Both
          components describe abolition-of-function effects in a
          background-dependent manner. Thus, given a particular
          genetic background, treatment with an antagonist against
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CRH-R1</ENAMEX> can mimic the genetic abolition of gene function.
          A comparable phenomenon was shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hughes</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>].
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only 25</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were selected by permutation tests and
          are labeled with gene symbols in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>. These genes
          show high variance across the treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> and are
          highly reproducible. Only genes that contrast the groups
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ko</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">s7</ENAMEX> on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> side and in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">groups</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">w1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">w7</ENAMEX> on the
          other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">side</ENAMEX> are selected. The profiles of these genes are
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">illustrated</ENAMEX> in Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">6and</ENAMEX> support the interpretation of
          the biplot.
        
        
          Application to antidepressant data
          In this experiment, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29 12</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">-week-old male mice</ENAMEX> of 129SvJ
          background were treated with mirtazapine, paroxetine or
          vehicle for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1, 7 or 28 days</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). cDNA microarrays
          were used to measure the mRNA expression in total brain
          homogenates of these <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>. The data consist of log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ratios. The matrix had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,190</NUMEX>
          complete observations (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> hybridizations. We
          computed a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCA</ENAMEX> based on the polished matrix of single
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridizations</ENAMEX> to show that the treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ordinated</ENAMEX> together (data not shown). We performed an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANOVA</ENAMEX> using the variable loadings as dependent variables
          and the treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> as factors. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          components were highly significant. They explained <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">36.3%</NUMEX>
          of the data's variance and the object (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX>) scores with
          respect to these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> components were used to compute the
          variance of genes according to the group differences.
          We carried out a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCA</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>-averaged data and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">components</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">72.1%</NUMEX> explained variance). Figure 7shows a
          biplot of these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">components</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">127</NUMEX> selected <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> at the
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> percentile (labeled with numbers) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> at the
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99%</NUMEX> percentile (labeled with gene symbols). The
          components describe the effects of antidepressant
          treatment on the mouse brain. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> component
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">abscissa</NUMEX>) discerns treatment with mirtazapine (a) from
          treatment with paroxetine (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX>). This component can be
          interpreted as the drug-type effect. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> component
          discerns short (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 day</TIMEX>) from longer (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">7</ENAMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28 days</TIMEX>)
          treatment and can be interpreted as the treatment
          duration effect. Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8shows</NUMEX> the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> selected at
          the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99%</NUMEX> percentile in a color-coded expression table.
          These genes strongly reflect the treatment type and
          duration effect.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        Here we propose a method for analyzing microarray data
        with group <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> imposed by different conditions. We
        combine the visualization focused on the variance of genes
        between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> selection, taking into account the
        within<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">-group</ENAMEX> variance. Based on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCA</ENAMEX>, this method is able to
        visualize relationships between hybridizations by dimension
        reduction. Yet, data visualization via a biplot allows more
        than biological interpretation of the components. After
        appropriate data preprocessing, searching for genes with
        changes in expression patterns across the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> can be
        based on the genes' (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX>') distance from the centroid
        of the biplot. This distance is proportional to the
        variance of genes in the dimension-reduced space. A
        correspondence analysis would give a similar result [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>].
        But a selection of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> must be accompanied by an
        assessment of whether the results are statistically
        reliable relative to the level of noise in the data.
        Whereas classic statistical tests (like 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">t- and F-</ENAMEX>statistics) are based on
        assumptions concerning distribution and variable
        independence that do not hold for microarray data [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 19</ENAMEX>]
        the permutation-validation procedure presented here makes
        no assumption about the dependence of gene-expression
        measurement within the expression matrix 
        X . Therefore, gene-specific scatter is
        taken into consideration by calculating the test-value
        permutation distributions for each gene under the null
        hypothesis of no <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>-structure effect in the expression
        profiles. Another method for validating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCA</ENAMEX> results using a
        leave-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-out approach (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wall</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>]) is very global, and
        can only be applied when the conditions correspond to a
        continuous parameter, such as time or dose.
        The last step of the permutation-validated PCA procedure
        concerns the visualization and the interpretation of the
        selected genes according to their importance in a
        biological context. In the case of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> dimensions ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>), a color-coded expression
        profile can be generated by rearranging the selected genes
        and the arrays with respect to angular distances in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biplot</ENAMEX>. When looking at a biplot showing several variable
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">loadings</ENAMEX>, a given object (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX>) has to be projected on all
        different variables (conditions) to understand its pattern
        with regard to all of them. A color-coded
        expression-profile table may support this visual
        interpretation. As a further development of the method
        described here, we envisage cluster analysis of the
        selected genes for higher dimensions ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k ></ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
        The application of permutation-validated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCA</ENAMEX> to
        microarray data shows that the basic sources of variance
        could be extracted from all datasets: The components
        computed from the Spellman 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>] yeast data described
        the cell cycle and allowed ordinations of the
        hybridizations according to their temporal situation in the
        cell cycle. Arrays misclassified by the Fourier
        transformation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>] were assigned to shifted positions in
        the cell cycle (this was also achieved by correspondence
        analysis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>]). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">components</ENAMEX> computed from the abolition
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CRH-R1</ENAMEX> function experiment described a gradient of
        increasing functional impairment depending on the genetic
        background of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>. The analysis of the
        antidepressant data also shows how principal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">components</ENAMEX> led
        to an understanding of the fundamental biological phenomena
        captured by the data: here, they discern the types of
        treatment and the treatment duration.
        But there were important differences in the results:
        whereas the grouped <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCA</ENAMEX> of the cell-cycle data explained
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">94.4%</NUMEX> of the data's variance, the corresponding rates were
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">72.1%</NUMEX> explained variance for the antidepressant data and
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">54.8%</NUMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CRH-R1</ENAMEX> abolition data. In a situation with
        homogeneous array <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> and preselected <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> such as the
        cell-cycle data, the level of explained variance was very
        high as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">components</ENAMEX> explained the kind of variance the
        genes were preselected for. For the antidepressant data, no
        
        a priori information about the
        relation of genes to treatment type and duration was
        available. Thus the level of explained variance was lower
        (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">72.1%</NUMEX>), although the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> components used to build the test
        statistics still captured a big part of the variance
        present in the data. Although the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">material</ENAMEX> used for the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">antidepressant</ENAMEX> treatment data (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> from total mouse brain
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">homogenates</ENAMEX> containing a variety of cell types) was more
        heterogeneous than the clonal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> cell lines,
        antidepressant effects on the brain's mRNA transcription
        were so important that clear variance structures emerged in
        the data. In contrast, the level of explained variance for
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CRH-R1</ENAMEX> function abolition data was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">54.8%</NUMEX>. In this
        experiment, different methods of impairing or abolishing
        the function of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CRH-R1</ENAMEX> were used on different mouse genetic
        backgrounds. The variance in the experimental design was
        thus quite high. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heterogeneity</ENAMEX> within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> was also
        higher than in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the antidepressant</TIMEX> experiment, probably
        because a selective pharmacologic antagonization of the
        neuro-modulating peptide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CRH</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>] had a less pronounced
        and stereotypic effect on transcription in the brain than
        the antidepressant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> acting on a wide spectrum of
        neurotransmitter <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>, transporters and related
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enzymes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>]. In this situation of high variance in the
        experimental design, and a relatively high rate of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heterogeneity</ENAMEX> in the treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>,
        permutation-validated PCA only selected genes reflecting
        the contrast between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">groups</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">w1</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">w7</TIMEX> on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> side and s7
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">k0</ENAMEX> on the other side because this contrast was captured
        by the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> components. Other aspects of the data were
        not captured by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCA</ENAMEX>. Thus, a multivariate approach trying
        to compare very different gene expression patterns at the
        same time might lead to loss of information. In such a
        case, the selection of genes should be treated with caution
        and cross-validation by independent methods should be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">applied</ENAMEX> if hypotheses are to be derived from the selected
        genes. Pairwise comparisons of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> might be more
        appropriate in such a situation.
        In conclusion, permutation-validated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCA</ENAMEX> can be used to
        extract the leading source of variance from microarray
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>, to visualize relationships between genes and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridizations</ENAMEX> and to select informative genes in a
        statistically reliable manner. This selection accounts for
        the level of reproducibility of replicates or group
        structure as well as gene-specific scatter.

          Sample processing and hybridization
          A subset of the data from Spellman 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>] was used. To acquire
          our own data, microarrays were manufactured, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> treated
          and total brain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> extracted, labeled and hybridized as
          described in [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>]. Briefly, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were killed after the
          end of treatment, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was extracted by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNeasy</ENAMEX> and TRIZOL
          procedure. Total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">100 Î¼g</ENAMEX>) was fluorescence-labeled by
          oligo-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dT</NUMEX>-primed reverse transcription to cDNA in the
          presence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Cy3</NUMEX>-dUTP as described by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eisen</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX>]. After reverse transcription, total brain Cy3-labeled
          cDNA from each <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> was hybridized to a microarray.
          Fluorescence intensity was detected using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genetic</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microsystems GMS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">418 Array Scanner</ENAMEX>. Raw data were
          assessed with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spectrum</ENAMEX> vs.<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3.2</NUMEX> image-analysis software
          developed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chen</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX>].
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> preprocessing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> from Spellman 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>] were also used by
          Fellenberg 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>]; we did not modify
          the described preprocessing. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> datasets from our
          lab were preprocessed in the following manner. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Matrix</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rows</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>) with missing observations were excluded from
          the datasets, resulting in data without missing values.
          To normalize and compare the different hybridizations to
          each other, the intensity measured at each spot of the
          arrays was divided by the centered median of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">intensities</ENAMEX> measured at the corresponding spot in the
          reference <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. Thus, every single hybridization was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">normalized</ENAMEX> against the reference <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> by computing the
          log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> of the ratios (the mean of groups
          so, ho and wo for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CRH-R1</ENAMEX> data and group c28 for the
          antidepressant data). Therefore, these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> do not
          appear in Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5to 8</NUMEX>. Given an 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> Ã— 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> data matrix, the following model
          [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2</ENAMEX>] can be stated:
          
          X 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">gj  = Î¼ + Î±</ENAMEX> 
          
            g 
           <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">+ Î²</ENAMEX> 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">j</ENAMEX> 
           <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">+ Î´</ENAMEX> 
          
            gj 
           <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">+ Îµ</ENAMEX> 
          
            gj 
           
          In this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>, 
          X 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gi</ENAMEX>  is the log-ratio of gene 
          g under experimental condition 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">j</ENAMEX> , Î± 
          
            g 
           is the normalizing effect for gene 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">row</TIMEX>), Î² 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">j</ENAMEX> 
           is the experimental variance effect for j (column),
          Î´ 
          
            gj 
           is the differential gene expression for gene 
          g under experimental condition j
          and Îµ 
          
            gj 
           is the random error.
          To estimate the interaction term Î´ 
          
            gj 
           , several other effects must be controlled: as Î± 
          
            g 
           reflects the relation of experiment <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">normalizing RNA</ENAMEX> and is of no biological interest, it can
          be controlled by mean centering rows. Î² 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">j</ENAMEX> 
           reflects the global variance in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA preparation</ENAMEX>,
          labeling efficacy and hybridization quality as well as
          other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of experimental variance between the arrays
          and can be controlled by standardizing the matrix
          columns. Doing replicates enables control of Îµ 
          
            gj 
           . The term Î´ 
          
            gj 
           can thus be obtained by data polishing [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>], that
          is, the matrix is iteratively subjected to column
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">standardization</ENAMEX> and row mean centering until convergence
          is reached. This polished matrix was used as the basis
          for multivariate analysis.
