        Older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> are frequently counseled to lose weight,
        even though there is little evidence that <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">overweight</ENAMEX> is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with increased mortality in those over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 65</TIMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Six</NUMEX> large controlled population-based studies of
        non-smoking older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> have investigated the association
        between body mass index (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>) and mortality, controlling
        for relevant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">covariates</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3 4 5 6</NUMEX> ] . All studies found
        excess risk for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> with very low <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>, but that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX>
        with moderately high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> had little or no extra risk except
        in certain small subsets. A review of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> studies of older
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> drew similar conclusions [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] .
        Many healthy older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> report gradual weight gain
        throughout adult life. It may be that a small amount of
        gradual weight gain is normative and associated with the
        most robust health as we age. It has been suggested that
        weight standards be adjusted upwards for age [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . Such
        recommendations remain controversial, however, because the
        number of studies of older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> is fairly small, and
        because few studies have examined the relation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> to
        quality of life or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> of healthy life (YHL) in the
        elderly [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] .
        In older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>, risk factors may have a greater effect
        on health than on mortality. If so, then behavior change
        trials of weight modification might be more successful if
        they were evaluated on improved health, rather than on
        decreased mortality. Clinical trials powered to detect
        differences in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YHL</ENAMEX> would often require fewer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> than
        trials to detect survival differences or cardiovascular
        events [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . In this paper we study whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> at
        baseline is associated with living longer, and/or with more
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> of being healthy, in a cohort of older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> for
        whom risk factors, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">subclinical disease</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">morbidity</ENAMEX> are
        well characterized. The goal is to determine whether
        analyses based on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> of life (YOL) or on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YHL</ENAMEX> would
        provide substantively different results, and which measure
        would yield more powerful evaluations of weight
        modification interventions in older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Materials and methods
        
          Study design: The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cardiovascular Health</ENAMEX>
          Study
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cardiovascular Health Study</ENAMEX> (CHS) is a
          population-based longitudinal study of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,888</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> aged
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">65 and older</TIMEX> at baseline [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Subjects</ENAMEX> were recruited
          from a random sample of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medicare</ENAMEX> eligibility lists in
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">counties</ENAMEX>. Extensive baseline data were collected
          for all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> using a baseline home interview, an
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> mail questionnaire, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> clinic
          examinations. Additional information was collected in a
          brief telephone interview <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6 months</TIMEX> after each scheduled
          visit. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cohorts</ENAMEX> were followed, one with 7 years of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">follow-up</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,201</NUMEX>) and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> (all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">African</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">687</NUMEX>) with 4 years of follow-up to date.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> collection began in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX>, and follow-up is virtually
          complete for all surviving <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] .
        
        
          Body mass index
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> was calculated as measured weight in <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kilograms</NUMEX>
          divided by the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square</ENAMEX> of measured height in <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">meters</NUMEX>. A
          report from the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">National Heart Lung and Blood Institute</ENAMEX>
          classifies normal weight (without reference to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX>) as a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18.5</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24.9</NUMEX>; overweight <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as 25 to 29.9</NUMEX>; and
          obesity as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30.0</NUMEX> and higher [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . We consider
          separately the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between 18.5 and 20</NUMEX>, which
          was associated with lower survival in studies cited
          above.
        
        
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Years</TIMEX> of life and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> of healthy life
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YOL</ENAMEX> is the number of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> lived in the
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7 years</TIMEX> after baseline. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YHL</ENAMEX> is the number of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> in
          which the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> was 'healthy', and is similar in concept
          to quality-adjusted life-years, healthy year equivalents,
          or active life expectancy [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . We based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YHL</ENAMEX> on
          self-rated health (is your health excellent, very good,
          good, fair, or poor?) (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EVGFP</ENAMEX>) which was collected every <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EVGFP</ENAMEX> is a simple but well-known measure, which
          has been studied in detail [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16</NUMEX> ] , and is predictive
          of health events in many studies [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . Because we are
          examining health status over time, we added <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a sixth</NUMEX>
          health <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, dead. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> were available <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 93%</NUMEX> of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>. We used linear interpolation to estimate missing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> when there were known values before and after the
          missing value, bringing the percent complete to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>
          ] .
          For this analysis we defined <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YHL</ENAMEX> as the number of
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> (of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>) in which a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> reported excellent, very
          good, or good health (were 'healthy'). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YHL</ENAMEX> ranges from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>
          (for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> who were never in excellent, very good, or
          good health) to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7 years</TIMEX> (for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> who were healthy
          throughout). Since <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX> reported their health every <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YHL</ENAMEX> has a reasonably continuous distribution. A
          drawback of this simple definition of 'healthy' is that
          it does not distinguish between fair or poor health and
          death, since all are considered 'not healthy'. We also
          used an alternative approach, which assigns a different
          value to each level of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EVGFP</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . Preliminary results
          were similar for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> approaches, however, and we
          report results using only the simpler definition.
          The calculations had to be modified to include the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">438</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cohort</ENAMEX>, who have
          been followed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">only 4 years to date</TIMEX>. For those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX>,
          and for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cohort</ENAMEX> who did not have
          complete data, we estimated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last 4 years</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YOL</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YHL</ENAMEX> from their age, sex, and health at the end of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, using validated methods presented elsewhere [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ]
          . That article showed that estimated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4-year</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YOL</ENAMEX> and YHL
          were unbiased for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">African American</ENAMEX> cohort. In the
          primary analysis we used observed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7-year</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YOL</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YHL</ENAMEX> when
          they were available, and observed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3-year</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YOL</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YHL</ENAMEX> plus
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4-year</TIMEX> estimated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YOL</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YHL</ENAMEX> when they were not (about
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> of the sample). We performed all analyses with and
          without the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> who had partially estimated data, to
          ensure that the estimation had not distorted the
          findings.
        
        
          Covariates
          The goal is to examine the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YOL</ENAMEX> and YHL
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>. To adjust for possible confounding we chose
          baseline covariates that were prevalent in the elderly,
          related to mortality and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">morbidity</ENAMEX> in previous studies,
          and likely to be related to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>. Self-reported covariates
          include age, gender, smoking (never or former), history
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>, fair or poor self-rated
          health status, limitations in activities of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> living
          or in instrumental activities of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> living, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          pounds or more unintended weight loss in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the year</TIMEX> before
          baseline. Clinical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">covariates</ENAMEX> include <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hypertension</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cardiovascular disease</ENAMEX> (prevalent <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">heart disease</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">peripheral vascular disease</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cerebrovascular disease</ENAMEX>),
          maximum thickness of the internal carotid <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">artery</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">depression</ENAMEX> (CESD score), serum albumin, serum
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX>, and serum creatinine. These measures are
          explained in more detail elsewhere [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 22 23 24</NUMEX> ] . We
          excluded <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">697</NUMEX> current <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">smokers</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">313</NUMEX> others with
          incomplete covariate data, leaving <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,878</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> on whom
          this analysis is based.
        
        
          Analysis
          All analyses were performed separately for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. We calculated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sets of adjusted values, as
          follows. We regressed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YOL</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YHL</ENAMEX> first on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX>, age
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">squared</ENAMEX>, race, and smoking history (former or never), and
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> on all of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">covariates</ENAMEX> listed above. We
          calculated adjusted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YOL</ENAMEX> as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>'s observed YOL minus
          predicted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YOL</ENAMEX> (from the regression) plus the mean YOL
          (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6.52 years</TIMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">6.06</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>). That is, a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>'s adjusted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YOL</ENAMEX> is his residual from the regression
          plus the grand mean. The mean of this new variable, for a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> of subjects, is the adjusted mean <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YOL</ENAMEX> for that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX>. Adjusted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YHL</ENAMEX> was calculated in a similar manner.
          We calculated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sets of adjusted variables because of
          the possibility of 'over-adjustment', controlling
          inappropriately for factors (such as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diabetes</ENAMEX>) which may
          have been causally affected by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX>'s weight. We
          plotted mean adjusted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YOL</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YHL</ENAMEX> against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>, and tested
          for difference among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> using confidence
          intervals or analysis of variance. Finally we calculated
          the effect size for each measure, comparing each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subgroup</ENAMEX> to the 'normal' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. The effect size is the
          difference in mean <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YOL</ENAMEX> (or YHL) in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> divided by
          their common standard deviation. Since the sample size
          required to detect an effect of this magnitude is
          proportional to the inverse of the squared effect size,
          large effect sizes are desirable.
        
      
      
        Results
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1shows</ENAMEX> the distribution of key variables by sex
        and race. Mean age at baseline was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">73.1</NUMEX> and about two
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">thirds</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a third</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> were former
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">smokers</ENAMEX>. Black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> had a higher mean <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> and higher
        percent obese (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI â</ENAMEX>‰<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">¥ 30</NUMEX>) than the other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. Black
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> were most likely to have unintentionally lost more than
        <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 pounds</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past year</TIMEX>; white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> were least
        likely.
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">About 78%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> were healthy at baseline,
        declining to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">57%</NUMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of 7 years</TIMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> had died (data
        not shown). Of the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">22%</NUMEX> who were unhealthy (fair or poor) at
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">baseline</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 24%</NUMEX> were healthy <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7 years later</TIMEX>. There was
        thus substantial change in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EVGFP</ENAMEX> over time, in both
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">directions</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1shows</ENAMEX> the mean <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YOL</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YHL</ENAMEX> (calculated
        from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EVGFP</ENAMEX>) in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first seven years</TIMEX> of the study, adjusted
        to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 73</TIMEX>. For example, black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> averaged <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YOL</ENAMEX>, but
        only <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YHL</ENAMEX> of a maximum possible <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>. We calculated some
        additional descriptive statistics, shown in the final <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two</TIMEX>
        lines: years of unhealthy life (YOL minus YHL) and years
        lost to death (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">7 minus</NUMEX> YOL). White <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> had the most YHL
        and black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> the fewest; black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> had <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the most years</TIMEX> of
        unhealthy life, and white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> the fewest; black <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> lost
        the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">most years</TIMEX> to death (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.3</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>) while white women
        lost <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 0.4</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>. For <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 68%</NUMEX> of their YOL
        were healthy (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YHL/YOL</ENAMEX>, not shown); for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 75%</NUMEX>
        were healthy.
        Among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX>, the gender differences in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX> 1were
        statistically significant (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"><.05</NUMEX>) except for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> and
        unintended weight loss. Among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX>, gender differences
        were significant except for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> pounds unintended weight
        loss and weight loss since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 50</TIMEX>. Among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX>, there were
        significant differences between black and white for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>,
        unintended weight loss, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YOL</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YHL</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> of unhealthy life,
        and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> lost to death. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Whites</ENAMEX> in the sample had higher
        income and education (data not shown). After adjusting for
        income and education, as well as age and former smoking,
        the difference in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> was no longer statistically
        significant. Among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX> differed
        significantly on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI></ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>, weight loss since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 50</TIMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YOL</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YHL</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> of unhealthy life, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> lost to death.
        After adjustment for income and education, the difference
        in weight loss since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 50</TIMEX> was no longer significant.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Blacks</ENAMEX> had significantly lower <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YOL</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YHL</ENAMEX> than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX>
        after adjustment for age, but the difference disappeared
        after adjustment for the entire set of health-related
        baseline covariates (analyses not shown).
        We next examined the relationship of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YOL</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YHL</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2presents</ENAMEX> the mean values of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YOL</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YHL</ENAMEX>, adjusted
        for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX>, race, and previous smoking (columns <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 and 3</NUMEX>), and
        also adjusted for the entire set of covariates (columns 2
        and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YOL</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, adjusted for age, race,
        and smoking, averaged <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6.0 years</TIMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> with a baseline
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> below <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">18.5</NUMEX>, but averaged <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6.6 years</TIMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>
        from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">25 to 29.9</NUMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> column, which shows results
        adjusted for all covariates, is not very different (the
        only discrepancy is for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18.5</NUMEX>, a category
        containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 14</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>). Adjustment for extensive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">covariates</ENAMEX> also made little difference for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YHL</ENAMEX> (columns 3
        and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). Subsequent analyses are adjusted only for age,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">race</ENAMEX>, and former smoking. As mentioned above, the group
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18.5 to 20</NUMEX> would be considered 'normal' by
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NHLBI</ENAMEX> guidelines, but had lower <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YOL</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YHL</ENAMEX> than those
        with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24.9</NUMEX> in all comparisons. For this reason, and to
        increase sample size for those with low <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>, we combined
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> lower categories, defining underweight as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>
        under <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>.
        Figure 1is a plot of adjusted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YOL</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YHL</ENAMEX> by sex and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX>. For each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> category the mean and its <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> confidence
        interval are plotted. Categories whose confidence intervals
        do not overlap, or overlap only slightly, are significantly
        different. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bars</ENAMEX> are slightly offset to permit all error
        bars to be seen.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YOL</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> (the uppermost curve on Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) averaged
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 6.5</NUMEX> out of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7 years</TIMEX>, and showed no evident association
        between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YOL</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> above <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Underweight</ENAMEX> women
        averaged <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about .25</NUMEX> fewer <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">YOL</ENAMEX> than other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.05</NUMEX>
        compared with normal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Underweight</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> also had lower
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YOL</ENAMEX>, but this group was not significantly different from
        the normal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, in part because of low sample size. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Men</ENAMEX>
        classified as normal, overweight or obese all had about the
        same YOL.
        The lowermost <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> lines in Figure 1show mean <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YHL</ENAMEX> for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Women</ENAMEX> who were normal or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">overweight</ENAMEX> averaged
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 4.9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YHL</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YHL</ENAMEX> for underweight or obese <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> was
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about 4.5 years</TIMEX>, which was significantly lower than the
        normal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. The relationship of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YHL</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> is
        similar, but differences among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> were not
        statistically significant. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YHL</ENAMEX> was significantly higher for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> than for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> in the normal and overweight <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">groups</ENAMEX>, but
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sexes</ENAMEX> had similar <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">YHL</ENAMEX> in the underweight and obese
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>.
        We next present the effect size for comparing each group
        to the normal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. The effect sizes are shown in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>, with the significance results of the associated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX>-tests for the differences in means of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> groups
        being compared. For example, underweight <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> averaged
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.50</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YHL</ENAMEX> compared to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4.92</NUMEX> for normal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, and the common
        standard deviation was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.44</NUMEX>. The effect size is thus
        (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.92</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.50</NUMEX>)<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">/1.44</NUMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.29</NUMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> had significantly
        different <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YHL</ENAMEX>, implying that the effect size is also
        significantly greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>. A clinical trial of a
        treatment to help underweight <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> achieve normal weight
        (presumably by addressing the underlying cause) could be
        expected to have <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX> power with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> = (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.96</NUMEX>+<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.84</NUMEX>) <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2/.29 2</TIMEX>=
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 93</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> per treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX>, if <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7-year</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YHL</ENAMEX> were the
        outcome measure.
        The biggest effect sizes are in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the first row</TIMEX>, comparing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">underweight</ENAMEX> to normal. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YHL</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YOL</ENAMEX> have similar effect
        sizes for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, and are significantly different from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>.
        The effect sizes are not significantly different from zero
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>, in part because there were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 42</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> in the
        underweight category. The effect size comparing overweight
        to normal yielded small, non-significant effect sizes, with
        inconsistent signs, suggesting extremely large sample sizes
        would be needed. For comparing obese to normal, only YHL
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> showed a large and significant effect size. Thus,
        an intervention to improve the health of underweight women
        to that of their normal weight <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peers</ENAMEX> could be performed
        using either <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">YHL</ENAMEX> or YOL as the outcome variable. Trials to
        make obese <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> comparable to normal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> could be
        evaluated using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YHL</ENAMEX>, but not YOL. Trials to improve the
        health of the other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> to that of the normals would
        probably be fruitless since there is no evidence that being
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">overweight</ENAMEX> (for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>) or obese (for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>) affects
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YOL</ENAMEX> or YHL.
        As mentioned above, we repeated these analyses excluding
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> with partially estimated data, and using two
        different ways of coding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YHL</ENAMEX>. The only substantive change
        was that some of the differences between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blacks</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">whites</ENAMEX>
        shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1were</ENAMEX> no longer statistically significant,
        due to a smaller sample size.
      
      
        Discussion
        
          Optimal weight and overweight
          Recent studies have defined obesity without reference
          to age [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6 13 30</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andres</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> proposed a desirable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMI of</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24-30</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> aged <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60 to 69</TIMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . Allison 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] proposed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27-30</NUMEX> for
          older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30-35</NUMEX> for older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. In Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">overweight</ENAMEX> (as opposed to the obese) are no different
          from those of normal weight, suggesting that these two
          categories could be combined for older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>. Since
          future improvements in life expectancy may be limited [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX> ] , the greatest advances may be made by improving
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">people</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YHL</ENAMEX>. This suggests that the development of
          future guidelines should take <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YHL</ENAMEX> or other measures of
          quality of life into account.
        
        
          Implications for clinical trials
          Based on these findings, trials to address obesity in
          older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> could be efficient if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YHL</ENAMEX> (but not YOL) was
          the outcome measure. That is, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> who changed from
          being obese to being normal would likely show changes in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YHL</ENAMEX>, but not YOL. Clinical trials of weight modification
          interventions for older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> who were merely overweight
          would appear to be fruitless since the interventions
          would probably not have a direct effect on either <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">YOL</ENAMEX> or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YHL</ENAMEX>.
          Weight or weight change are sometimes used as the
          outcome in evaluations of interventions such as diet or
          exercise programs. The fact that weight is not associated
          in a consistent way with health suggests that such
          evaluations should be considered critically when older
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> are the subjects. This is particularly important
          in the light of recent findings, which found that
          interventions such as weight-loss <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> may be harmful [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33 34</NUMEX> ] . For older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>, the risks associated with
          higher weight are especially unclear, and the optimal
          outcome for a trial of weight loss in older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>
          requires specific attention to improved health and
          mortality.
          Interestingly, the strongest health relationships were
          found for underweight older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>. Clinical trials whose
          objective was to make the underweight as healthy as their
          normal-weight <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peers</ENAMEX> (presumably by addressing the
          underlying conditions that caused the low weight) could
          be performed efficiently using either <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">YOL</ENAMEX> or YHL as the
          outcome measure. Both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YOL</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YHL</ENAMEX> would be clinically
          significant in this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient group</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Potential limitations
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> were somewhat healthier than the
          average older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult</ENAMEX>; however, adjustment for detailed
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">covariates</ENAMEX> made little difference in the findings. We
          estimated the last <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four years</TIMEX> of health data for about
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> of the sample, but results with and without this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> were similar. Analysis of mean <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YOL</ENAMEX> instead of the
          more traditional survival analysis survival analysis was
          appropriate here, since virtually no <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX> were lost to
          follow-up. Biases caused by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-adjustment are probably
          not large, since the findings were not sensitive to the
          number of variables adjusted for.
          These results are for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a 7-year</TIMEX> follow-up. The relative
          superiority of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YHL</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YOL</ENAMEX> would probably hold in trials
          with shorter follow-up. The effect sizes in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX> 3might
          also be appropriate in shorter trials, since lengthy
          trials often add little information [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] .
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EVGFP</ENAMEX>, on which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YHL</ENAMEX> was based, might have missed some
          effects of obesity on risk factors for future health. A
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> who is depressed because of a poor self-image
          related to obesity or who has osteo-<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arthritis</ENAMEX> related to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">obesity</ENAMEX> and limits to activities to successfully avoid
          pain would surely have worse EVGFP than others, based on
          results from many studies. However, health measures
          designed specifically to measure those conditions might
          be more sensitive to change in weight than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EVGFP</ENAMEX>. If YHL
          were based on such measures, the superiority of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YHL</ENAMEX> to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YOL</ENAMEX> would likely be even greater than that shown here.
          These more sensitive measures might also have detected
          differences between the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">overweight</ENAMEX> and normal weight
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">persons</ENAMEX>, but we think this is unlikely given the absence
          of any differences in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EVGFP</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Conclusion
        Recommendations for desirable weight have been
        criticized for emphasizing mortality rather than health. We
        found <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YHL</ENAMEX> and obesity that were not
        present in the mortality analysis, suggesting that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YHL</ENAMEX> may
        be a more sensitive measure of the burden of obesity in
        older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>, especially for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. Future efforts to
        determine desirable weight guidelines should include
        measures of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YHL</ENAMEX>. Using either <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">YOL</ENAMEX> or YHL, however, we found
        no excess risk for older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> who would be classified as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'overweight</ENAMEX>' by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NHLBI</ENAMEX> guidelines. This suggests using
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YHL</ENAMEX> as the outcome measure in clinical trials involving
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">obese</ENAMEX> or underweight older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>, and discouraging trials
        that address older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> who are merely <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">overweight</ENAMEX>.
