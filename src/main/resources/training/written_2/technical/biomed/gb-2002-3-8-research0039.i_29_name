        The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> and dynamics of chromatin clearly
        differentiate the eukaryotes from the other superkingdoms
        of life [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2</ENAMEX>]. Eukaryotic chromatin undergoes a variety
        of structural and compositional changes that accompany the
        progression of the cell cycle and changes in gene
        expression [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>]. These dynamics are regulated both by a
        variety of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-protein</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-DNA interactions</ENAMEX> and
        by catalytic modification and reorganization of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nucleic acids</ENAMEX> that comprise the chromosomes [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>]. In
        recent <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> it has become clear that covalent modification
        of histones, transcription factors and other chromosomal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> plays a major part in the dynamics of chromatin.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">covalent</ENAMEX> modifications include hydroxylation of proline
        and lysine, methylation of lysine and arginine,
        phosphorylation of serine and threonine, and acetylation
        and ubiquitination of lysine. Other enzymes, such as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">deacetylases</ENAMEX> and phosphatases, remove covalent
        modifications from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and thus reverse their effects
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4, 5, 6</ENAMEX>]. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">covalent</ENAMEX> modifications may change the local
        or global charge properties of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chromosomal proteins</ENAMEX> and
        regulate their interactions with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>. Additionally, the
        modifications also seem to form a 'code' that is recognized
        by specific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6, 7, 8</ENAMEX>].
        Besides <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">covalent</ENAMEX> modifications, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>-dependent enzymes such
        as the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Swi2/Snf2 ATPases</ENAMEX> and other chaperone-like proteins
        remodel the chromatin by rearranging the binding pattern of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">histones</ENAMEX> and other chromosomal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9, 10, 11, 12</TIMEX>].
        These covalent and non-covalent catalytic actions on the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chromatin</ENAMEX> can result in condensation or decondensation of
        chromatin, either locally or on the chromosomal scale, and
        thereby regulate access of transcription factors and other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> to the chromatin.
        Many of these chromatin-modifying activities are
        organized into large multisubunit <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX>, with the core
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">enzyme</ENAMEX> accompanied by several noncatalytic subunits [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>].
        The subunits of these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> are characterized by a
        number of conserved domains that interact with other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>. Most of these domains are evolutionarily
        mobile modules and combine with each other in a very wide
        range of domain architectures [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>]. Well studied examples
        of these are the bromodomain that interacts with acetylated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">peptides</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14, 15, 16</TIMEX>], chromodomains that mediate specific
        interactions with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17, 18</TIMEX>] and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19, 20</TIMEX>], the
        PHD finger mediating <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-protein interactions</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>],
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Myb</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SANT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">domains</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>] that interact with both DNA
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>], and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAP</ENAMEX> and AT-hook domains that
        interact with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24, 25</TIMEX>]. These domains often occur
        together in large <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> linked to catalytic domains and
        may serve to tether these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> to different components
        of chromatin and deliver catalytic activities to specific
        locations.
        The computational analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chromatin proteins</ENAMEX> has
        helped in the identification of a large number of conserved
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">modules</ENAMEX> in the chromosomal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>]. These studies,
        followed by biochemical and structural characterization of
        these modules has thrown considerable light on the biology
        of chromatin dynamics and the roles these domains have
        played in course of evolution [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14, 15, 16, 20</TIMEX>]. Using
        computational analysis, we have discovered a previously
        uncharacterized domain in multiple chromatin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. We
        also show that this domain is found linked to catalytic
        domains such as oxidoreductase and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jun</ENAMEX> activating binding
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein 1</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JAB</ENAMEX>) domains and these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> may define a
        novel class of chromatin-modifying enzymes.
      
      
        Results and discussion
        
          Identification of the SWIRM domain
          In the course of our systematic survey of eukaryotic
          chromosomal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, we observed a conserved globular
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">module</ENAMEX> shared by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the SWI3p</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RSC8p proteins</ENAMEX> from the
          yeast 
          Saccharomyces cerevisiae that did
          not map to any previously characterized domain. These
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">homologous proteins</ENAMEX> are parts of the multisubunit <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">SWI</ENAMEX>/SNF
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> that drive chromatin remodeling through
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">SNF2/SWI2</ENAMEX>-like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATPase</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subunit</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26, 27, 28</TIMEX>]. The
          region of similarity encompassing this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> has been
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">termed 'conserved</ENAMEX> region <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1</TIMEX>' in [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>]. Both these proteins
          additionally contain a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Myb</ENAMEX>-related helix-turn-helix
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">domain</ENAMEX> termed the SANT domain [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>] at their carboxyl
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">terminus</ENAMEX> and a further carboxy-terminal conserved
          α-helical extension restricted to orthologs of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RSC8p</ENAMEX> and
          SWI3p. Given that these subunits are key components of
          the respective chromatin-remodeling <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX>, and
          mediate multiple interactions, we sought to further
          investigate the provenance of their conserved
          amino-terminal module using computational methods. A
          PSI-BLAST search [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>] initiated with this region from
          RSC8p (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">gi: 14318562</ENAMEX>, region <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80-177</NUMEX>) not only recovered
          its paralogs and orthologs from other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> such as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moira</ENAMEX> from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>] and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BAF155</ENAMEX> and
          BAF170 from vertebrates [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>], but also several other
          uncharacterized <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> from diverse eukaryotes with
          statistically significant expected values ( 
          e -values) at the point of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">detection</ENAMEX>. For example, the search recovered the nuclear
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">protein SPAC23E2.02</ENAMEX> from 
          Schizosaccharomyces pombe [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX>] in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">iteration 4</ENAMEX> ( 
          e = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> × <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 -4</NUMEX>), the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>
          KIAA1915 ( 
          e = <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 -5</NUMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">KIAA0601</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32, 33</TIMEX>] (
          
          e = <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 -7</NUMEX>) in iteration <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> and the 
          Arabidopsis thaliana protein
          At2g47620 in iteration 3 ( 
          e = <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 -7</NUMEX>). We prepared a multiple
          alignment of these <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> from all the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> detected
          in these searches (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) and used it to construct a
          PSI-BLAST position-specific score matrix (PSSM) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX>] and
          a hidden <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Markov</ENAMEX> model [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX>] for further searches against
          the complete or nearly complete proteome databases of
          individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">eukaryotes</ENAMEX>. These searches allowed us to
          detect additional copies of this region in the carboxyl
          termini of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asynaptic</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> (a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Hop1p</NUMEX> homolog) from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX>]. Additionally these searches also recovered
          a conserved globular region in the extreme carboxyl
          terminus of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">ADA2</NUMEX>-like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> from eukaryotes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX>],
          with moderate significance. While these newly detected
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> have a somewhat distinct conservation pattern
          from the originally detected set (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>), their
          secondary structure predicted using the JPred program [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38</NUMEX>] closely matches that predicted for the originally
          detected set. This observation, together with the
          information that the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">ADA2</NUMEX>-like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are chromatinic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX>, just like the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the original set,
          suggests that these domains are probably distant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> of each other (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
          The conserved region described above occurred in
          various distinct domain-architecture contexts, suggesting
          that it is an evolutionarily mobile domain (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). We
          named this domain the SWIRM domain after the proteins
          SWI3p, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rsc8p</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moira</ENAMEX> in which it was <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> recognized.
          Secondary-structure predictions, based on the multiple
          alignment, indicate the presence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> distinct a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">helices</ENAMEX>. Hence, it is predicted that the SWIRM domain is
          likely to form a globular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> in the form of a
          tetrahelical bundle (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). However, a direct
          comparison showed no specific relationship between the
          sequence conservation pattern of the SWIRM domain and
          those of other α-helical bundles that are commonly
          encountered in chromosomal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> such as the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bromodomain</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>], the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Myb</ENAMEX> or SANT domains and other
          helical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA-binding domains</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>]. The differences in
          conservation pattern between the distantly related ADA2p
          carboxy-terminal domains and the canonical SWIRM domains
          suggest that the former are likely to interact with a
          very distinct set of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partners</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Functional implications and domain architectures of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SWIRM</ENAMEX> domains
          Rsc8p (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Swh3p</NUMEX>) has been shown to mediate multiple
          interactions in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RSC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>: it undergoes
          dimerization via the carboxy-terminal coiled-coil
          segment, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">associates</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">SWI2/SNF2 ATPase</ENAMEX> Sth1p by
          forming <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> distinct contacts, and it forms a complex
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RSC6p</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">subunit</ENAMEX>. Deletion analyses have shown that the
          region of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> that includes the SWIRM domain is
          probably required for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> of the contacts with
          Sth1p and perhaps even those with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rsc6p</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39, 40</TIMEX>]. This
          suggests that the SWIRM domain is most likely to mediate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-protein interactions</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Rsc8p</NUMEX>- and
          SWI3p-related <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> have fairly complex architectures,
          implying that the different modules may mediate distinct
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interactions</ENAMEX>. Rsc8p has an additional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ZZ</ENAMEX> domain [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX>]
          between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SWIRM</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Myb</ENAMEX> domains, whereas the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> and
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dictyostelium</ENAMEX> versions, like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moira</ENAMEX>,
          have an additional amino-terminal chromodomain (Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). However, the common denominator in all these proteins
          are the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SWIRM</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Myb</ENAMEX> domains, suggesting that they
          mediate the evolutionarily conserved interactions of
          these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, such as those with the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Swi2/Snf2 ATPase</ENAMEX>.
          The presence of a divergent SWIRM domain, linked to a
          HORMA domain, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Asy1</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> ortholog of the yeast
          Hop1p [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX>], is consistent with the role of these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in mediating <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-protein interactions</ENAMEX> in the
          process of chromosome synapsis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX>]. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">ADA2p</NUMEX>-like
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX>] (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) are chromatin-associated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and are known to mediate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-protein
          interactions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>]. They contain a distinct
          carboxy-terminal globular domain that is distantly
          related to the SWIRM domain, suggesting that this domain
          could mediate a subset of their interactions with the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">transcriptional</ENAMEX> machinery.
          A striking <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with the SWIRM domain is
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> typified by SPAC23E2.02 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SPBC146.09c</ENAMEX> from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> pombe. Between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one and four</NUMEX>
          orthologs of this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> are encoded by different
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">crown-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> eukaryotes (Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) and contain the
          SWIRM domain linked to a predicted FAD-dependent
          oxidoreductase domain [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX>]. A similar observation
          regarding the presence of a FAD-binding domain has been
          reported for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">KIAA0601</TIMEX>, a vertebrate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> of this
          family [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32, 33</TIMEX>]. KIAA0601, along with the co-repressor
          CoREST, is stably associated with the histone deacetylase
          complex. Furthermore, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SPAC23E2.02</ENAMEX> has been shown to be a
          nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX>] and along with its paralog
          SPBC146.09c, contains at its extreme carboxyl terminus an
          HMG1 domain, which is a common <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA-binding module</ENAMEX> found
          in diverse chromosomal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX>] (Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). The
          closest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> of the predicted oxidoreductase domains
          linked to the SWIRM domain are the polyamine oxidases and
          the monoamine oxidases (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). These enzymes are
          involved in the oxidation of amino <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of polyamines
          such as spermine and spermidine and monoamines such as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dopamine</ENAMEX> and serotonin [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX>]. The availability of the
          crystal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> for the polyamine oxidase from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">maize</ENAMEX>
          allowed us to evaluate the sequence conservation of the
          oxidoreductase domain fused to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SWIRM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">domains</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46</NUMEX>]. The alignment of this domain from the
          SPAC23E2<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.02</NUMEX>-like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> spans the entire length of the
          amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxidase</ENAMEX> and contains the hallmark <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> required
          to bind the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">FAD cofactor</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). These include the
          glycine-rich loop bounded by a β-strand and an a helix
          that is typical of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rossmann</ENAMEX> fold nucleotide-binding
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX>, a conserved glutamate specific to the amino
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">oxidase</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, that interacts with ribose in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">FAD</ENAMEX> and
          other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> of the substrate and cofactor-binding
          site. Thus, these oxidoreductase domains are likely to
          function as amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxidases</ENAMEX>; this, together with their
          linkage within the same polypeptide to domains typical of
          chromatin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, and evidence for nuclear
          localization, suggests that they are novel
          chromatin-modifying enzymes. Consistent with this, the
          complex containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">KIAA0601</ENAMEX> has been shown to contain FAD
          and was suggested to be a chromatin-modifying enzyme [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX>]. Building on these observations, we suggest two
          functional possibilities for these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>: <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>, they
          could act as novel <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-modifying enzymes that oxidize
          the amino <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of lysines or arginines present on
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">histones</ENAMEX> or transcription factors; alternatively they
          could affect chromatin structure by oxidizing basic
          polyamines present in the chromatin and thereby reducing
          the charge balance.
          It is also conceivable that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAD</ENAMEX> cofactor of these
          enzymes functions analogously to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NAD</ENAMEX>, in a deacetylation
          reaction of acetyllysines similar to that carried out by
          Sir2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enzymes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX>]. Whereas both these enzymes are
          derived versions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rossmann</ENAMEX> fold and bind a
          dinucleotide cofactor, the SWIRM amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxidase proteins</ENAMEX>
          do not possess equivalents of the unique inserts with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> that allow the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">SIR2</NUMEX>-like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> to catalyze
          the deacetylation reaction. On the contrary, the
          conserved <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> in the SWIRM amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxidases</ENAMEX> are the
          same as other amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxidases</ENAMEX>, suggesting that they share
          similar catalytic activities, as proposed above.
          The combination with the SWIRM domain, which is
          predicted to be a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-protein interaction module</ENAMEX>,
          suggests that these enzymes may be part of a larger
          complex, like other chromatin-modifying enzymes. Whereas
          in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">vertebrates KIAA0601</TIMEX> has been shown to interact with
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">histone-deacetylase</ENAMEX>-containing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32, 33</TIMEX>],
          the presence of multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> could
          point to the formation of other distinct <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX>.
          Interestingly, the SWIRM amino-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">oxidase</NUMEX>-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are
          absent in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> cerevisiae but present in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> pombe and other crown-group
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eukaryotes</ENAMEX>. Hence, it is likely to have been present in
          the ancestral crown<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">-group</ENAMEX> eukaryote and secondarily lost
          in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> cerevisiae. We have shown
          previously that several functionally linked genes,
          encoding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> involved in chromatin-structure
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dynamics</ENAMEX>, which are conserved in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> pombe and other crown-group
          eukaryotes, have been lost as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> cerevisiae [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX>]. This implies
          that the SWIRM amino-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">oxidase</NUMEX>-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> may be
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">functionally</ENAMEX> linked to these other genes that were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">co</ENAMEX>-eliminated along with it in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> cerevisiae. These include genes
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> such as the SET domain methyltransferase
          Clr4p, the chromodomain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein Swi6p</ENAMEX>, the PHD finger
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein Mlo2p</ENAMEX>, the chromosomal actin-like protein
          SPAC23D3<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.09</NUMEX>, and the predicted prolylhydroxylase with the
          double-stranded β-helix domain <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SPAC343.11c</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX>]. Some of
          these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> may be part of a multiprotein
          chromatin-modifying catalytic complex of which the SWIRM
          amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxidase proteins</ENAMEX> are a part.
          In vertebrates, the SWIRM domain is found fused along
          with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Myb</ENAMEX> (SANT) domain to a <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">JAB1/PAD1</ENAMEX> domain [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48, 49</TIMEX>]
          (for example, in the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein KIAA1915</ENAMEX>, Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
          This latter domain is commonly associated with several
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteasomal</ENAMEX> and signalosomal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and is involved in
          ubiquitin-mediated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein degradation</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX>]. In this
          case, the SWIRM domain may serve to recruit proteasomal
          complexes to specific chromatin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> to effect their
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">degradation</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        We define a conserved domain of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 85</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>,
        predicted to participate in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-protein interactions</ENAMEX>,
        in different eukaryotic chromatin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> such as Swi3p
        and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Rsc8p</TIMEX>. Homologs of these molecules, with the SWIRM
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">domain</ENAMEX>, are found in all <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">eukaryotes</ENAMEX> belonging to the crown
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX>, as well as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX>-branching protists such as the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apicomplexans</ENAMEX>. A version of the SWIRM domain is found
        linked to an amino-oxidase domain in a class of nuclear
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that are represented in most crown-group
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eukaryotes</ENAMEX>. These <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are present in multiple copies
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> proteomes and are entirely absent in the yeast 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> cerevisiae. We predict that these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> define a new class of chromatin-modifying enzymes
        that are likely to oxidize the amino <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of histones or
        other nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. Alternatively, they may oxidize
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polyamines</ENAMEX> in chromatin to alter the charge balance in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chromatin</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> the SWIRM domain is found linked to a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">JAB1/PAD1</ENAMEX> catalytic domain, suggesting that this protein
        may serve as a link in the regulation of chromatinic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> through proteasomal degradation.
      
      
        Materials and methods
        The nonredundant (NR) database of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> sequences
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Center for Biotechnology Information</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIH</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bethesda</ENAMEX>) was searched using the BLASTP program. Profile
        searches were carried out using the PSI-BLAST program [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>]
        with either a single sequence or an alignment used as the
        query, with a profile inclusion expectation ( 
        E ) value threshold of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.01</NUMEX>, and were
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">iterated</ENAMEX> until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">convergence</TIMEX>. Previously known conserved
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein domains</ENAMEX> were detected using the corresponding
        PSI-BLAST-derived <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSSMs</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX>]. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSSMs</ENAMEX> were prepared by
        choosing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or more starting queries (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">seeds</ENAMEX>) for a set of
        most frequently encountered domains (see [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX>] for details)
        and run against the NR database until convergence with the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">-C</ENAMEX> option of PSI-BLAST to save the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSSM</ENAMEX>. It was ensured
        that at convergence no false positives were included in the
        profiles. This profile database can be downloaded from [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">51</NUMEX>] or used on the Internet via the RPS-BLAST program [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">52</NUMEX>]. All globular segments of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that did not map to
        domains with previously constructed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSSMs</ENAMEX> were searched
        individually using PSI-BLAST to detect any additional
        domains that may have been overlooked. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hidden Markov</ENAMEX>
        model-based searches were run using the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">HMMER2</NUMEX> package [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX>].
        Multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alignments</ENAMEX> were constructed using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX>_Coffee
        program [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53</TIMEX>], followed by manual correction based on the
        PSI-BLAST results. Protein secondary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> was
        predicted using a multiple alignment as the input for the
        JPRED program [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX>].
