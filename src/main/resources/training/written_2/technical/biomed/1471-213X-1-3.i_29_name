        Abnormal anterior segment development is often
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), an
        important risk factor for the blinding disease glaucoma [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>]. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">anterior segment</ENAMEX> of the eye is filled with a clear
        fluid known as the aqueous humor or aqueous. Maintenance of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> is dependent on a balance between <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aqueous</ENAMEX> formation and
        aqueous outflow. The primary source of aqueous is blood
        flowing through the arteries of the ciliary body [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>]. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aqueous</ENAMEX> is secreted by the ciliary body into the posterior
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chamber</ENAMEX> between the iris and lens. It then flows into the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">anterior</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX>, the space between the cornea and iris,
        before draining from the eye at the iridocorneal junction [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>]. The iridocorneal junction is located in a region known
        as the iridocorneal angle because of the aqueous filled
        angular recess between the iris root and cornea. One
        drainage route consists of a trabecular meshwork (TM) of
        connective tissue covered by endothelial like trabecular
        cells and a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schlemm</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canal</ENAMEX> (SC). The aqueous percolates
        through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> or intertrabecular spaces in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TM</ENAMEX> before
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">entering SC</ENAMEX>. The fluid collected by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SC</ENAMEX> drains into aqueous
        veins that connect to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canal</ENAMEX>. This route is generally
        accepted to be the major drainage pathway for the aqueous [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>]. Egress via the loose connective tissue meshwork and
        blood vessels of the uvea (choroid, iris and ciliary body)
        and the outer wall of the eye (sclera) also contributes to
        aqueous drainage [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3, 4</ENAMEX>]. Primary access of aqueous to the
        uveoscleral route is likely deep in the angle recess at the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">iridocorneal</ENAMEX> junction. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> to aqueous flow
        presented by the tissues of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TM</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SC</ENAMEX>, and likely uvea and
        sclera are important determinants of the rate of aqueous
        outflow and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX>.
        The molecular mechanisms responsible for normal or
        abnormal development of the iridocorneal angle, its
        structures, and increased resistance to aqueous drainage in
        glaucoma are not well defined. Cell migration,
        proliferation, and differentiation are important for the
        development of this ocular region. Cells of the periocular
        mesenchyme migrate into the developing eye and
        differentiate into various anterior segment structures
        including components of the ciliary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TM</ENAMEX>, iris
        stroma, corneal endothelium and corneal stroma. The origin
        of the periocular mesenchyme was originally suggested to be
        the paraxial mesoderm [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>]. Later fate mapping studies
        using quail-chick chimeras show extensive cranial neural
        crest contribution to this tissue [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6, 7</ENAMEX>]. Based on these
        avian studies, the mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">periocular</ENAMEX> mesenchyme is
        generally accepted as neural crest derived [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8, 9</ENAMEX>]. Recent
        cell grafting and cell labeling studies of craniofacial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">morphogenesis</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse embryos</ENAMEX> confirm a neural crest
        derivation of the mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">periocular</ENAMEX> mesenchyme [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>].
        Additionally, however, they demonstrate the presence of
        cranial paraxial mesoderm-derived cells in this tissue.
        Thus, aberrations of both neural crest and mesoderm cell
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">migration</ENAMEX> or differentiation may contribute to anterior
        segment dysgenesis and glaucoma.
        After the migrating mesenchymal cells reach the anterior
        margin of the developing optic cup they must form the
        tissues of the iridocorneal angle. The iridocorneal angle
        is initially occupied by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">densely</ENAMEX> packed mass of
        mesenchymal cells. As <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TM</ENAMEX> development proceeds the cellular
        mass differentiates, organizes and develops <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> to
        produce the mature <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">meshwork</TIMEX>. The developing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TM</ENAMEX> and iris
        separate forming the deep angle recess through which the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">aqueous</ENAMEX> passes to access the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TM</ENAMEX>. The mature meshwork
        consists of trabecular beams separated by intertrabecular
        spaces through which the aqueous percolates. The trabecular
        beams are covered on both surfaces by endothelial-like
        trabecular cells and the cores of the beams are composed of
        extracellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">matrix components</ENAMEX> such as collagen and
        elastic tissue [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>].
        How the complex <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TM</ENAMEX> develops and how spaces form in the
        initially continuous cellular tissue is not clear. Several
        theories have attempted to explain the differentiation and
        morphogenesis of the mesenchyme that forms the tissues of
        the iridocorneal angle (see [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17</TIMEX>]).
        Some of these theories propose atrophy or resorption of the
        mesenchyme as development progresses to create the
        structures and spaces important for aqueous drainage while
        others propose a reorganization of cells with no cell death
        or atrophy. Whether cell death or atrophy occurs during TM
        and iridocorneal angle development remains controversial.
        Cell death was prominent in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX>, but not in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkey</ENAMEX>, human
        or dog eyes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17, 18, 19, 20, 21</TIMEX>]. It is not clear if
        different mechanisms are important in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rodents</ENAMEX> as compared
        to these other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, if there is something unusual about
        the studied rat strain, or if cell death occurs in the
        other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> but was not detected due to inadequate tissue
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sampling</ENAMEX> or the stages analyzed.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> represents an important experimental model for
        understanding mammalian development and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> caused by
        its abnormalities. In studied mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">iridocorneal</ENAMEX> angle development is incomplete at birth.
        Although various studies have characterized in detail the
        prenatal development of the mouse eye there is very little
        published about the normal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> or postnatal
        development of the mouse iridocorneal angle [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22, 23, 24</TIMEX>,
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25, 26, 27</TIMEX>]. The aims of this work were to determine the
        developmental profile of the mouse iridocorneal angle to
        its mature form and to assess the role of cell death in
        modeling the angle recess and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TM</ENAMEX>. We present a light and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electron</ENAMEX> microscopic (EM) evaluation of iridocorneal angle
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX> in staged embryos and through <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> postnatal
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX>, when the angle <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> have reached full
        maturity. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> and human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TM</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SC</ENAMEX> have similar
        structures, and the developmental progression is similar
        except for the accelerated time frame in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. Extensive
        use of light microscopy, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EM</ENAMEX> and a cell death assay (on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX> spanning complete eyes) failed to identify cell
        death at all tested ages in various mouse strains. These
        results substantiate models of iridocorneal angle
        mesenchymal differentiation and modeling that involve
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organization</ENAMEX> of cellular and extracellular matrix
        components without cell death or atrophy, and they suggest
        a conservation of developmental mechanisms between <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> and
        non-rodent mammals.
      
      
        Results
        
          Prenatal development
          This study of the prenatal development of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C57BL/6J</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">iridocorneal</ENAMEX> angle, essentially agrees with published
          reports of general ocular development for the strains
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CFI-S</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>] and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ha/1CR</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>]. Due to these previous
          reports, we will focus on the formation of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">iridocorneal</ENAMEX> angle <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> (see figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2Afor</NUMEX> location)
          with brief mention of the adjacent iris and cornea.
          Invagination of the optic vesicle to form the optic cup
          occurs around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E10</TIMEX>, as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">lens</ENAMEX> vesicle is developing [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX>]. Shortly after the stalk of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">lens</ENAMEX> vesicle
          disappears at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">E10.5</NUMEX>, a few undifferentiated mesenchymal
          cells were present adjacent to the anterior margin of the
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">optic cup</NUMEX>. These were more prominent by E11.5 and were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with blood vessels (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2B</NUMEX>) that become the
          source of the anterior vascular tunic of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">lens</ENAMEX> as well
          as contributing to the future vascular supply of the iris
          and ciliary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>. At this time, progenitor cells of the
          corneal stroma had migrated into the developing cornea
          (not shown). By <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">E14.5</NUMEX>, the anterior margin of the optic
          cup that ultimately forms the iris and ciliary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> has
          started to advance indicating that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">anterior uvea</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">iridocorneal</ENAMEX> angle were starting to form. The mesenchyme
          in the developing iridocorneal angle (angle mesenchyme)
          had produced a loosely arranged cluster of cells that was
          several cells thick and extended from the anterior edge
          of the optic cup to the anterior termination of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">retina</ENAMEX>. These cells were characterized by plump oval
          nuclei with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple nucleoli</ENAMEX>. There was no clear
          division between the mesenchyme of the posterior corneal
          surface and the angle mesenchyme because the cells
          remained undifferentiated (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2C</NUMEX>). By E16.5 the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">anterior</ENAMEX> margin of the optic cup had extended more
          anteriorly but no obvious differentiation into the iris
          and ciliary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> had occurred. The angle mesenchyme was
          more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">densely</ENAMEX> packed and continuous with the mesenchyme
          extending onto the primitive iris that will become the
          iris stroma (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2D</NUMEX>). There was a clear separation
          between the developing iris and cornea, the first
          appearance of the iridocorneal angle recess (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2D</NUMEX>).
          There were no obvious differences between E16.5 and E18.5
          except that the ciliary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> had started to form as
          previously reported [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>].
        
        
          Postnatal development
          At birth (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P0</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19.5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dpc</ENAMEX>), the angle mesenchyme was even
          more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">densely</ENAMEX> packed and the cells and their nuclei were
          more elongated and less rounded than at earlier stages
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2E</NUMEX>). The iris was more differentiated as
          evidenced by the fact that some of the cells destined to
          form the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stroma</ENAMEX> had started to synthesize <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pigment</ENAMEX> and
          were, therefore, distinguishable from those of the future
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TM</ENAMEX>. The iris and ciliary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> became separate as the
          ciliary processes continued to form (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2E</NUMEX>).
          The specialized basal lamina of the corneal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">endothelium</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Descemet</ENAMEX>'s membrane) was first evident at P2
          to P4. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P4</TIMEX>, the iris and ciliary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> were well
          developed. Pigmented cells and blood vessels were clearly
          evident in the iris stroma and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ciliary</ENAMEX> processes were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">elongated</ENAMEX> and more numerous (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2F</NUMEX>). The future
          location of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TM</ENAMEX> was clearly indicated by an
          aggregation of cells with densely stained, plump fusiform
          nuclei that separated the developing ciliary body from
          the cornea (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2F</NUMEX>).
          The angle mesenchyme extended from the termination of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Descemet</ENAMEX>'s membrane to the posterior termination of the
          ciliary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P8</TIMEX>. These cells were less densely packed
          than at earlier stages (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2G</NUMEX>). Although not
          definitively identified in our <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P8</ENAMEX> sections, at some
          locations there appeared to be small vascular channels
          present near the developing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TM</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ciliary</ENAMEX> processes and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">iris</ENAMEX> had an apparently mature structure by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P10</TIMEX>. By this
          age, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">anterior cells</ENAMEX> of the future <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TM</ENAMEX> had begun to
          separate, although the posterior cells remained closely
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">packed</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2H</NUMEX>). The first clear indications of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schlemm</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canal</ENAMEX> next to the developing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">TM</ENAMEX> were observed
          on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P10</TIMEX> as multiple small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">endothelial-</ENAMEX>lined channels
          located in the inner sclera over the posterior aspect of
          the ciliary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>, although this was best seen using
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transmission EM</ENAMEX> (see below). The presence or absence of
          these endothelial channels at this location varied with
          ocular region. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">anterior TM</ENAMEX> had started to separate
          focally from the iris at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P10</TIMEX>, and this was more extensive
          at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P12</TIMEX>. The angle mesenchyme had further developed into
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">beam</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P12</TIMEX> and, though small, more open
          spaces were apparent (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2I</NUMEX>). At <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P12</TIMEX> either
          endothelial-lined <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX> or a more mature <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SC</ENAMEX> were
          present in most <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX>.
          By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P14</TIMEX>, further spaces had opened in the angle,
          especially anteriorly, and for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time there was a
          consistent separation between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">anterior TM</ENAMEX> and iris
          root, forming the deep angle recess (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3A</NUMEX>). At this
          age, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SC</ENAMEX> that extended from the posterior end of the
          ciliary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> to a point slightly posterior to the end of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Descemet</ENAMEX>'s membrane was consistently observed in all
          ocular regions. Additionally, the separation of the iris
          away from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TM</ENAMEX> gave the appearance that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TM</ENAMEX> moved
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">anteriorly</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giant</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vacuoles</ENAMEX> (structures important for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aqueous</ENAMEX> movement from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TM</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canal lumen</ENAMEX>) were clearly
          observed indicating that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SC</ENAMEX> was functional at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P14</TIMEX> (Figure
          3A). By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three weeks of age</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SC</ENAMEX> had extended forward to
          the posterior termination of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Descemet</ENAMEX>'s membrane and
          large open spaces were present in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">anterior TM</ENAMEX>. Fewer
          spaces were evident in the posterior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TM</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3B</NUMEX>). Over
          the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next few weeks</TIMEX>, the spaces between the trabecular
          beams gradually became more open and extended further
          into the posterior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TM</ENAMEX>. Depending on the mouse and ocular
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">location</ENAMEX>, the iridocorneal angle and its structures
          typically reached their mature <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P35</TIMEX> to P42
          (compare Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3Cand 3D</ENAMEX>). In the mature <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intertrabecular</ENAMEX> spaces were always most prominent in the
          anterior aspect of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TM</ENAMEX>, and less so posteriorly
          (Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3Cand 3D</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          Other strains
          The postnatal developmental stages and time frame
          described above for B6 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> is essentially the same as
          that we observed for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A.</ENAMEX>BY/SnJ strain (not shown).
          There were no major differences in mature angle structure
          between <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> of different backgrounds, and the anterior
          to posterior TM differences described for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">B6</TIMEX> were evident
          in all strains (Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3E-3H</ENAMEX>). The biggest difference
          between the studied backgrounds was a consistently more
          robust ciliary muscle in the 129BS <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Electron</ENAMEX> microscopy
          To further understand iridocorneal angle development,
          we analyzed stages involving significant changes in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TM</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SC</ENAMEX> using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EM</ENAMEX>. Ultrastructural evaluation
          demonstrated that differentiation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TM</ENAMEX> was well
          underway by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P10</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trabecular</ENAMEX> beams were recognizable but
          not fully developed. The separation of individual
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">trabecular</ENAMEX> beams had begun and extracellular matrix
          deposition was evident. While present, trabecular beam
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">collagen</ENAMEX> was less abundant than in the mature eye, while
          elastic tissue was relatively more abundant (compare
          Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4Dand 4Eto Figure 5Fand 5G</ENAMEX>). The trabecular beams
          were more separated in the anterior than posterior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TM</ENAMEX>.
          The presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SC</ENAMEX> or its precursors varied with section
          level at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P10</TIMEX>. At <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some</NUMEX> locations there were no traces of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SC</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4A</NUMEX>) whereas at others it was relatively well
          formed with a thin endothelial lining (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4B</NUMEX>). No
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">giant</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vacuoles</ENAMEX> were observed at this age. At other levels
          of section, the early SC had a more primitive vascular
          appearance (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4C</NUMEX>), consistent with its likely
          derivation from coalescing venules.
          At <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P14</TIMEX>, spaces between the trabecular beams in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">anterior TM</ENAMEX> were typically more prominent than at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P10</TIMEX>.
          The posterior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TM</ENAMEX> remained relatively compressed compared
          to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">anterior TM</ENAMEX>, with smaller intertrabecular spaces
          (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5A</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5B</TIMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">extracellular matrix</ENAMEX> was more
          prominent than at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P10</TIMEX> (compare Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5Ato Figure 4A</ENAMEX>). A
          well developed, endothelial-lined <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SC</ENAMEX> was consistently
          present at all levels (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5B</NUMEX>), although giant
          vacuoles were relatively infrequent compared to older
          ages. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P18</TIMEX>, the intertrabecular spaces had enlarged to
          adult size even in some regions of the posterior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TM</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">giant</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vacuoles</ENAMEX> were abundant (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5C</NUMEX>). Smooth muscle
          cells (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5D</NUMEX>) located near the inner wall of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SC</ENAMEX> close
          to its posterior termination were first noted at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P14</TIMEX>. The
          major developmental changes had occurred by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P18</TIMEX>, with
          subsequent maturation primarily involving final
          enlargement of spaces in the posterior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TM</ENAMEX>.
          In adult <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SC</ENAMEX> was lined with attenuated
          endothelial cells and at low power several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">giant</ENAMEX> vacuoles
          were always present (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5E</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giant</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vacuoles</ENAMEX> were
          evenly distributed along the entire length of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schlemm</ENAMEX>'s
          <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">canal</ENAMEX>. There were <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3-4 trabecular</NUMEX> beams in the anterior
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">meshwork</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">7-10</ENAMEX> in the posterior meshwork. In the
          posterior adult meshwork, the extracellular matrix was
          more prominent and the intertrabecular spaces were
          smaller than anteriorly (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5F</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5G</TIMEX>).
        
        
          Absence of cell death in angle development
          Review of many sections examined by light microscopy
          did not identify dead or pyknotic cells at any age from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PO</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adult</ENAMEX>. Similar review of many <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EM</ENAMEX> failed
          to demonstrate any cells that had necrotic or apoptotic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">morphology</ENAMEX>. This was true for multiple mouse strains (see
          Methods). It is probable that all normal cell death
          during development utilizes pathways of programmed cell
          death (PCD) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>]. To further investigate if cell death
          occurred in the developing iridocorneal angle, we used a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fluorescent</ENAMEX> double labeling assay that identifies
          fragmented DNA using fluorescently labeled dUTP and
          detects chromatin condensation by binding of the dye
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">YOYO-1</ENAMEX>. Cells were identified as apoptotic only when they
          were doubly labeled (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). This assay is more
          sensitive than light <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">microscopy</ENAMEX> and allows more
          widespread testing than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EM</ENAMEX>. As shown above, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TM</ENAMEX> channel
          formation has started at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P10</TIMEX> and is mostly complete
          around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P18</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P20</TIMEX>, with subtle changes extending to P35
          to P42. Our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assay</ENAMEX> investigated tissues that spanned most
          of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this period</TIMEX> (see Methods), including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">time</TIMEX> points
          in the critical period surrounding <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P10</TIMEX> to P18 (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">P10, P12,</ENAMEX>
          P14 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P18</ENAMEX>). The majority of the angle was assessed by
          analyzing many <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX> that were obtained at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> μm
          intervals throughout the eye. During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">differentiation</TIMEX> from
          the trabecular anlage to a mature <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 2</NUMEX> doubly
          labeled cells were identified in the angles of
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">600</TIMEX> analyzed sections or approximately
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">120,000</NUMEX> analyzed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TM</ENAMEX> and SC cells. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of these positive
          cells was located in the lumen of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schlemm</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canal</ENAMEX> and was
          likely a blood cell. No apoptotic cells were detected in
          the ciliary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> and iris. In contrast, apoptotic retinal
          ganglion cells (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>) were frequently identified
          (often 2 or more apoptotic cells in a section) during the
          established period of developmental ganglion cell death
          (assessed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between P10 and P21</TIMEX>) and less abundantly
          afterwards. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Testis</ENAMEX> sections served as additional positive
          controls with each batch of processed slides, and
          abundant apoptotic cells were always detected.
          As a final assessment of a role for cell death
          pathways, we determined whether absence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAS</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FASL</ENAMEX> initiators of cell death alter iridocorneal angle
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX> and morphology. 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fas</ENAMEX> and 
          FasL are expressed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TM</ENAMEX> and a
          FAS-stimulating monoclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> causes <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">PCD</ENAMEX> of TM
          cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29, 30</TIMEX>]. We assessed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> of each of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant strains B6</ENAMEX>.MRL- 
          Fas 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">lpr and B6Smn</TIMEX>.C3H- 
          Fasl 
          gld , which respectively lack
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">functional FAS</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FASL</ENAMEX>. The eyes of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> lacking
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">functional FAS</ENAMEX> or FASL were similar in appearance to eyes
          from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">age-matched</ENAMEX> B6 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> (not shown). This indicates that
          these pro-apoptotic molecules are not required for normal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">iridocorneal</ENAMEX> angle development.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sequence</ENAMEX> and timing of iridocorneal angle
          morphogenesis
          In this study, we describe the morphogenesis of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse iridocorneal</ENAMEX> angle from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">prenatal stages</ENAMEX> to
          maturity. Our findings extend those of previous studies
          that did not focus on the iridocorneal angle or did not
          study its development to maturity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22, 23, 24, 25, 26</TIMEX>].
          The sequence and timing of morphogenic events in the
          C57BL<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/6J</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A.</ENAMEX>BY/SnJ <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> strains is summarized in
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, and is similar to that for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX>]. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX> also is similar in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>. The major difference
          is the age at which specific developmental stages occur,
          beginning prenatally but extending to around <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P42</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>
          and possibly to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> postnatal <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX>].
          Briefly, in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, migrating <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">mesenchyme</ENAMEX> begins to fill
          the space between the anterior edge of the optic cup, the
          surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ectoderm</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">lens</ENAMEX> vesicle at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">E11</NUMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">E12</TIMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Anlage</ENAMEX> formation appears complete by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P4</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P6</TIMEX>. Cell
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentiation</ENAMEX> within the anlage has started by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P8</TIMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trabecular</ENAMEX> beams are recognizable but not fully developed
          at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P10</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SC</ENAMEX> is first evident around <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P10</ENAMEX> and appears
          structurally mature around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P14</TIMEX>. Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SC</ENAMEX> is functional
          at this age, giant vacuoles are rare. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P18</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P21</TIMEX>, the
          major developmental changes have occurred, and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intertrabecular</ENAMEX> spaces have enlarged to adult size in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">anterior TM</ENAMEX> and some parts of the posterior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TM</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giant</ENAMEX>
          vacuoles become more abundant as spaces between the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">trabecular</ENAMEX> beams increase and are abundant at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">P18</NUMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P21</TIMEX>.
          After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P18-P21</TIMEX>, maturation primarily involves enlargement
          of spaces in the posterior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TM</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Participation of cell death in iridocorneal angle
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">morphogenesis</ENAMEX> is controversial
          Different theories on the mechanisms of morphogenesis
          of the angle mesenchyme to the complex tissues of the
          mature angle have been reviewed elsewhere [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12, 13, 14</TIMEX>,
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15, 16, 17</TIMEX>]. Important mechanisms that participate in
          complex tissue formation include: proliferation and
          differentiation of cells, differential growth rates of
          cells, modulation of the extracellular matrix, and cell
          death. Although there is evidence for a role of most of
          these processes in iridocorneal angle development and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">intertrabecular</ENAMEX> space opening (see [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>]), the role of
          cell death or atrophy is controversial.
          In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sprague Dawley</ENAMEX> (SD) <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX>, dying cells were readily
          identified from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P5</TIMEX> to P100 (average of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 to 20</NUMEX> dying
          cells per section) and less abundantly at older adult
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ages</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 to 3 per</NUMEX> section at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">P200</NUMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>]. This time frame
          encompasses the period of mesenchymal differentiation and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">channel</ENAMEX> formation in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> angle (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">P5</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">P60</NUMEX>). Due to
          this and the fact that dying cells were identified in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TM</ENAMEX>, iris, iris root and ciliary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>, it was proposed
          that cell death may serve to open the deep angle recess
          and to create spaces in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TM</ENAMEX> and uveoscleral outflow
          routes. The dying cells were frequently associated with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">macrophages</ENAMEX>. An established function of macrophages is
          the engulfment of cellular debris. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macrophages</ENAMEX> also can
          elicit cell death in normal development (see [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX>]). In
          the developing eye, macrophages are required to induce
          death of vascular endothelial cells during programmed
          capillary regression. Disruption of macrophage function
          prevents endothelial cell death and results in abnormal
          persistence of the capillary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> known as the
          pupillary membrane and hyaloid vasculature [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33, 34</TIMEX>].
          Together, these observations suggest that macrophage
          induced cell death may be important in angle
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">morphogenesis</ENAMEX>.
          By contrast to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> study, trabecular cell death
          was not observed or was rare in the developing human,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkey</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> TM [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12, 16, 17, 20, 21</TIMEX>], even though
          small numbers of macrophages were present in some of
          these studies. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> human study that considered total
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">cell</ENAMEX> numbers (as opposed to cell density), the total
          number of cells increased as the TM matured. Macrophages
          were reported in the developing <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">B6</NUMEX>) anterior
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chamber</ENAMEX> and a model of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TM</ENAMEX> development including cell
          death was proposed, but no cell death was recorded [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>].
          The reason for these differing results is still unclear,
          and may reflect factors such as the age of tissue sampled
          or the amount of tissue available for study.
        
        
          No evidence for cell death during mouse angle
          development
          We report here an extensive study of mouse eyes. Light
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microscopy</ENAMEX> failed to detect cell death in the developing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TM</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">B6</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A.</ENAMEX>BY/SnJ <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. Dying cells were not detected
          in the angle of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an additional 5</NUMEX> inbred strains
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> mixed genetic backgrounds at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ages up to P63</TIMEX>. No
          cells with the characteristic morphologic changes of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apoptosis</ENAMEX> or necrosis were observed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EM</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35, 36</TIMEX>] in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> of strain <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">B6</TIMEX>, or of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> other <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">inbred strains</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
          mixed genetic backgrounds at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ages up to P63</TIMEX>. Similarly,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 2</NUMEX> apoptotic cells were detected in the developing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SC</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TM</ENAMEX>, iris and ciliary body of B6 eyes using a cell
          death assay on sections collected throughout entire eyes.
          In contrast, apoptotic cells were frequently identified
          in the developing retinas on the same <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Importantly</ENAMEX>, the great majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> formation
          occurs during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">an 8 to 10 day</TIMEX> period surrounding <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P10</TIMEX> to
          P18. Our <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EM</ENAMEX> and fluorescent PCD assays included <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P10</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P14 and P18</TIMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P10</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P12</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P14 and P18</TIMEX>) time
          points respectively during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this critical</TIMEX> period. Although
          rare cases of cell death may be missed, the absence of
          cell death in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 600</NUMEX> analyzed sections
          provides no evidence for a role of cell death in angle
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">morphogenesis</ENAMEX>. Finally, development of the angle in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fas</ENAMEX> and 
          Fasl <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">null mice</ENAMEX> was normal
          indicating this system of cell death <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> that can
          kill TM cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>] is not required for TM channel
          formation. Based on these observations, we conclude that
          neither apoptosis nor necrosis are important mechanisms
          in development of the mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TM</ENAMEX> and iridocorneal angle.
          Our data, together with the rare occurrence of cell death
          in studies of various mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> including <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>,
          suggests that this is true for mammals in general.
        
        
          Possible explanations for conflicting results
          between various studies
          The absence of macrophages in the developing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TM</ENAMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> in the current study is in conflict to a previous
          study. That study reported macrophages on the corneal
          endothelium, on the iris surface and in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TM</ENAMEX> at P6
          through <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">P10</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>]. The abundance of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TM</ENAMEX> macrophages was
          not reported but the statement that they were observed in
          "favorable sections" suggests that they were not common.
          Macrophage mediated regression of the pupillary membrane
          occurs between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P4 and P10</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33, 37</TIMEX>]. In the
          current investigation, we observed macrophages in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">anterior</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX> between the iris and cornea, and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with the pupillary membrane between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P6</TIMEX> and
          P10. Thus, we suggest that the macrophages previously
          reported in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TM</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> (and possibly some other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>)
          were involved in the process of pupillary membrane
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">regression</ENAMEX> and were sometimes deposited in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TM</ENAMEX> but
          were not significant for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TM</ENAMEX> development. That TM cell
          death was not recorded in both studies supports this.
          The demonstration of cell death in a SD strain of rats
          has fueled the debate about mechanisms of iridocorneal
          angle development [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>]. This report disagrees with our
          findings in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> and warrants further discussion. In this
          rat strain, conspicuous numbers of macrophages were noted
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with dying cells in the iris, ciliary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TM</ENAMEX>. Given the similarities in developmental stages
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between both B6</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A.</ENAMEX>BY/SnJ <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> strains and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>,
          and the similar timing and progression of angle
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX>, it seems unlikely that
          mechanisms of angle morphogenesis would differ between
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX>. It is, therefore, difficult to reconcile
          the frequent cell death in the developing and adult
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">iridocorneal</ENAMEX> angle of an SD rat strain with the absence
          of cell death in multiple mouse strains in the current
          study. Although structural features and not morphogenesis
          were the focus of other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> studies, cell death was not
          reported in an EM analysis of the adult <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">TM</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Swiss</ENAMEX>
          albino <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX>, or of the adult angle of an unspecified
          strain of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">pigmented lab rats</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38, 39</TIMEX>]. These findings
          suggest that the SD rat strain may have atypical or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">excessive intraocular</ENAMEX> macrophage recruitment, formation,
          stimulation or persistence that may explain the
          macrophage abundance and cell death. Spontaneous axonal
          regeneration was recently reported in the transected
          optic nerve of adult SD rats [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX>]. This was unexpected
          because, in contrast to peripheral nerves, axons of the
          adult, mammalian central nervous system typically fail to
          regenerate following injury. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Regeneration</ENAMEX> is a complex
          and poorly understood process in which macrophages are
          known to be important. Addition of appropriately
          stimulated macrophages can induce a peripheral nerve-like
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">regenerative</ENAMEX> response in the damaged <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> optic nerve [
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41, 42, 43</TIMEX>]. Although the spontaneous axonal regeneration
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">SD rats</ENAMEX> is consistent with atypical macrophage
          activity, further experiments are needed to test
          this.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        Our results support a model of mesenchymal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentiation</ENAMEX> and iridocorneal angle development that
        involves reorganization of cellular and extracellular
        matrix components without cell death or atrophy. The use of
        genetically different mouse strains indicates that the
        absence of cell death is typical in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> and not unique to
        an individual strain. The lack of cell death, similar
        developmental profile, and similarities in mature angle
        structure in both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> suggests a conservation
        of general developmental mechanisms between <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> and
        non-rodent mammals. For general anterior segment
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>, this is supported by the observations that
        genetic deficiency of transcription factors such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PAX6</ENAMEX>,
        PITX2, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">FOXC1</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44, 45</TIMEX>], and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">LMX1B</ENAMEX> that are expressed in the
        periocular mesenchyme results in anterior segment
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dysgenesis</ENAMEX> in both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46, 47, 48, 49, 50</TIMEX>,
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">51, 52, 53, 54</TIMEX>]. In general, however, previous mouse
        studies have not examined the effects of mutations on the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TM</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SC</ENAMEX>. This is partly due to limited documentation of
        the sequence of events underlying iridocorneal angle
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX> and limited documentation of the mature angle
        structures in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. The current study provides important
        baseline information for mechanistic studies of angle
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX> in the existing mouse models of anterior
        segment dysgenesis. Additionally, it will facilitate
        experiments with <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mutant mice</ENAMEX> to determine how newly
        identified genes function in angle development and how the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathways</ENAMEX> in which they participate overlap or interact with
        each other. These experiments will enhance understanding of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">developmental</ENAMEX> processes involved in anterior segment
        formation, and glaucomas associated with anterior segment
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dysgenesis</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Materials and Methods
        
          Light microscopy
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">At least three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> C57BL<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/6J</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">B6</NUMEX>) were evaluated for
          each postnatal time period: newborn, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P2</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4, 6, 8, 10, 12</TIMEX>,
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P56</TIMEX>. Adult B6 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> ranging

          E18<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.5</NUMEX> were also examined. Additionally, progressive
          developmental <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stages</ENAMEX> in the strain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A.BY/SnJ</ENAMEX> were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">evaluated</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P1</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7, 14, 21, 28</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35 42</NUMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P60</ENAMEX>, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 to 6</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> at each age). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">A.BY/SnJ</ENAMEX> were normal <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> derived from

          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9 weeks old</TIMEX>) were used for each of the following strains
          or mixed backgrounds: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DBA</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/2J</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BALB/cByJ</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">129P3/J</ENAMEX> (former

          (129SvEvTac <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">X Black Swiss ></ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F2</ENAMEX>). <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Four week</TIMEX> old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DBA</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/2J</ENAMEX>
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SB/Le</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> also were studied. To determine if absence
          of the cell death <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediators FAS</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FASL</ENAMEX> alter
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">iridocorneal</ENAMEX> angle development and morphology, we
          assessed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">approximately P70</NUMEX>) of each of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant strains B6</ENAMEX>.MRL-

          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">lpr and B6Smn</TIMEX>.C3H-

          gld , which respectively lack
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">functional FAS</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FASL</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">55, 56, 57, 58</TIMEX>].
          For stages E11<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.5</NUMEX> through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P6</TIMEX>, whole <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heads</ENAMEX> were fixed in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bouin</ENAMEX>'s solution, paraffin embedded and sectioned at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> μm
          thickness. Eyes from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ages P8 and older</TIMEX> were fixed
          with a glutaraldehyde-paraformaldehyde solution [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53</TIMEX>],
          plastic embedded, sectioned at <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1.5 μm</NUMEX> thickness and
          stained with hematoxylin and eosin. For both paraffin and
          plastic-embedded B6 eyes, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 to 40</NUMEX> sections were
          collected from each of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> different ocular locations,
          using the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">lens</ENAMEX> as a landmark, resulting in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">75 to 120</TIMEX>
          sections per eye. Collected regions included the lens
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">periphery</ENAMEX>, central lens, and a region halfway between the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">center</ENAMEX> of the lens and the lens periphery. Iridocorneal
          angle development is somewhat variable both temporally
          and spatially within a single eye and between eyes. This
          necessitated careful scanning of all sections. The eyes
          of other <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX> were processed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">identically</ENAMEX>, except that
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30 to 40</NUMEX> sections through the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pupil</ENAMEX> and optic nerve were
          typically collected and analyzed. This also was true for
          some of the adult eyes from B6 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> that were <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P60</TIMEX> or
          older. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Developmental</ENAMEX> changes had to be consistently
          present in multiple sections from the same <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> to be
          regarded as real, and conclusions were drawn only from
          high quality sections. This approach guarded against the
          potential for distortion artifacts in the delicate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tissues</ENAMEX> analyzed.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Electron</ENAMEX> microscopy
          To assess developmental stages and to check for cell
          death, we studied eyes from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three or more</NUMEX> B6 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P10</TIMEX>,
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14, 18, 21, 35</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P60</TIMEX>; from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DBA/2J</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2 SB/LE</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>
          at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks of age</TIMEX>; and from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least two 7 to 9 week</TIMEX> old
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DBA</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/2J</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BALB/cJ</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">129P3/J</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">129SvEvTac</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">129B6F1</ENAMEX> and 129BS
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. Eyes were processed as previously described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53</TIMEX>].
          Tissue blocks from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 to 8</NUMEX> different locations around the
          eye were sectioned and analyzed for each eye.
        
        
          Fluorescent programmed cell death (PCD)
          assays
          B6 eyes at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P10</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12, 14, 18, 21, 29 and P36</TIMEX>, were
          immediately fixed in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4%</NUMEX> paraformaldehyde in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphate</ENAMEX> buffer pH <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">7.2</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3 hours</TIMEX>, transferred to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.4%</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">paraformaldehyde</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M phosphate</ENAMEX> buffer for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</NUMEX> hrs,
          and infiltrated with paraffin. Eyes from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> in each age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> were sectioned at <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 μm</NUMEX> thickness
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX> were collected at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> μm intervals through
          the entire eye, except for very peripheral locations that
          did not contain iridocorneal angle. Depending on the size
          of the eye between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30 and 81</NUMEX> sections were collected per
          eye. We analyzed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 600</NUMEX> sections and estimate
          that considering all ages there was on average <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> cells
          in each angle region of our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX>. Thus, we analyzed
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 120,000</NUMEX> developing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TM</ENAMEX> and SC cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">100</ENAMEX>
          cells <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X 600 sections X 2</ENAMEX> angle <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> per section). A
          modified double labeling protocol that involved 
          in situ end-labeling of fragmented
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DNA (</ENAMEX>using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BODIPY</ENAMEX> fluorophores, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Molecular Probes</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eugene</ENAMEX>,
          Or.) and detection of condensed chromatin (with the
          dimeric cyanine dye <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">YOYO-1</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Molecular Probes</ENAMEX>) was used to
          analyze all of these sections [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">59</TIMEX>]. Samples were
          analyzed with a confocal microscope and cells were
          identified as apoptotic only when they were double
          labeled. The occurrence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCD</ENAMEX> was evaluated in the iris,
          ciliary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TM</ENAMEX>.
