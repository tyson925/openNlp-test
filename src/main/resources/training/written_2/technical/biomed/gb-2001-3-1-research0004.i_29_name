          Nomenclature
          In recent publications involving bioinformatic
          analysis of aromatic amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid biosynthesis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9, 10, 11</TIMEX>,
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12, 13, 14</TIMEX>], we have implemented a nomenclature that
          attempts logical and consistent naming of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and their
          gene products for different <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>. The problem is
          exemplified by the contemporary naming in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> model
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3-deoxy-D-</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">arabino -heptulosonate 7-phosphate</ENAMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAHP</ENAMEX>) synthase, the initial enzyme step of aromatic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">amino-acid biosynthesis</ENAMEX>. In 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bacillus subtilis</ENAMEX> the gene,
          appropriately enough, has been named 
          aroA, but in 
          Escherichia <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coli</ENAMEX> the equivalent
          function is represented by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> encoding three
          differentially regulated paralogs. These 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli genes</ENAMEX> have been named 
          aroF, aroG and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aroH</ENAMEX>. In 
          B. subtilis these latter <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> gene
          designations refer to <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">synthase</ENAMEX> (step <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> of chorismate synthesis), chorismate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">synthase</ENAMEX> (step <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>) and chorismate mutase (initial step of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenylalanine</ENAMEX> and tyrosine biosynthesis). Even in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">subtilis</ENAMEX>, where the naming was
          intended to follow an orderly progression in terms of
          order of reaction steps, there is the complication that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAHP</ENAMEX> synthase is expressed as a fusion of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> catalytic
          domains, one being a class of chorismate mutase called
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AroQ</ENAMEX>. This requires naming at the level of domain and the
          designation 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aroQ• aroA</ENAMEX> was implemented to
          denote such a fusion [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9, 10, 11, 12</TIMEX>]. Thus, a single
          enzymatic function in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> is accommodated
          through the cumulative expression of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">paralog genes</ENAMEX>,
          but in another <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> is only encoded by a portion of a
          single gene. A universal nomenclature is needed that
          labels at the level of domain, that labels in synchrony
          with order of reaction steps as much as possible, and
          that labels isofunctional paralogs at the same
          hierarchical level but with discriminating
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">identifiers</ENAMEX>.
          The status of nomenclature for the tryptophan pathway
          is not so chaotic as the genes in almost all prokaryotes
          have been named in line with 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX>, but even here distinct
          problems have arisen because gene fusions that exist in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> are often absent elsewhere.
          Much of the literature <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">up to at least 1996</TIMEX> used <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> gene
          designations for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein domains</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>]. In 
          B. subtilis these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> protein
          domains are encoded by separate genes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>]. Thus, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli trpD</ENAMEX> encodes the equivalent
          of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. subtilis TrpG</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TrpD</ENAMEX>. The 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli gene</ENAMEX> fusion has been
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">re</ENAMEX>-designated with the convention of a bullet to
          represent a fusion: 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">trpG• trpD</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>]. Likewise, the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli trpC</ENAMEX> encodes the equivalent
          of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. subtilis TrpC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">TrpF</ENAMEX>, and the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli gene</ENAMEX> fusion has been
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">re</ENAMEX>-designated 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">trpC•</ENAMEX> trpF. The nomenclature we
          advocate is more easily remembered because genes are
          named in the order of pathway reaction. Subunits for a
          given reaction are named at the same hierarchical level:
          anthranilate synthase (first reaction) consists of TrpAa
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">TrpAb</ENAMEX>, and tryptophan synthase (<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX> reaction)
          consists of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TrpEa</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TrpEb</ENAMEX>. The implementation of a
          logical and consistent nomenclature, as illustrated in
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, should be most helpful in the long term.
        
      
      
        Results and discussion
        
          Phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> construction
          Initial amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid alignments</ENAMEX> were generated using
          ClustalW software, version 1.4 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>]. Manual adjustments
          were made through visual inspection to bring conserved
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">motifs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> into register. This was implemented
          by use of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BioEdit</ENAMEX> multiple alignment tool [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>].
          Inferences about the evolutionary relationships within
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TrpEa</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TrpEb</ENAMEX> protein <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> were made using the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">PHYLIP</ENAMEX> package of programs [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>]. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Protpars</ENAMEX> program
          was used to generate a maximum parsimony <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>, and the
          neighbor-joining and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fitch</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">programs</ENAMEX> were used to generate
          a distance-based <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>. The distance matrix used in the
          latter programs was produced using the program Protdist
          with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Dayoff PAM matrix</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seqboot</ENAMEX> and Consense
          programs were then used to assess the statistical
          strength of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> using bootstrap resampling.
          Neighbor-joining (PHYLIP), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fitch</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Margolash</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fitch</ENAMEX> in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PHYLIP</ENAMEX>), and maximum parsimony methods [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>] all produced
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> consistent with one another. Despite low bootstrap
          values at many individual internal nodes, the clusters
          formed and arrangement of taxa within them were largely
          identical. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ninety TrpEb</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">63</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">TrpEa</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> were
          analyzed.
        
        
          Distinctly different types of TrpEb
          TrpEb <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> divide into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> distinctly different
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">groups</ENAMEX>, as illustrated by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the unrooted</TIMEX> tree shown in
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. The major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, denoted <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">TrpEb</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>, includes the
          well-studied enzymes from such <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> as 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Salmonella</ENAMEX>
          typhimurium, and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">subtilis</ENAMEX>. The minor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">denoted TrpEb</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>, is represented heavily, but not
          exclusively, by archaeal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. Among the current
          inventory of completed archaeal genomes, only 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Methanococcus</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">jannaschii</ENAMEX> lacks
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">TrpEb</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Seven</NUMEX> archaeal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genomes</ENAMEX> possess both <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">TrpEb</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">TrpEb</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Methanosarcina barkeri</ENAMEX> possesses
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> paralogs of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">TrpEb</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX> in addition to one species of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">TrpEb</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Six</NUMEX> archaeal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genomes</ENAMEX> possess <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">TrpEb</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>, but not
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">TrpEb</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bacterial TrpEb</ENAMEX>_<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are thus far limited to 
          Aquifex, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thermotoga, Mycobacterium</ENAMEX>,
          Geobacter, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chlorobium</ENAMEX> and 
          Rhodopseudomonas genera. In
          addition, one of the multiple TrpEb <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> present in
          the higher <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>, 
          Arabidopsis thaliana, belongs to
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">TrpEb</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 subfamily.</ENAMEX> In view of the distinct divergence
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">TrpEb</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">TrpEb</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>, one might expect that either
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">TrpEb</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX> has lost the ability to interact allosterically
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TrpEa</ENAMEX>, or perhaps that a divergent subgroup of TrpEa
          has coevolved with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">TrpEb</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>. Multiple copies of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TrpEb</ENAMEX> are
          often present in genomes. Examples include cases where
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">TrpEb</ENAMEX>_<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species coexist</ENAMEX>, where <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">TrpEb</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 species</ENAMEX>
          coexist, or where <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">TrpEb</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">TrpEb</ENAMEX>_<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> coexist in the same
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX>. A number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. barkeri</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rhodobacter</ENAMEX> capsulatus,
          Chlamydia psittaci, and 
          Corynebacterium diphtheriae )
          possess <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> copies of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">TrpEb</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>. In each case the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">trpEb</ENAMEX>_<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> copy that is linked to 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trpEa</ENAMEX> is highly conserved, whereas
          the remaining copy has diverged to the extent that it may
          be a pseudogene (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">TrpEb</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1</ENAMEX> products of these
          probable pseudogenes have elongated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branches</ENAMEX> (highlighted
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">yellow</ENAMEX>) on the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> tree shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>.
          It is noteworthy that cyanobacterial and higher plant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">amino-acid</ENAMEX> sequences form a cohesive cluster for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">TrpEb</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1,</ENAMEX>
          as shown in phylogram form in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>(left <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>). An
          analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TrpEa proteins</ENAMEX> from the same organisms yields
          a very similar phylogram output (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, right <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>).
          This higher <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>/cyanobacteria relationship is
          pleasingly consistent with the endosymbiotic hypothesis
          of organelle evolution. In each case 
          Prochlorococcus marinus and 
          Synechococcus <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> are the
          outlying sequence <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, with the other cyanobacterial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> ( 
          Nostoc punctiforme and 
          Anabaena <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>) being closer to
          the higher <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> sequences from 
          A. thaliana and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">corn</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zea mays</ENAMEX> ). The order of branching
          shown is supported by very high bootstrap values. Zma-3
          is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TrpEa</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> that has been proposed [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>] to
          function independently of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TrpEb</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX>, producing
          indole for entry into a pathway other than tryptophan. In
          this case indole serves as a precursor for a defense
          metabolite that is active against <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fungi</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TrpEa</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms lacking TrpEb</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> (all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Archaea</ENAMEX>) possess intact tryptophan
          pathways, but they lack <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">TrpEb</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TrpEb</ENAMEX> in 
          Thermoplasma volcanii, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T.</ENAMEX>
          acidophilum, and 
          Ferroplasma acidarmanus is
          represented only by a single species of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">TrpEb</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>. Although
          
          Sulfolobus solfataricus, Aeropyrum
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pernix</ENAMEX> and 
          Pyrobaculum aerophilum all possess
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TrpEb</ENAMEX>, both are the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">TrpEb</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX> variety. Thus,
          in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all six</NUMEX> of these lineages <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TrpEa</ENAMEX> either might be unable
          to form a tight complex with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">TrpEb</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>, or might have
          evolved different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-protein</ENAMEX> contacts. In the latter
          case, distinct <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">TrpEa</ENAMEX> subgroupings might be expected in
          parallel with the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">TrpEb</ENAMEX> subgroupings. On the
          contrary, all TrpEa sequences fall into a single group
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). However, in contrast to sequences present in
          those <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Archaea</ENAMEX> that do possess <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">TrpEb</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX> (for example, 
          Archaeoglobus, species of 
          Pyrococcus, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Methanococcus</ENAMEX>,
          Methanobacterium, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Methanosarcina</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Halobacterium</ENAMEX> ), the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> archaeal
          lineages that possess only <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">TrpEb</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX> have very distinctive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">elongated</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branches</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">TrpEa tree</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). This
          suggests an elevated rate of evolutionary divergence, due
          either to selection for new productive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contacts</ENAMEX> of TrpEa
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">TrpEb</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX> or to lack of constraint to maintain TrpEa
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> previously important for contacts with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">TrpEb</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>.
          The long <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TrpEa</ENAMEX> sequence of 
          Chlamydia trachomatis reflects its
          likely status as a pseudogene. This is consistent with
          the observation that 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C. trachomatis TrpEb</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>)
          also seems to be a pseudogene. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> does not expect
          positive selection for maintenance of function in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> trachomatis as it lacks an
          intact tryptophan pathway. Indeed, the alteration in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> trachomatis of many otherwise
          invariant amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid residues</ENAMEX> is evident from the
          information given in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>.

          Figure 5shows an alignment of the amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid</ENAMEX> sequence

          The tryptophan synthase of

          documented example of substrate channeling in which

          internalized <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">tunnel</ENAMEX> ([ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>] and references therein). Ligand
          binding at the α-site and covalent transformations at the

          either lacking or involves different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">contacts</ENAMEX>, one might
          expect the important catalytic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>, but not the
          allosteric <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>, to be conserved in comparison of

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aquifex</ENAMEX> and 
          Chlorobium all 
          trp genes are dispersed, and

          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">trpEb</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX> or 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">trpEb</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bacteria</ENAMEX> and Archaea
          the gene order 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">trpEb</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX> → trpEa is one of the most
          highly conserved of genomic gene arrangements. Often
          translational coupling exists, as seen in Figure 7for 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">P. furiosus, P. abyssi</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M.</ENAMEX>
          thermoautotrophicum, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T.</ENAMEX> volcanium, Archaeoglobus
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fulgidus</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T.</ENAMEX> maritima. In each of the latter
          genomes 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">trpEb</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2</ENAMEX> is outside the 
          trp operon. Both species of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Thermoplasma</ENAMEX> possess an otherwise
          intact 
          trp operon that lacks 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">trpEb</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX> (also not present elsewhere
          in the genome). Hence, by default it appears that the
          unlinked 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">trpEb</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX> must function for
          tryptophan biosynthesis in these <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>. In 
          A. pernix and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> solfataricus all of the 
          trp genes are adjacent, but 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">trpEb</ENAMEX>_<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> flanks 
          trpEa, and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">trpEb</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1</ENAMEX> is absent from these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genomes</ENAMEX>. In each case, a second unlinked copy of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">trpEb</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2</ENAMEX> is present. In 
          Geobacter sulfurreducens, both 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trpEa</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">trpEb</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX> (presumably partnered based
          on the results shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) are unlinked to one
          another, and both are outside an otherwise intact 
          trp operon. In this case it seems
          curious indeed that the operon contains 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">trpEb</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>. 
          A snapshot of the incredibly dynamic alteration of
          tryptophan gene <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> in prokaryotes is apparent
          from Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>. Of the organisms shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>, the
          most consistent linkage is that of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trpAa</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trpAb</ENAMEX>. In 
          A. fulgidus trpD and 
          trpB are fused, whereas in 
          Rhodopseudomonas palustris
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trpAa</ENAMEX> and 
          trpAb are fused. Operons are
          sometimes incomplete as with 
          P. aerophilum and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">G. sulfurreducens</ENAMEX>, or fragmented,
          as with 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R.</ENAMEX> palustris. In 
          A. pernix an inverted arrangement
          yields a divergent transcription of 
          trpEa → trpEb_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX> → trpC → trpD and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">trpB → trpAa → trpAb</ENAMEX>. This is also
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the very few cases where the order is 
          trpEa → trpEb instead of the usual 
          trpEb → trpEa. 
          The 
          Ferroplasma genome illustrates a
          case where a non-tryptophan pathway gene, 
          aroA encoding DAHP synthase, is a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the operon (translationally coupled). The
          implied transcriptional control of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAHP</ENAMEX> synthase by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>-tryptophan potentially could produce growth inhibition
          by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>-tryptophan because of limitation of precursors
          needed for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>-phenylalanine and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>-tyrosine biosynthesis.
          This is because no other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> encoding DAHP synthase
          appear to be present in the genome. It would be
          interesting to know whether the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ferroplasma DAHP</ENAMEX> synthase is
          sensitive to allosteric control or not. The phenomenon of
          growth inhibition triggered by exogenous amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> is
          exemplified by the effect of exogenous L-phenylalanine
          upon <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAHP</ENAMEX> synthase in 
          Neisseria gonorrhoeae [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>] and in
          other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> ([ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>] and references therein).
          What is the function of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">TrpEb</ENAMEX>_<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>? As previously
          discussed, it seems clear that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">TrpEb</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX> has sometimes been
          pressed into service with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TrpEa</ENAMEX> to function as tryptophan
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">synthase</ENAMEX>. What might be its function in those situations
          where 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">trpEb</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2</ENAMEX> is isolated away from a
          typical tryptophan operon, which possesses closely linked
          or translationally coupled genes specifying 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trpEa</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">trpEb</ENAMEX>_<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>? 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">TrpEb</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX> from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. typhimurium</ENAMEX> is the prototype
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of a superfamily of pyridoxal phosphate
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLP</ENAMEX>)-dependent enzymes that are of remote relationship
          and that catalyze β-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">replacement</ENAMEX> and β-elimination
          reactions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28, 29, 30</TIMEX>]. These include 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> -acetylserine sulfhydrylase,
          threonine deaminase, threonine synthase, cystathionine
          β-synthase, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate</NUMEX> deaminase,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>-serine dehydratase, and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-serine dehydratase. Isolated

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dehydratase</ENAMEX> (deaminase) 
          in vitro, but does not support
          significant levels of the other activities. It does not
          seem likely that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">TrpEb</ENAMEX>_<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> catalyzes the latter reactions
          either, as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Psi-Blast of TrpEb</ENAMEX>_<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> did not return
          hits for them any more avidly than was the case for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">TrpEb</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX> queries.
          Perhaps the most likely 'alternative' function of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">TrpEb</ENAMEX>_<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> is a catalytic activity already
          established as an

          function alone for tryptophan biosynthesis in cells that
          acquire indole from the environment. Little information
          about the availability and utilization of indole in
          nature seems to exist. Model organisms such as 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">subtilis</ENAMEX> transport indole poorly
          and it tends to be toxic, but these <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> lack
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">TrpEb</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>.
          As stated above, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> established 
          in vitro activity of isolated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">TrpEb</ENAMEX>_<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> dimers is L-serine dehydratase (deaminase):
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">L-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">serine → pyruvate</ENAMEX> + ammonia. It is indeed suggestive
          that the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">TrpEb</ENAMEX>_<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> correlates almost perfectly
          with the absence of the primary L-serine deaminase
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">COG1760</NUMEX>) used in nature (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). This <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">SdaA</ENAMEX> class of
          serine deaminase is an iron-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur protein</ENAMEX>, not a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pyridoxal 5</ENAMEX>'-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">phosphate protein</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX>]. It is absent from
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Archaea</ENAMEX>. Although widely distributed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bacteria</ENAMEX>,
          it is not present in 
          Thermotoga, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aquifex, Chlorobium</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Geobacter</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rhodopseudomonas</ENAMEX>. Mycobacterium
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">smegmatis</ENAMEX> is the only <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">TrpEb</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>-containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> to
          possess an <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">SdaA</ENAMEX> homolog.
          There are other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> for carrying out the serine
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">deaminase</ENAMEX> reaction. A serine deaminase that is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLP</ENAMEX>-dependent exists in eukaryotes, but seems to be
          absent or rare in prokaryotes. Threonine dehydratase has
          a lesser capability to carry out the serine dehydratase
          reaction 
          in vitro. 'Biosynthetic' (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IlvA</ENAMEX>) and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'catabolic'</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TdcA</ENAMEX>) threonine deaminase are homologs,
          except that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IlvA</ENAMEX> has a unique carboxy-terminal extension
          that provides an allosteric module. Most archaea lack 
          ilvA, and only a limited number
          possess catabolic threonine dehydratase.
          If archaea lack 
          ilvA, what is the source of
          α-ketobutyrate for isoleucine biosynthesis? It appears
          likely that α-ketobutyrate is generated instead by the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'pyruvate</ENAMEX>' pathway in which citramalate is generated as
          the initial intermediate. A few tracer studies in the
          older literature have indicated derivation of
          α-ketobutyrate from pyruvate rather than from threonine [
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32, 33</TIMEX>], and (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>)-citramalate synthase activity has been
          shown recently in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. jannaschii</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">MJ1392</NUMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX>]. This
          pathway was initially shown to exist in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leptospira</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX>], and it seems
          likely that more examples will surface. Indeed, it is
          interesting that an enteric <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacterium</ENAMEX> has a latent
          potential to replace the threonine deaminase step with a
          pyruvate-derived pathway under appropriate selective
          conditions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX>]. The citramalate pathway for conversion
          of pyruvate to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-ketobutyrate involves a carbon-chain
          elongation mechanism that uses an initial step of
          condensation with acetyl-CoA, followed by rearrangement,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oxidation</ENAMEX> and elimination of a carbon to produce a keto
          acid differing from the original substrate by the
          presence of an additional <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon</ENAMEX>. This mechanism is
          familiar in nature, analogous steps being used in the TCA
          cycle, the ketoadipate pathway of lysine biosynthesis,
          and in leucine biosynthesis. These analogous steps in
          different pathways were originally used in formulating
          the recruitment hypothesis for evolutionary acquisition
          of new function [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX>], and it is interesting that the
          citramalate synthase gene shown in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. jannaschii</ENAMEX> had previously been
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">annotated</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as α-isopropylmalate synthase</NUMEX> (which catalyzes
          the initial step of leucine biosynthesis).
          Overall, the cumulative evidence indicates that
          established sources of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>-serine dehydratase are low or
          absent in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> that possess <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">TrpEb</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>, and therefore
          points to a plausible role for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">TrpEb</ENAMEX>_<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX>-serine
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dehydratase</ENAMEX>.
