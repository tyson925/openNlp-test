        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">determination</ENAMEX> of multiple, complete genome sequences
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>, archaea and eukaryotes has created the
        opportunity for a new level of phylogenetic analysis that
        is based not on a phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> for selected molecules,
        for example, rRNAs, as in traditional molecular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phylogenetic</ENAMEX> studies [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] , but (ideally) on the entire
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> of information contained in the genomes. The most
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">straightforward</ENAMEX> version of this type of analysis, to which
        we <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hereinafter</ENAMEX> refer to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">as 'genome-</NUMEX>tree' <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>, involves
        scaling-up the traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>-building approach and
        analyzing the phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> for multiple gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>
        (in principle, all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> represented in many genomes),
        in an attempt to derive a consensus, 'organismal' phylogeny
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4 5</NUMEX> ] . However, because of the wide spread of
        horizontal gene transfer and lineage-specific gene loss, at
        least in the prokaryotic world, comparison of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> for
        different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> and consensus derivation may become
        highly problematic [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7</NUMEX> ] . Probably due to all these
        problems, a pessimistic conclusion has been reached that
        prokaryotic phylogeny might not be reconstructable from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein sequences</ENAMEX>, at least with current phylogenetic
        methods [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] .
        With the complete genome sequences at hand, it appears
        natural to seek for alternatives to traditional,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">alignment</ENAMEX>-based tree-<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> in the form of integral
        characteristics of the evolutionary process. Probably the
        most obvious of such characteristics is the
        presence-absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> of the analyzed species
        in orthologous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of genes, and recently, at least
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> groups have employed this approach to build genome
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>, primarily for prokaryotes [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9 10</NUMEX> ] . An
        alternative way to construct a genome <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> involves using
        the mean or median level of similarity among all detectable
        pairs of orthologs as the measure of the evolutionary
        distance between species [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . Yet another possibility
        involves building species <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> by comparing gene orders.
        This approach had been pioneered in the classical work of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dobzhansky</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sturtevant</ENAMEX> who used inversions in 
        Drosophila chromosomes to construct
        an evolutionary tree [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . Subsequently, mathematical
        methods have been developed to calculate rearrangement
        distances between genomes, and, using these, phylogenetic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> have been built for certain small genomes, such as
        plant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mitochondria</ENAMEX> and herpesviruses [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14</NUMEX> ] . These
        approaches, however, are applicable only to genomes that
        show significant conservation of global gene order, which
        is manifestly not the case among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prokaryotes</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16 17</NUMEX> ] .
        Even relatively close species such as, for example, 
        Escherichia <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coli</ENAMEX> and 
        Haemophilus influenzae, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> species
        of the Î³-subdivision of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Proteobacteria</ENAMEX>, retain very little
        conservation of gene order beyond the operon level
        (typically, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-to-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a row</TIMEX>), and essentially
        none is detectable among evolutionarily distant bacteria
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">archaea</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16 18</NUMEX> ] . Very few operons, primarily
        those coding for physically interacting subunits of
        multiprotein <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> such as certain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal proteins</ENAMEX>
        or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA-polymerase subunits</ENAMEX>, are conserved across a wide
        range of prokaryotic lineages [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16</NUMEX> ] . On the other
        hand, pairwise comparisons of even distantly related
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prokaryotic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genomes</ENAMEX> reveal considerable number of shared
        (predicted) operons, which creates an opportunity for a
        meaningful comparative analysis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21</NUMEX> ] .
        The critical issue with all these approaches to genome
        tree <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX> is to what extent each of them reflects
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phylogeny</ENAMEX> and to what extent they are affected by other
        evolutionary processes, such as lineage-specific gene loss
        and horizontal gene transfer. Comparative analyses have
        strongly suggested that these phenomena make major
        contributions to genome evolution, at least in prokaryotes
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 22 23 24 25</NUMEX> ] . These phenomena have the potential to
        severely affecting phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree topology</ENAMEX>, particularly
        when similar sets of genes are lost indifferent lineages
        because of similar environmental pressures, or when a
        preferential trend of horizontal gene flow exists between
        different lineages. The possibility even has been discussed
        that the amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral</ENAMEX> gene exchange is such that it
        invalidates the very principle of representing the
        evolution of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>; instead, the only adequate
        representation of evolutionary history could be a complex
        network [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . Genome-<ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> seem to be the last
        resort for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> tree concept. Unless phylogenetic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> can be revealed by at least some approaches based on
        genome-wide comparisons, the conclusion seems imminent that
        this concept should be abandoned and replaced by a more
        complex representation of evolution.
        Here, we compare the topologies produced with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>,
        largely independent approaches to genome-tree <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>: i)
        presence-absence of genomes in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clusters</ENAMEX> of Orthologous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Groups</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> (COGs); <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">ii</ENAMEX>) conservation of local gene
        order (pairs of adjacent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>) among prokaryotic genomes;
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">iii</ENAMEX>) distribution of percent identity between apparent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">orthologs; iv</ENAMEX>) sequence conservation in concatenated
        alignments of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal proteins</ENAMEX>; v) comparative analysis
        of multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> reconstructed for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> protein
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>. We find that, while the presence-absence approach
        is most heavily affected by gene loss and horizontal
        transfer, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">the other four</NUMEX> methods reveal stronger
        phylogenetic signals. Although the topologies of the trees
        constructed with different approaches were only partially
        compatible, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> previously unnoticed high-level clades
        among <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> were revealed with notable consistency. We
        suggest that, in spite of all the complexity brought about
        by horizontal gene transfer and lineage-specific gene loss,
        these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> reflect certain evolutionary reality, i.e. the
        trajectory of evolution for a relatively stable gene core.
        It appears that this is the only meaningful way to treat
        the notion of a species <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>: as the history of a
        relatively large ensemble of genes, not a comprehensive
        representation of the history of entire genomes.

          New criteria for genome-tree construction
          
            Conserved gene pairs in prokaryotic
            genomes
            The results of the present analysis of conserved
            gene pairs are consistent with the notion of the
            fluidity of prokaryotic gene order caused by extensive
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">recombination</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only 17</NUMEX> invariant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> pairs were
            detected, all of which consists of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA polymerase subunits</ENAMEX>. The remaining
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4586</TIMEX> gene pairs were missing in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> genome.
            The number of gene pairs represented in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three, four and</TIMEX>
            a greater number of genomes decayed rapidly, with
            highly conserved pairs forming the tail of the
            distribution (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). The <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> quantile of this
            distribution (excluding the highly conserved pairs) was
            found to fit the geometric <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> with a high
            statistical significance (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). This is compatible
            with random, independent loss of gene pairs during
            evolution suggesting that, with the caveat of
            horizontal transfer, the number of gene pairs shared by
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genomes</ENAMEX> could reflect the evolutionary distance
            between them.
            The number of conserved gene pairs present in
            individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prokaryotic</ENAMEX> genomes varied from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">208</NUMEX> for 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> genitalium to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2314</TIMEX> for 
            P. aeruginosa (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). Analysis
            of the co-occurrence of gene pairs among the
            prokaryotic genomes shows high values of the Jaquard
            coefficient, which reflect partial conservation of gene
            order (see legend to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>), for closely related
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">species</ENAMEX>, for example, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.32</NUMEX> for 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> and 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H.</ENAMEX> influenzae and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.35</NUMEX> for 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> thermoautotrophicum and 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. jannaschi</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). The value
            of this coefficient varied from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.16 to 0.66</NUMEX>, with a
            mean of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.26</NUMEX>, for archaea, and from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.04 to 0.87</NUMEX>, with
            a mean of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.16</NUMEX>, for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>. In contrast, for
            archaeal-bacterial comparisons, the values varied from
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.04</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.18</NUMEX>, with the average of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.08</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). These
            observations appear to indicate that the distribution
            of conserved gene pairs among prokaryotic genomes
            carries a phylogenetic signal.
          
          
            Distributions of identity percentage between
            probable orthologs from complete prokaryotic
            genomes
            Figure 2shows a sampling of the distributions of
            identity percentage between pairs of apparent orthologs
            identified as reciprocal best hits from a range of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genome</ENAMEX> pairs separated by varying phylogenetic
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">distances</ENAMEX>. Most of the distributions are clearly
            unimodal, and the distributions for pairs of
            phylogenetically distant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genomes</ENAMEX>, such as those from
            different major bacterial lineages or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> versus
            archaea, have their modes within a relatively narrow
            range around <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">33%</NUMEX> identity (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
            The use of reciprocal best hits is a conservative
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> to identify the set of probable orthologs between
            pairs of genomes because some of the orthologs are
            missed due to complex relationships between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">paralogs</ENAMEX>. Nevertheless, all genome-to-genome
            comparisons included <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">at least 100</NUMEX> (for the smallest
            genomes such as the mycoplasmas), and typically, a
            considerably greater number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> pairs ( [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ]
            and data not shown). This suggests that parameters of
            the distributions of the similarity level between
            probable orthologs identified in this fashion could
            potentially serve as useful measures of the
            evolutionary distance between genomes.
          
          
            Genome <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> constructed with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> different
            approaches
            Genome <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> were generated using the approaches
            described under <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Material and Methods</ENAMEX>. All the trees
            showed a clear separation of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> major prokaryotic
            domains, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bacteria</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Archaea</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3, 4, 5</ENAMEX>). Several
            terminal bifurcations that reflect clustering of
            relatively close <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, such as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> mycoplasmas ( 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. genitalium</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M.</ENAMEX> pneumoniae and 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.</ENAMEX> urealiticum ), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> spirochetes
            ( 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. burgdorferi</ENAMEX> and 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T.</ENAMEX> pallidum ), and 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H.</ENAMEX> pylori and 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> jejuni, are also reproduced in
            all <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3, 4, 5</ENAMEX>). This retention of both the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">deepest</ENAMEX> and the terminal branchings shows that all
            types of data used for <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> construction contained at
            least a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">crude</ENAMEX> phylogenetic signal. However, beyond
            these obvious aspects of topology, and in particular
            with respect to clustering of distantly related
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> and archaea, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> produced with different
            approaches showed significant differences, which appear
            to reflect the relative contributions of phenotypic and
            phylogenetic signals. A quantitative comparison of the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree topologies</ENAMEX> using the symmetric distance method
            showed that the presence-absence tree was most
            different from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> made by the other methods
            (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>).
          
          
            Presence-absence of genomes in COGs
            The topology of the parsimony <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> built using this
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">criterion</ENAMEX> appears to reflect primarily the phenotypes
            of the respective <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). This is most
            clearly manifest in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> major bacterial clusters
            that appear in this tree, each with a strong bootstrap
            support:
            i) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> with large genomes, namely 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX>, B. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">subtilis</ENAMEX>, Synechocystis
            <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">sp.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deinococcus</ENAMEX> radiodurans and 
            Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and
            free-living <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> with small genomes, 
            A. aeolicus and 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T.</ENAMEX> maritima 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ii</ENAMEX>) parasites with small genomes (mycoplasmas,
            spirochetes, chlamydia and rickettsia)
            Parasites with moderate-sized genomes ( 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H.</ENAMEX> influenzae, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N.</ENAMEX>
            meningitidis, and 
            P. multocida; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H.</ENAMEX> pylori and 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> jejuni ) formed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> distinct
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. Thus, well-established phylogenetic
            relationships between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">free-</ENAMEX>living and parasitic
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>, such as those within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Proteobacteria</ENAMEX> ( 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli-H</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">influenzae-P.</ENAMEX> multocida-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N.</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">meningitidis</ENAMEX> ) and within low-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC Gram</ENAMEX>-positive
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> ( 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">B. subtilis-mycoplasmas</ENAMEX> ), are
            not reflected accurately in this tree <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">topology</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
            free-living <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> with small genomes, the
            hyperthermophiles 
            A. aeolicus and 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T.</ENAMEX> maritima, did not join either
            the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">free-</ENAMEX>living or the parasitic bacterial cluster,
            despite their small number of genes similar to that in
            bacterial parasites (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). That these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> do
            not <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> with the parasites despite similar genome
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sizes</ENAMEX>, suggests that it is not the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> per
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">se</ENAMEX>, but rather the degree of genome degradation and the
            loss of coherent sets of genes that affect the topology
            of the presence-absence <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>. The inclusion of the
            parasites 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> tuberculosis and 
            Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cluster</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> with large genomes probably
            reflects the recent origin of parasitism in these
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lineages</ENAMEX>. It is further notable that, in this tree, the
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> representative of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crenarchaeota</ENAMEX> ( 
            A. pernix and 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. solfataricus</ENAMEX> ) do not comprise
            a sister <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Euryarchaeota</ENAMEX> (the remaining
            archaeal <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>), but rather for am <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> within the
            Euryarchaeal cluster (see discussion below).
            In previous studies that employed similar approaches
            to genome-tree <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">building</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">phylogenetically</ENAMEX> reasonable
            clades were observed after a simple omission of
            parasitic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9</NUMEX> ] . Such an operation could be
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">applied</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, indeed resulting
            in the correct recovery of the proteobacterial and
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gram</ENAMEX>-positive bacterial lineages. However, it seems
            that, because known natural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> could be reproduced
            by this approach only after omission of certain species
            on the basis of independent prior knowledge, this
            method hardly can be useful for delineating new,
            phylogenetically sound clades.
          
          
            Conserved gene pairs
            The topology of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> based on gene pair
            conservation seems to carry a stronger phylogenetic
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> than the gene presence-absence tree because it
            correctly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> together related <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">free-</ENAMEX>living and
            parasitic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> despite major differences in gene
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">repertoires</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). The bacterial side of this tree
            consists of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> major clades: i) proteobacterial
            clade that, in addition to bona fide <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Proteobacteria</ENAMEX>,
            includes also 
            A. aeolicus, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. tuberculosis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">D.</ENAMEX>
            radiodurans, and 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Synechocystis sp</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ii</ENAMEX>)
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gram</ENAMEX>-positive clade that additionally includes 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T.</ENAMEX> maritima, and iii) an
            unexpected clade that unites spirochetes and chlamydia.
            In the archaeal domain, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> of the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crenarchaeota</ENAMEX> did not form a clade, but instead were
            present as separate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branches</ENAMEX> interspersed with
            euryarchaeal <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>. To further assess the robustness
            of the obtained <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>, we varied the parameters of the
            included <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">conserved</NUMEX> pairs by allowing distances between
            the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> comprising a pair from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0 to 5</TIMEX> and changing
            the minimal number of genomes, in which a conserved
            gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> had to be present, from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 to 4</TIMEX>. These changes
            did not significantly affect the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> topology (data
            not shown). The topology of a neighbor-joining tree
            constructed by using the number of gene pairs shared by
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> genomes to calculate the evolutionary distance
            between them was similar to the topology of the maximum
            parsimony <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2and</ENAMEX> data not shown).
            At least some unusual aspects of this tree's the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">topology</ENAMEX> could be explained by horizontal transfer of
            operons between particular bacterial and archaeal
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lineages</ENAMEX>. Specifically, it has been noticed previously
            that 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T.</ENAMEX> maritima shares a considerable
            number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and operons with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gram</ENAMEX>-positive
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>, to the exclusion of other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] ;
            this seems to be compatible with the position of 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T.</ENAMEX> maritima with the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gram</ENAMEX>-positive cluster. Similarly, considerable
            horizontal gene transfer appear to have occurred
            between the 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sulfolobus</ENAMEX> and 
            Thermoplasma lineages, which
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cluster</ENAMEX> together in the archaeal part of this <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>. The
            presence of extra <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> in the proteobacterial
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cluster</ENAMEX> is more surprising because no obvious trend for
            operon transfer between these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> and bona fide
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Proteobacteria</ENAMEX> has been noticed during systematic
            genome comparisons; however, a considerable number of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">shared</ENAMEX> gene pairs was detected during the present
            analysis (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). Artifacts of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> construction
            could also contribute to these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX>. In
            contrast, the spirochete-chlamydia clade might reflect
            a deep phylogenetic relationship (see discussion
            below).
          
          
            Parameters of percent identity distributions
            between orthologs
            Different characteristics of the distributions of
            percent identity between the probable orthologs, such
            as the mean, the median, the mode and various
            quantiles, were used to calculate distances between
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genomes</ENAMEX> and construct phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trees</ENAMEX> built
            with different cut-off values for symmetrical best
            hits, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> different formulas for the evolutionary
            distance calculation (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Methods</ENAMEX>) and
            different parameters of the distributions showed
            essentially the same topology, with strong bootstrap
            support for most of the clades (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5and data not
            shown). The complete proteobacterial and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gram</ENAMEX>-positive
            bacterial clusters were recovered in this tree as well
            as the unexpected grouping of chlamydia with spirochete
            noticed above in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> based on conserved gene pairs
            (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4, 5</ENAMEX>). Also similarly to the previous <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>,
            the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crenarchaea</ENAMEX> grouped with 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thermoplasma</ENAMEX> within the archaeal
            part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>. Beyond these groupings, the tree
            appeared conservative in the sense that the unassigned
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">bacterial species</ENAMEX> formed separate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branches</ENAMEX> near the
            root of the bacterial subtree. The closest to the root
            were the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">hyperthermophilic species</ENAMEX>, 
            A. aeolicus and 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T.</ENAMEX> maritima, which is compatible
            with the standard view of their phylogenetic position [
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 26</NUMEX> ] .
          
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alignment</ENAMEX>-based approaches to the construction of
            a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> tree
            
              Concatenated alignments of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal</ENAMEX>
              <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX>
              The alignments of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal proteins</ENAMEX>
              <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conserved</ENAMEX> in all bacterial and archaeal <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> were
              <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">concatenated</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX>-to-tail and treated as a single
              <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">alignment</ENAMEX> containing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4821</TIMEX> columns. The underlying
              assumption is that the genes coding for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal</ENAMEX>
              <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that function as components of a large
              macromolecular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> are unlikely to undergo
              horizontal transfer, which tends to confound
              comparisons of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> topologies for other protein
              <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> and would invalidate the concatenation
              approach. The resulting maximum-likelihood tree
              contains the complete proteobacterial and
              <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gram</ENAMEX>-positive bacterial clusters as well as the
              spirochete-chlamydia cluster noticed in the
              genome-<ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>. In addition to the
              spirochetes-chlamydia clade, the following
              non-trivial affinities were detected with strong
              bootstrap support: i) a cluster of the two
              hyperthemophiles, 
              A. aeolicus and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T.</ENAMEX>
              maritima, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ii</ENAMEX>) a cluster including 
              <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D.</ENAMEX> radiodurans, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Synechocystis</ENAMEX>, and
              <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. tuberculosis</ENAMEX>, which, at a deeper level, joined
              the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gram</ENAMEX>-positive bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). Similar
              <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree topologies</ENAMEX> were obtained when the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal</ENAMEX>
              protein data were analyzed using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX>-joining
              method and when bacterial phylogeny was analyzed
              separately by using a concatenated alignments of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">51</NUMEX>
              <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal proteins</ENAMEX> shared by all <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> (data not
              shown). Notably, in the quantitative comparison of
              <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree topologies</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> made of concatenated
              <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal protein</ENAMEX> alignments showed the closest
              similarity to the genome-tree based on the
              distributions of percent identity between orthologs
              (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>).
              The reliability of the observed non-trivial
              groupings was further examined by using a maximum
              likelihood approach (the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Kishino-Hasegawa</ENAMEX> test). For
              each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clade</ENAMEX> (usually, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>) forming the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> to be
              tested, <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> with alternative topologies were
              manually constructed by joining the clade in question
              to every other major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>. For example,
              to assess the support for the spirochetes-chlamydia
              grouping, spirochetes were placed, sequentially, with
              
              Thermotoga, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Aquifex</ENAMEX>, the 
              Thermotoga-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Aquifex</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX>,
              Îµ-proteobacteria, the Î±Î²Î³-proteobacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX>,
              Proteobacteria, the 
              
              Deinococcus-Synechocystis-Mycobacterium cluster,
              the low <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>+<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C Gram</ENAMEX>-positive cluster, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> that
              unites the latter <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> clusters, and between bacteria
              and archaea (to the bacterial root). The same
              alternatives were tested for chlamydia. Alternative
              topologies were compared either directly, using the
              ProtML program, or were subjected to local
              rearrangement <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>. In cases when the topology did
              not revert to the original one, the final,
              "optimized" topology was used for the comparison.
              These tests showed high stability of the 
              Thermotoga-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Aquifex</ENAMEX> and 
              
              Deinococcus-Synechocystis-Mycobacterium groupings
              (no competing topologies with likelihood within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1</TIMEX> SD
              unit from the original; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">7, 8, Table 3, 4, 5, 6</ENAMEX>).
              The affinity of the 
              
              Deinococcus-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Synechocystis-Mycobacterium</ENAMEX> with
              <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gram</ENAMEX>-positive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> also was supported, although
              an alternative topology, with this cluster joining
              <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Proteobacteria</ENAMEX> could not be ruled out (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
              <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>). Assessment of the spirochete-chlamydia grouping
              revealed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> competing topologies, albeit unusual
              ones. Specifically, moving Îµ-proteobacteria from the
              <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteobacterial</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> to the spirochete <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> or,
              alternatively, moving spirochetes with
              Îµ-proteobacteria and simultaneously moving chlamydia
              to the bacterial root results in statistically
              acceptable topologies (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 8</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>). Also, a
              minor rearrangement of the topology within the
              <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">euryarchaeal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> allowed for a reasonable
              alternative to the topology in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>(euryarchaeal
              <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">paraphyly</ENAMEX>), with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Crenarchaea</ENAMEX>-Euryarchaea
              radiation at the archaeal root (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
              <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>).
            
            
              A census of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> families
              Another approach to the "species tree" problem
              involves analysis of phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> for as many
              individual protein <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> as possible, in an
              attempt to identify a prevailing topology or at least
              common phylogenetic patterns. A survey of the COG
              <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> set identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">132</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COGs</ENAMEX>, each of which included
              a large number of bacterial and archaeal <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, but
              no or few paralogs and thus appeared to be amenable
              to a large-scale phylogenetic analysis (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 11</ENAMEX>).
              Maximum-likelihood <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> were constructed for each of
              these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COGs</ENAMEX>, and a breakdown of nearest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neighbors</ENAMEX> was
              derived for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> involved in each of
              the non-trivial or questionable branchings discussed
              above ( 
              Crenarchaea, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thermotoga, Aquifex</ENAMEX>,
              Deinococcus, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mycobacterium</ENAMEX>,
              Synechocystis, spirochetes, chlamydia, and
              Îµ-proteobacteria). In each case, a wide spread of
              topologies was observed, but the grouping that is
              observed in the concatenated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal proteins</ENAMEX> tree
              was encountered most often, although, for example,
              for the spirochete-chlamydia cluster, the lead over
              other topologies was slim (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13, 14, 15</TIMEX>).
            
          
        
      
      
        Discussion and Conclusions
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> constructed with each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> approaches
        employed here reflect both the phylogenetic signal and the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenotypic</ENAMEX> (life style) similarities or differences between
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">organisms</ENAMEX>, but the relative contributions of these two
        types of information appear to differ substantially. The
        gene presence-absence analysis seemed to be dominated by
        the phenotypic signal, primarily that from gene loss. The
        tree based on conserved gene pairs appeared to combine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phylogenetic</ENAMEX> information with major effects of horizontal
        transfer of operons. In contrast, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> based on the
        distributions of the identity level of orthologs appear to
        be more meaningful phylogenetically as indicated by the
        recovery of established high-level phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Proteobacteria</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gram</ENAMEX>-positive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>. The ability to correctly identify these major
        bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">subdivisions</ENAMEX> and the absence of obviously wrong
        groupings confer credibility to non-trivial clades present
        in these <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>, in particular the spirochete-chlamydia
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clade</ENAMEX>. The same logic applied to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> made of
        concatenated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal protein sequences</ENAMEX>, which included
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> other non-trivial bacterial groupings, 
        Aquifex-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Thermotoga</ENAMEX> and 
        
        Synechocystis-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mycobacterium-Deinococcus</ENAMEX>, the latter
        joining the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gram</ENAMEX>-positive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX>. Furthermore, extensive
        testing of alternative topologies using the
        Kishino-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hasegawa</ENAMEX> test largely supported these new bacterial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">branches</ENAMEX>. The nature of this support becomes clearer when
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> examines the results of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> family census. Each
        of the potential new clades was indeed most common among
        the observed topologies, but in no case, was the excess of
        this topology overwhelming. Taken together, these results
        seem to shed light on the very notion of a "species tree".
        It appears that, at best, a species <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> can be viewed as a
        prevailing phylogenetic trend, which, as far as deep
        branchings are concerned, may not even apply to a majority
        of the genes in a genome.
        The potential new, deep relationships between bacterial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lineages</ENAMEX> revealed during this analysis should be considered
        preliminary and treated with caution. Nevertheless, an
        evolutionary affinity between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cyanobacteria</ENAMEX> ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Synechocystis</ENAMEX> ) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Actinomycetes</ENAMEX> ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mycobacterium</ENAMEX> ) appears plausible,
        particularly given the presence, in these bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>,
        of well-developed and partly similar signal transduction
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . The connection between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
        hyperthermophilic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aquifex</ENAMEX> and 
        Thermotoga, also has obvious
        biological meaning, although, in this case, particular
        caution is due, given the possibility of preferential
        horizontal gene exchange between these <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> that
        inhabit similar environments. However, the strong support
        for this grouping obtained in the analysis of concatenated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal proteins</ENAMEX> argues against horizontal transfer as
        the primary cause for the observed topology. Although
        recent studies on the phylogeny of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal proteins</ENAMEX>
        suggest some horizontal transfer events, these seem to be
        largely restricted to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>-specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal proteins</ENAMEX>.
        In the universal set of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal proteins</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">S14</TIMEX>,
        showed clear signs of horizontal transfer [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] . The
        potential deep phylogenetic connections uncovered during
        this analysis call for detailed genome comparisons in
        search of potential shared derived <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX>, such as
        unique protein domain architectures, that could support the
        new clades.
        The major bacterial lineages are poorly resolved in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">rRNA</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2 29</ENAMEX> ] and those built using alignments
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA polymerase subunits</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] and translation
        elongation factors [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29 31</NUMEX> ] . In the currently accepted
        taxonomy, which is based primarily (but not exclusively) on
        16S <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> phylogenetic analysis, bacterial lineages that are
        suggested by this analysis to form higher-level clusters,
        tend to form primary nodes under <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bacteria</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chlamydiales</ENAMEX>,
        Spirochetales, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cyanobacteria</ENAMEX>, the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thermus-Deinococcus</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>,
        Aquificales, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thermotogales</ENAMEX>). Thus, the genome trees
        primarily suggest (however tentatively) new unifications
        based on deep phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">connections</ENAMEX>, rather than split
        already established clades. A notable exception is the
        traditional unification of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Actinomycetes</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">High G</ENAMEX>+C
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gram</ENAMEX>-positive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> (represented here by 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mycobacterium</ENAMEX> ), with low <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>+C
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gram</ENAMEX>-positive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> (the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bacillus-Clostridium</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>) under
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Firmicutes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Gram</ENAMEX>-positive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>). Such a connection was
        not supported by any of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> analyzed here, and it is
        also poorly, if at all, supported by the latest consensus
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">16S RNA</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX> S <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> and translation factor <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EF-Tu</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX> ] . Therefore it seems likely that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Firmicutes</ENAMEX> clade,
        at least in its present composition, does not exist. The
        new clade that might replace it consists of low-GC
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gram</ENAMEX>-positive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> and the potential
        Actinomycetes-Deinococcales-Cyanobacteria <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>).
        All methods of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> analysis applied here also challenge
        the traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX> of the archaeal <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">kingdom</ENAMEX> into
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Euryarchaeota</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Crenarchaeota</ENAMEX>, suggesting instead that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Euryarchaeota</ENAMEX> could be a paraphyletic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> with respect to
        Crenarchaeota, or in other words, that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crenarchaeota</ENAMEX> might
        have evolved from within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Euryarchaeota</ENAMEX>. However, the
        existence of a statistically supported alternative
        topology, with a sister<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">-group</ENAMEX> relationship between
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Euryarchaeota</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crenarchaeota</ENAMEX> allows for the possibility
        that the apparent paraphyly of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Euryarchaea</ENAMEX> is an artifact
        caused by rapid evolution in some <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Euryarchaeal</ENAMEX> lineages,
        such as 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Halobacterium</ENAMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thermoplasma</ENAMEX>. 
        An independent phylogenetic study of concatenated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal proteins</ENAMEX> has been recently published [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] . The
        main specific conclusion reported in this study was the
        apparent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of 
        Synechocystis with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gram</ENAMEX>-positive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>, although instability of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> topology
        dependent on the subset of sites used for analysis was
        noticed. Another recent study addressed the issue of a
        global tree through phylogenetic analysis of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">concatenated</ENAMEX> sets of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">orthologous proteins</ENAMEX>, for which no
        strong evidence of horizontal transfer was available [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ]
        . Notably, some of the unexpected groupings within the
        bacterial domain reported in this study coincide or overlap
        with those described here, namely, a spirochete-chlamydial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clade</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Deinococcales-Cyanobacteria</ENAMEX> clade. The grouping
        of the latter clade with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Actinomycetes</ENAMEX>, the unification of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Deinococcales-Cyanobacteria-Actinomycetes</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">clade</ENAMEX> with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gram</ENAMEX>-positive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> and the grouping of the two
        bacterial hyperthermophiles were not reproduced in the work
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">co-workers</ENAMEX>. The differences between the
        results of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> studies could owe to the differences
        between data sets analyzed, the methods used or, most
        likely, both. We should note that the present study engaged
        a substantially broader data set and more diverse methods
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> construction. We believe, however, that, in terms
        of the potential contribution of genome-wide phylogenetic
        analysis to phylogenetic taxonomy, the areas where
        different methods and independent analyses by different
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups converge</ENAMEX> might be more important than the areas of
        discrepancy. It appears that potential new clades revealed
        in such independent studies are strong <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> for new,
        high-level taxa.
        The results of the present study suggest that genome
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> based on new, integral criteria do not provide
        substantial advantages in phylogenetic reconstruction over
        more traditional, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">alignment</ENAMEX>-based methods expanded to the
        genomic scale. In fact, the latter seem to be more
        sensitive in detecting potential deep evolutionary
        relationships and this is expected to further improve with
        the increasing number of completely sequenced genomes
        becoming available for analysis. We believe, however, that
        this conclusion does not necessarily indicate that genome
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>, such as those based on representation of genomes in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">orthologous</ENAMEX> sets or conservation of gene pairs, are
        useless. In addition to revealing some new phylogenetic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">affinities</ENAMEX>, they are capable of alerting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> to
        other evolutionary phenomena, such as loss of similar gene
        sets in different <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> and preferential horizontal
        gene exchange between certain lineages.

          Phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> construction
          
            Parsimony <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> based on the presence-absence of
            conserved gene pairs in prokaryotic genomes
            The database of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clusters of Orthologous Groups of</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> (COGs) was used as the source of information
            on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">orthologous genes</ENAMEX> in prokaryotic genomes [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35 36</NUMEX> ] .
            Briefly, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COGs</ENAMEX> were constructed from the results of
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all</NUMEX>-against-all BLAST [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] comparison of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">encoded</ENAMEX> in complete genomes by detecting consistent
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of genome-specific best hits (BeTs). The COG
            construction procedure does not rely on any
            preconceived phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> of the included species
            except that certain obviously related genomes (for
            example, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> of mycoplasmas or pyrococci) were
            grouped prior to the analysis, to eliminate strong
            dependence between BeTs. In order to avoid spurious
            occurrence of the same gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX>, only gene pairs
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conserved</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> or more genomes were considered. A
            pair of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COGs</ENAMEX> was considered to be
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conserved</ENAMEX> if the respective <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were adjacent in at
            least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> genome and were separated by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">no more than two</NUMEX>
            genes in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX> additional genomes. This relaxed
            definition of a conserved gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> was adopted to take
            into account the high level of recombination in
            prokaryotic genomes. From the data on the
            presence-absence of each conserved gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> in the
            analyzed genomes (excluding pairs of closely related
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>:

            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">volcanium</ENAMEX> ), a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0/1</NUMEX> matrix analogous to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> used
            for the presence-absence of individual <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> was
            constructed, and a tree was built using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dollo</ENAMEX> parsimony
            [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] . A parsimony method was chosen for this
            analysis because the presence-absence of a conserved
            gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> in a genome can be naturally treated in terms
            of character <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Dollo</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> is based on the
            assumption that each derived character <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> (in this
            case, the presence of a gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX>) originates only
            once, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">homoplasies</ENAMEX> exist only in the form of
            reversals to the ancestral condition (absence of a gene
            pair) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] . In other words, parallel or convergent
            gains of the derived condition are assumed to be highly
            unlikely. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dollo</ENAMEX> parsimony method is not sensitive
            to gene loss which is extremely common in evolution of
            prokaryotes, but the results can be affected by
            independent acquisition of the same gene pair by
            different genome via horizontal gene transfer.
            Phylogenetic analysis was performed by using the PAUP
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.0</NUMEX> program [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] , with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX> bootstrap replicates
            performed to assess the reliability of the tree
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">topology</ENAMEX>. In addition, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> topology was analyzed
            using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX>-joining method [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> ] .
          
          
            Parsimony <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> based on the representation of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genomes</ENAMEX> in orthologous gene sets
            The information on orthologous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in prokaryotic
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genomes</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast genome</ENAMEX> was derived from the COGs
            as in the previous approach, and the orthology data
            were similarly represented as a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0/1 matrix</NUMEX> of
            presence-absence of the analyzed genomes in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COGs</ENAMEX>. A
            Dollo parsimony <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> was constructed and the
            reliability of its topology was assessed using the
            bootstrap method as described above.
          
          
            Distance <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> based on distributions of identity
            percentage between orthologous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> sequences
            The sequences of all <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> encoded in the
            analyzed genomes were compared to each other using the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gapped</ENAMEX> BLASTP program [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] . Reciprocal,
            genome-specific BeTs were collected at different
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">expectation</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">E</ENAMEX>) value cutoffs (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.01</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.001</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0001</NUMEX>,
            <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.00001</NUMEX>). This method for identification of probable
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">orthologs</ENAMEX> is, in principle, similar to the method
            employed in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COG</ENAMEX> construction, but differs in that there
            is no requirement for the formation of triangles of
            consistent BeTs. The result of this procedure is a
            conservative selection of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">orthologous</NUMEX> pairs because the
            cases of lineage-specific duplication that result in
            non-symmetrical BeTs are excluded and so are
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">orthologous</ENAMEX> pairs with very low sequence similarity.
            However, the limitation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COG</ENAMEX> system, namely the
            requirement that each orthologous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> is represented
            in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least three</NUMEX> genomes, is avoided. The
            distributions of identity percentage among the
            reciprocal best hits were derived for each pair of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>. The mean, mode, median and different quantiles
            of the identity percentage distributions were used for
            estimating evolutionary distances. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> distance
            measures were used, namely: i) P-distances calculated
            as the fraction of different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>: 
            d = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>- 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">q</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ii</ENAMEX>) Poisson distances 
            d = -1n 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">u</ENAMEX>, iii) geometric distances
            calculated using the formula 
            d = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1/</NUMEX> 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">u -1</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">iv</ENAMEX>) logarithmic
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">distances</ENAMEX> found as a solution of the equation 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">u</ENAMEX> = <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ln</ENAMEX>(<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>+<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> 
            d )/(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX> 
            d ), where 
            d is the evolutionary distance, 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">q</ENAMEX> is percent identity, and 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">u</ENAMEX> = ( 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">q -0.05</ENAMEX>)/0.95 [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41 42</NUMEX> ] [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX> ] .
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">Trees</ENAMEX> were constructed from the distance matrices
            obtained with the above distance estimates using the
            neighbor-joining method [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> ] as implemented in the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEIGHBOR</ENAMEX> program of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PHYLIP</ENAMEX> package [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> ] .
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bootstrap</ENAMEX> values were estimated by resampling the set
            of orthologs identified for each pair of genomes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX>
            times and reconstructing <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> from the distributions
            of the distances from these resampled sets.
          
          
            Maximum Likelihood <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> based on concatenated
            alignments of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal proteins</ENAMEX>
            Sets of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">orthologous ribosomal proteins</ENAMEX> were
            extracted from the COG database, and their amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>
            sequences were aligned using the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-Coffee</ENAMEX> program [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45</NUMEX>
            ] , with subsequent manual validation and removal of
            poorly aligned regions. The alignments are available
            upon request. Pairwise evolutionary distances between
            the sequences in concatenated alignments were
            calculated using the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Dayhoff PAM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> as implemented
            in the PROTDIST program of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PHYLIP</ENAMEX> package [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> ] .
            A distance tree was constructed from the resulting
            distance matrix by using the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">least-square</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX> ] method
            as implemented in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FITCH</ENAMEX> program of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PHYLIP</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> ] .
            The maximum likelihood tree was constructed with the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">JTT-F</ENAMEX> model of amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid substitutions</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX> ] , as
            implemented in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ProtML</ENAMEX> program of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MOLPHY</ENAMEX> package
            [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX> ] , by optimizing the least squares <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> with
            local rearrangements. Alternative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">topologies</ENAMEX> were
            created manually by modifications of the original tree
            and directly compared by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ProtML</ENAMEX>. Bootstrap analysis was
            performed by using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Resampling</ENAMEX> of Estimated
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Log-Likelihoods</ENAMEX> (RELL) method as implemented in ProtML
            [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48 49</NUMEX> ] .
          
          
            Comparative analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maximum Likelihood</ENAMEX> trees
            for individual protein <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative families</ENAMEX> were selected from the
            COG database according to the following criteria: i) at
            least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> are represented; <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">ii</ENAMEX>) no <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">more than two</TIMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">paralogs</ENAMEX> in any of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">iii</ENAMEX>) <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">no more than 1.2</NUMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">paralogs per genome</ENAMEX> on average; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">iv</ENAMEX>) at least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>
            positions in the alignment containing <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 30%</NUMEX> of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gaps</ENAMEX>. This selection procedure resulted in a set of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">132</NUMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> (COGs). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alignments</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">ML trees</ENAMEX> were
            constructed for these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> as described above for
            the concatenated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal proteins</ENAMEX>.
          
          
            Quantitative comparison of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> topologies
            To compare tree <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">topologies</ENAMEX> quantitatively, the
            symmetric distance between <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> ] was computed
            using the TREEDIST program of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PHYLIP</ENAMEX> package
            (version 3.6a). Briefly, each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> compared trees
            is divided by each internal branch into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> partitions.
            The symmetric distance is the number of partitions that
            are found in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> tree but not the other.
