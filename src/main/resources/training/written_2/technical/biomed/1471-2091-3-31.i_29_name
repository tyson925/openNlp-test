        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Myosin-1c</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Myo1c</NUMEX>), the myosin previously called
        myosin-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">IÎ²</ENAMEX>, myr <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MI-110K</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] , is an unconventional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">myosin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">isozyme</ENAMEX> implicated in nuclear transcription [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] ,

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ear</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . Myo1c belongs to the myosin-I class, which
        contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] ; the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bullfrog genome</ENAMEX> possesses <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Members</ENAMEX> of the myosin-I class have a single globular motor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">domain</ENAMEX>, followed by a neck <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> and a relatively short
        (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30-40</NUMEX> kD) tail domain (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1A). This latter domain is
        highly basic and binds to acidic phospholipids [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] .
        Like all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biochemically</ENAMEX> characterized unconventional
        myosins, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Myo1c</ENAMEX> binds calmodulin light <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX> in its neck
        region [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] ; this region also interacts with
        non-calmodulin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hair cells</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] .
        Unconventional myosins contain from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> to several IQ
        domains, which are calmodulin-binding motifs that adhere to
        the general consensus sequence IQX 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> RGX 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> R [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . Calmodulin, which can bind
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to four</NUMEX> Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+ions, generally binds IQ domains in the Ca
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+-free conformation; interaction of Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+-bound calmodulin
        to other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> occurs through alternative binding motifs
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] .
        Myo1c contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> readily recognized IQ motifs of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX>
        amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> each (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1C; refs. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 15 16 17 18</NUMEX> ] ).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Purified</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Myo1c</ENAMEX> apparently includes <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2-3 calmodulins</NUMEX> per
        Myo1c heavy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 20 21</NUMEX> ] ; calmodulin supplementation
        can increase the stoichiometry to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as many as 4</NUMEX> calmodulins
        per Myo1c [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . Unfortunately, the lack of appropriate
        quantitation standards for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Myo1c</TIMEX> heavy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> in those
        experiments limits the reliability of these values.
        How Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+and calmodulin regulate Myo1c or indeed any
        myosin-I is unclear. Although Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+increases ATPase
        activity of most myosin-I isozymes, 
        in vitro motility is usually blocked
        under identical conditions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+dissociates one or
        more calmodulins from the myosin-calmodulin <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>, which
        apparently elevates ATPase activity and inhibits motility [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> ] . In conventional myosin, light <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX> related to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">calmodulin</ENAMEX> appear to be essential for stabilization of the
        myosin <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lever arm</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] , a domain that is vital for
        efficient conversion of chemical energy into mechanical
        work [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calmodulin</ENAMEX> probably plays a similar lever-arm
        stabilizing role for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Myo1c</TIMEX>; Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+-induced calmodulin
        release would reverse the stabilization and inhibit
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">motility</ENAMEX>.
        To better understand the regulation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Myo1c</TIMEX> activity by
        calmodulin, we sought to more accurately determine how
        calmodulin binds to Myo1c by measuring the Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+-dependence
        of calmodulin binding to individual Myo1c IQ peptides. In
        addition, to examine the consequences of calmodulin binding
        to adjacent IQ domains, we measured hydrodynamic properties
        of recombinant Myo1c-calmodulin <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX>, under differing
        conditions of Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+, calmodulin, and temperature. These
        measurements allowed us to determine the molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mass</ENAMEX> and
        hence stoichiometry of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Myo1c</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>. Our results
        indicate that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IQ1</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IQ2</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IQ3</ENAMEX> have calmodulin bound when
        the concentration of Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+is low, and that increased Ca
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+induces release of calmodulin from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IQ1 and IQ2</TIMEX>.
      
      
        Results
        
          Sequence analysis of IQ domains
          Examination of the primary sequence of the bullfrog
          Myo1c neck region reveals an exact repeat of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> amino
          acids located both in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">IQ3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YRNQP</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">761-765</ENAMEX>) and at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">residues 786-790</ENAMEX>. Alignment of the
          residues surrounding the repeat revealed reasonable
          homology with the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> known IQ domains, with particular
          similarity to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IQ3</TIMEX>, suggesting that this region may be a
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> IQ domain (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1C). Although the pair of amino
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">acids</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LM</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues 782</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">783</NUMEX>) that align with the RG
          of the IQ consensus motif are not conserved, the first
          pair of amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IR</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues 777</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">778</NUMEX>) that align
          with the consensus IQ adhere to the consensus better than
          those of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IQ3</TIMEX>. Because of the sequence similarity to IQ3
          and because this peptide binds calmodulin (albeit weakly;
          see below), we refer to this domain as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IQ4</TIMEX>.
        
        
          IQ - Alexa-calmodulin interaction on plastic
          plates
          To investigate the calmodulin-binding properties of
          each Myo1c IQ domain, we measured interaction of a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fluorescently</ENAMEX> labeled calmodulin (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alexa-calmodulin</ENAMEX>) with
          individual Myo1c IQ peptides that had been conjugated to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">wells</ENAMEX> of a plastic plate. We used an IQ peptide from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neuromodulin</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] as a positive control; calmodulin
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">binds</ENAMEX> to this site, with its interaction reduced by high
          ionic strength [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 25</NUMEX> ] . As a negative control, we used
          a peptide (PVP), corresponding to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> of
          Myo1c immediately following <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IQ4</TIMEX>. Indeed, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alexa</ENAMEX>-calmodulin
          bound to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wells</ENAMEX> derivatized with the neuromodulin IQ
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">peptide</ENAMEX> and did not bind to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PVP</ENAMEX> peptide (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          2A).
          Substantial amounts of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alexa</ENAMEX>-calmodulin bound to wells
          derivatized with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IQ1</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IQ2</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IQ3</TIMEX>; by contrast,
          relatively little bound to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IQ4</NUMEX>-coated <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">wells</ENAMEX> under these
          conditions (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2A). As has been noted for the
          neuromodulin IQ domain [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] , increasing the KCl
          concentration reduced binding to each IQ peptide.
          Although the data shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2Awere obtained at room
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">temperature</ENAMEX>, we saw a similar rank order of binding -
          albeit with lower total Alexa-calmodulin bound - at 4Â°C
          (data not shown).
          To confirm the approximate binding strength reported
          by this assay, we used free IQ peptides to prevent
          Alexa-calmodulin binding to an IQ3-derivatized plate.
          Because the IQ peptides strongly quenched
          Alexa-calmodulin fluorescence when bound, we corrected
          fluorescence measurements using an identical assay in an
          underivatized plate. Although this quenching correction
          introduced substantial scatter into the data, we found
          that the apparent affinities for binding of peptides to
          Alexa-calmodulin followed the order <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IQ3 > IQ1 â</ENAMEX> IQ2
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">></ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IQ4</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2B).
        
        
          IQ - calmodulin interaction by quenching of
          Alexa-calmodulin fluorescence
          As noted above, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alexa</ENAMEX>-calmodulin fluorescence was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">quenched</ENAMEX> upon binding to an IQ peptide (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3A). Because
          an excess of unlabeled calmodulin was able to reverse
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70-95%</NUMEX> of the quench (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3A), we inferred that most
          Alexa-calmodulin bound to the same site as unlabeled
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">calmodulin</ENAMEX>. We used this fluorescence-intensity quench
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">empirically</ENAMEX> to measure the affinity of each IQ peptide
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alexa-calmodulin</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3B). In some experiments, Ca
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+was held at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"><30</NUMEX> nM by chelation with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100 Î</NUMEX>¼M <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGTA</ENAMEX>; in
          other experiments, we added <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> Î¼M exogenous CaCl 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> in the absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGTA</ENAMEX>. These two
          concentrations mimic the low- and high-Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+conditions
          that Myo1c may encounter in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hair cells</ENAMEX> when the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transduction</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> is closed or open [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] . In the
          presence of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100 Î</NUMEX>¼M <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGTA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          d values followed the order IQ3 <
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">IQ1 â IQ2 << IQ4.</ENAMEX> Although the data were fit
          somewhat better with a modified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hill</ENAMEX> equation that with a
          standard bimolecular-binding isotherm (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3B), the
          physiological significance of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hill</ENAMEX> coefficients <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">>1</NUMEX> is
          uncertain, particularly given the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 peptide:calmodulin</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stoichiometry</ENAMEX> (see below). Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+had only modest effects
          on the affinity of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Myo1c</NUMEX> IQ peptides for
          Alexa-calmodulin (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>).
          Despite only minor effects on binding affinity, Ca
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+did influence the calmodulin-peptide <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>, as
          signaled by changes in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alexa</ENAMEX>-calmodulin fluorescence.
          Changes in fluorescence intensity during manipulation of
          a single parameter, like Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+concentration, should
          report conformational changes in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alexa</ENAMEX>-calmodulin. For
          example, the fluorescence intensity of free
          Alexa-calmodulin in solution was ~<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15%</NUMEX> lower in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25 Î</TIMEX>¼M CaCl
          
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX> than in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> Î¼M EGTA (left-hand
          limits in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). Because the dye moiety itself is not
          Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+sensitive [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] , the Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+-dependent fluorescent
          change reflects changes in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">dye</ENAMEX>'s surrounding
          environment, probably signaling the compact-to-open
          structural change seen when Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+binds to calmodulin [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</NUMEX>
          ] . In contrast to the reduction of free Alexa-calmodulin
          fluorescence by Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+, fluorescence of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alexa</ENAMEX>-calmodulin
          when saturated by IQ peptides was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5- to 2</NUMEX>-fold 
          greater in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25 Î</TIMEX>¼M CaCl 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX> than in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> Î¼M EGTA (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Thus, when Alexa-calmodulin was bound to IQ peptides,
          Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+induced a conformational change that was
          substantially different from that seen in the
          peptide-free <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          IQ - calmodulin interaction under
          stoichiometric-titration conditions
          To determine the affinities of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Myo1c</NUMEX> IQ peptides
          for unlabeled calmodulin, we used Alexa-calmodulin as a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Alexa</ENAMEX>-calmodulin : unlabeled calmodulin ratio
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">100</ENAMEX>) in our binding studies. This approach assumes
          that Alexa-calmodulin is functionally equivalent to
          unlabeled calmodulin.
          We determined affinities by fitting the IQ-peptide
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">concentration</ENAMEX> vs. fluorescence quench data with an
          appropriate model. If the IQ peptides bound only
          Alexa-calmodulin and not unlabeled calmodulin, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          d and F 
          IQ /F values of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1would</ENAMEX> have
          described the fit to the concentration-quench plots. The
          line derived from these values did not fit the data (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>), indicating that, as expected, unlabeled calmodulin
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">binds</ENAMEX> to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Myo1c</NUMEX> IQ peptides.
          These experimental conditions resembled a
          stoichiometric titration, where the total concentration
          of calmodulin was higher than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          d values for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IQ1</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IQ2</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IQ3</TIMEX>. Under
          true stoichiometric-titration conditions (fixed
          concentration of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>-fold or more than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          d , varying the ligand concentration
          up to and beyond the receptor concentration), almost all
          of the added IQ peptide would bind tightly to calmodulin
          and linearly decrease the fluorescence; at the point
          where the IQ-peptide concentration exceeds the calmodulin
          concentration multiplied by the peptide:calmodulin
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stoichiometry</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> ), a plateau in the fluorescence
          intensity would be reached. Because the relatively weak
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">affinities</ENAMEX> observed here make such true stoichiometric
          titration impractical, we used an intermediate
          concentration of calmodulin (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 Î¼M</NUMEX>, ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10-fold</NUMEX> larger than
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          d ) and used equation (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">7</ENAMEX>) to describe
          the equilibrium precisely. This approach allowed us to
          determine both 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          d in the same experiment.
          In the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGTA</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the IQ1</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IQ2</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IQ3</ENAMEX> binding
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> were much better fit by 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">m = 1</ENAMEX> than they were to 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, indicating that the binding
          stoichiometry of peptide to calmodulin was <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1:1</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>).
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          d values determined with equation (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">7</ENAMEX>)
          were very similar to those determined for binding to
          Alexa-calmodulin alone (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tables 1and 2</ENAMEX>), confirming that
          under these conditions, the IQ peptides bind to unlabeled
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">calmodulin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alexa</ENAMEX>-calmodulin similarly.
          In the presence of Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IQ3</ENAMEX> also bound to calmodulin
          with a stoichiometry of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1:1</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). The fits to 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 and 2</NUMEX> were equally good for
          IQ1 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IQ2</ENAMEX> in the presence of Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+, signifying the
          inability for this analysis to determine precise binding
          stoichiometry of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IQ1 and IQ2</TIMEX> under these conditions. In
          addition, these data indicate that the apparent
          affinities of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IQ1 and IQ2</TIMEX> for unlabeled calmodulin were
          substantially weakened by Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+(<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>), unlike results
          with Alexa-calmodulin alone (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). Because the
          assumption that affinities of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alexa-calmodulin</ENAMEX> and
          unlabeled calmodulin for IQ peptides are identical was
          violated for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IQ1 and IQ2</TIMEX>, the actual affinities of these
          IQ peptides for unlabeled calmodulin may be even weaker
          than those reported in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>. By contrast, Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+had
          only a very modest effect on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IQ3</TIMEX> affinity for unlabeled
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">calmodulin</ENAMEX>.
          Binding of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IQ4</NUMEX> to unlabeled calmodulin was distinct
          from that of the other IQ peptides. The data with IQ4
          were best fit with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hill</ENAMEX> equation (equation <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4</NUMEX>), with a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hill</ENAMEX> coefficient of greater than 2 (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>, thick solid
          lines), suggesting that binding of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> peptides per
          calmodulin may be required for the fluorescence change.
          The apparent affinities (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">~100 Î¼M</ENAMEX>) were similar to the
          concentration of calmodulin (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 Î¼M</NUMEX>), however, indicating
          that the apparent affinities did not accurately reflect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX>
          
          d values. These results with a mixture
          of unlabeled and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alexa</ENAMEX>-calmodulin were different from
          those with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alexa-calmodulin</ENAMEX> alone, where IQ4 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hill</ENAMEX>
          coefficients were <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">close to 1</NUMEX> (data not shown).
          Nevertheless, these data show that unlabeled calmodulin
          can bind to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IQ4</TIMEX>, albeit with weak affinity and uncertain
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stoichiometry</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Hydrodynamic analysis of full-length Myo1c
          To determine the stoichiometry and Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+-dependent
          regulation of calmodulin binding to <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Myo1c</NUMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all four</NUMEX>
          IQ motifs, we co-expressed calmodulin and full-length
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bullfrog</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Myo1c</ENAMEX> in insect cells using baculoviruses and
          subjected the purified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Myo1c</NUMEX>-calmodulin <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          1B) to hydrodynamic analysis (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). We carried out
          velocity sedimentation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Myo1c</NUMEX>-calmodulin <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> on
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> sucrose gradients to determine sedimentation
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coefficients</ENAMEX>. We measured the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stokes</ENAMEX> radius of
          Myo1c-calmodulin <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> using gel filtration on
          Superdex <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> under temperature and buffer conditions
          identical to those of the velocity-sedimentation
          experiments (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). Although most experiments used <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mM KCl</ENAMEX> (which prevented adsorption to the gel-filtration
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">matrix</ENAMEX>), we obtained identical sedimentation coefficients
          in the presence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">150</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KCl</ENAMEX> (not shown).
          Velocity-sedimentation and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gel-filtration</ENAMEX> experiments
          were carried out at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4Â°C</TIMEX>, the temperature used for Myo1c
          purification, as well as at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25Â°C</TIMEX>, a physiologically
          relevant temperature for a bullfrog.
          To calculate the molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mass</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Myo1c</NUMEX>-calmodulin
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">complexes</ENAMEX>, we applied the modified Svedberg equation,
          which relates mass to the diffusion constant (calculated
          here from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Stokes radius</NUMEX>) and the sedimentation
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coefficient</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] . The partial specific volume of each
          protein complex was determined using the amino-acid
          composition of the constituent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>; ref. [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> ] ). Although the uncertainty in calmodulin
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stoichiometry</ENAMEX> leads to ambiguity in this calculation, the
          calculated partial specific volumes were so close ( 
          e.g. , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.734</NUMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">one and 0.731</NUMEX> for
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> calmodulins per Myo1c <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>) that the precise
          value did not significantly affect the final
          molecular-mass value.
          Full-length Myo1c bound ~<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 calmodulins per Myo1c</NUMEX> at
          4Â°C in the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGTA</ENAMEX> or CaCl 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the bound
          calmodulins was only weakly associated, as elevation of
          the temperature to 25Â°C induced the release of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> mole of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">calmodulin</ENAMEX> in the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGTA</ENAMEX>. When Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+was
          elevated to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">25 Î</NUMEX>¼M at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25Â°C</TIMEX>, however, we could not detect
          substantial full-length Myo1c in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solution</ENAMEX> after
          sucrose-gradient centrifugation or gel filtration,
          suggesting that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> had aggregated.
        
        
          Hydrodynamic analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T701-Myo1</ENAMEX>c
          Because the size of full-length Myo1c (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">125</NUMEX> kD,
          including purification and detection tags) is much larger
          than calmodulin (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">16.7 kD</NUMEX>), we improved our ability to
          determine stoichiometry from molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mass</ENAMEX> by examining
          a smaller (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">45 kD</NUMEX>) neck-tail recombinant fragment of
          Myo1c. This construct, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T701-Myo1c</ENAMEX>, contained amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">701-1028</ENAMEX> of bullfrog <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Myo1c</TIMEX>, including <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all four</NUMEX> IQ
          domains, the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal tail, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">purification</ENAMEX> and epitope tags (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1A,1<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B</ENAMEX>).
          T701-Myo1c bound <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.5 moles of calmodulin</NUMEX> per mole of
          heavy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">4Â°C</NUMEX> in the presence of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100 Î¼M</NUMEX> EGTA (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>). As with full-length <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Myo1c</TIMEX>, elevation of the
          analysis temperature to 25Â°C induced the release of ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.7</NUMEX>
          mole of calmodulin. In contrast to the results seen with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">full-length Myo1c</ENAMEX>, elevation of the CaCl 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> concentration to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">25 Î</NUMEX>¼M at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">4Â°C</NUMEX> also
          induced the release of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~0.7 mole of calmodulin</NUMEX>. The
          amount of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">T701</NUMEX>-calmodulin complex recovered on sucrose
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gradients</ENAMEX> or by gel filtration decreased substantially
          when the CaCl 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> concentration was elevated to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">25 Î</NUMEX>¼M
          at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25Â°C</TIMEX>, signaling the formation of aggregates, as seen
          with the full-length complex. Furthermore, the calculated
          calmodulin stoichiometry of the observed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">T701</NUMEX>-calmodulin
          complex under these conditions was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only ~0.3 mole</NUMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">calmodulin per mole</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Myo1c</TIMEX>, reinforcing the suggestion
          that Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+induced the dissociation of most calmodulins at
          25Â°C and that this loss of light chains resulted in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aggregation</ENAMEX>.
          We could not prevent the release of calmodulin at 25Â°C
          by saturating <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T701-Myo1c</ENAMEX> with excess calmodulin
          immediately prior to centrifugation (preloading). In
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGTA</ENAMEX>, the sedimentation coefficient of
          calmodulin-preloaded <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T701-Myo1c</ENAMEX> measured at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25Â°C</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3.85</NUMEX> Â±
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">0.07 S; n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) was nearly identical to that measured
          without preloading (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.83</NUMEX> S; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>). Likewise, the
          sedimentation coefficient of calmodulin-preloaded
          T701<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-Myo1c</ENAMEX> measured at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25Â°C</TIMEX> and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25 Î</TIMEX>¼M CaCl 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.80</NUMEX> Â± <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.42</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S; n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) was similar
          to that measured without preloading (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.13</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S; Table</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>).
          By contrast, we could prevent the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">temperature-dependent</ENAMEX> loss of calmodulin by carrying out
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sedimentation</ENAMEX> in the continuous presence of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 Î</NUMEX>¼M
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">calmodulin</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6C,6<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5</ENAMEX>). Although gel-filtration
          analysis was impractical with this high calmodulin
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">concentration</ENAMEX>, we assumed that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stokes</ENAMEX> radius of
          T701-Myo1c in the presence of calmodulin was identical to
          the value obtained in the absence. Sedimentation at 25Â°C
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGTA</ENAMEX> gradients supplemented with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 Î¼M</NUMEX> calmodulin
          resulted in the retention of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~3 calmodulins</NUMEX> per
          T701<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">-Myo1c.</ENAMEX> In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25 Î</TIMEX>¼M CaCl 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , supplementation with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 Î</NUMEX>¼M
          calmodulin resulted in <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~1</NUMEX> calmodulin bound per
          T701<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">-Myo1c.</ENAMEX> In addition, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> loss due to aggregation
          was minimal under these conditions.
        
        
          Myo1c-calmodulin stoichiometry by gel
          scanning
          To measure Myo1c-calmodulin stoichiometry by an
          independent method, we separated calmodulin standards and
          T701<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-Myo1c</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX>-PAGE (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 7A). Using densitometry, we
          quantified the staining intensity of the calmodulin
          standards to generate a standard curve (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 7B) and
          determined the amount of calmodulin present in each
          T701-Myo1c sample. Applying the analysis described in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Experimental Procedures</ENAMEX> and equation (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">13</NUMEX>), we found an
          average of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2.6 Â± 0.2 calmodulins per</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T701-Myo1c</ENAMEX> (mean Â±
          standard error) in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> experiments, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> separate
          preparations analyzed in duplicate. This value was very
          close to the value of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.5 Â± 0.1</NUMEX> bound calmodulins
          determined independently by hydrodynamic analysis (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>).
        
      
      
        Discussion
        
          Calmodulin interaction with individual Myo1c IQ
          domains
          To examine how calmodulin binds to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Myo1c</NUMEX> IQ sites,
          we developed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> binding assays using a commercially
          available fluorescent calmodulin and individual IQ
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">peptides</ENAMEX>. In one assay, we covalently attached peptides
          to plastic plates, then measured the amount of
          fluorescent calmodulin that remained unbound after
          incubation with the peptide-derivatized plate. This assay
          was simple and fast, and allowed us to measure binding
          under a wide variety of conditions. In our <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> assay,
          we exploited the empirical observation that the
          Alexa-calmodulin fluorescence intensity is quenched by
          binding of IQ peptides. As in other assays with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fluorescently</ENAMEX> labeled calmodulins (e.g., ref. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] ),
          binding of the peptides to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alexa-calmodulin</ENAMEX> did not
          perfectly mimic binding to unlabeled calmodulin. For
          example, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alexa</ENAMEX>-calmodulin bound IQ peptides more strongly
          in the presence of Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+than did unlabeled calmodulin.
          Moreover, excess unlabeled calmodulin could not fully
          reverse the quenching of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alexa</ENAMEX>-calmodulin fluorescence
          induced by IQ peptides, suggesting that IQ peptides could
          bind to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alexa</ENAMEX>-calmodulin at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX>, including one
          where unlabeled calmodulin could not bind. Indeed,
          binding of IQ peptides to both <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> on a single
          fluorescent calmodulin could account for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hill</ENAMEX>
          coefficients of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">>1</NUMEX> seen in some experiments (e.g.,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Figs. 3Band 4</ENAMEX>). Nevertheless, these discrepancies should
          not prevent use of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alexa</ENAMEX>-calmodulin for measuring
          interaction with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">calmodulin</ENAMEX>'s targets, particularly if
          the interaction with unlabeled calmodulin is compared to
          the interaction with Alexa-calmodulin.
          Calmodulin bound to peptides corresponding to each of
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> Myo1c IQ domains, although with differing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">affinity</ENAMEX> and Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+sensitivity. Affinities for calmodulin
          binding to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IQ1 and IQ2</TIMEX> were relatively modest (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          d values of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~5 Î¼M</NUMEX>). As with other IQ
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">domains</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] , Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+weakened the affinity of calmodulin
          for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IQ1 and IQ2</TIMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 10-fold</NUMEX>.
          By contrast, calmodulin binding to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IQ3</TIMEX> was slightly
          stronger and was affected much less by Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+. Because
          calmodulin binds strongly to classic IQ domains only in
          the absence of Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+ [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 32</NUMEX> ] , its strong binding to
          IQ3 in the presence of Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+suggests the participation of
          an additional Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+-requiring binding motif. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> common
          calmodulin-binding motifs, called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1-8-14</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1-5-10</ENAMEX> for
          the pattern of hydrophobic amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid residues</ENAMEX>, require
          Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+for calmodulin binding [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . IQ3 has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> nearly
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">perfect 1-5-10</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">domains</ENAMEX> that are at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">+2</NUMEX> net charge instead
          of the minimum <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">+3</NUMEX> in the consensus [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . In addition,
          IQ3 has a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1-8-14</ENAMEX> motif with a proline <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> at position
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> instead of phenylalanine, isoleucine, leucine, valine,
          or tryptophan. Because most <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that bind calmodulin
          through the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1-8-14</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1-5-10</ENAMEX> motifs do so strongly, the
          relatively modest affinity of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IQ3</ENAMEX> for calmodulin in the
          presence of Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+suggests that calmodulin binds through
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of these imperfect motifs located within this IQ
          domain. To interact with an alternate set of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>, Ca
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+-calmodulin must adopt a new conformation. A similar Ca
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+-dependent rearrangement was predicted for the complex
          of calmodulin and the first IQ domain of myosin-1a
          (brush-border myosin I) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] .
          In support of this view, we observed evidence for Ca
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+-dependent conformational changes in calmodulin while
          bound to IQ peptides. When <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alexa</ENAMEX>-calmodulin was bound to
          Myo1c IQ peptides, its fluorescence was higher in the
          presence of Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+than in its absence, suggesting that
          that Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+-bound Alexa-calmodulin binds to the IQ
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">peptides</ENAMEX> in a different conformation than does Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+-free
          Alexa-calmodulin. For example, in the absence of Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+,
          Alexa-calmodulin may bind to IQ peptides in a more
          compact <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">conformation</ENAMEX>, quenching fluorescence by burying
          dye moieties in a less polar environment. Although the Ca
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+-induced conformational change could be a property of
          Alexa-calmodulin rather than calmodulin itself, the Ca
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+-dependent changes in affinity of calmodulin for IQ1
          and IQ2 (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">calmodulin</ENAMEX>'s likely shift to a new
          binding site on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IQ3</TIMEX> suggests that the conformational
          change is probably also a property of authentic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">calmodulin</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calmodulin</ENAMEX> also bound to a newly identified domain,
          IQ4. Because the affinity of calmodulin for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IQ4</TIMEX> is very
          weak, calmodulin should only occupy IQ4 in subcellular
          locations with a low Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+concentration and a high level
          of free calmodulin. For example, a small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of
          Myo1c molecules with calmodulin bound to IQ4 should be
          present in the stereocilia of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inner-ear hair cells</ENAMEX>, which
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">contain ~</ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> Î¼M free calmodulin [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] . Although most
          tissues contain less free calmodulin [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] ,
          concentrations in other individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">organelles</ENAMEX> can reach
          the millimolar range [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] . On the other hand, the weak
          affinity of this IQ domain for calmodulin suggests that
          IQ4 may play another role, such as interacting with
          another <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Calmodulin interaction with Myo1c
          The binding affinities of calmodulin for the
          individual IQ peptides do not reflect exactly the
          affinities of calmodulin for the IQ domains within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Myo1c</TIMEX>.
          For example, despite micromolar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          d values for calmodulin-IQ peptide
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interactions</ENAMEX>, calmodulin remains bound to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Myo1c</NUMEX> during
          long gel-filtration or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">centrifugation</ENAMEX> experiments, even
          at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">nanomolar Myo1c</TIMEX> concentrations (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). This result
          suggests that calmodulin binds to some of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Myo1c</TIMEX>'s <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tandem</ENAMEX> IQ domains substantially more strongly than to the
          individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">peptides</ENAMEX>. For example, other regions of Myo1c
          could constrain the IQ domains in conformations that are
          substantially more (or less) favorable for calmodulin
          binding than the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of conformations adopted by a
          soluble IQ peptide. Moreover, calmodulin binding to Myo1c
          could be influenced by interactions with adjacent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">calmodulin</ENAMEX> molecules or to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Myo1c</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> or tail
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">domains</ENAMEX>.
          To examine calmodulin binding to IQ domains in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Myo1c</TIMEX>,
          we determined the molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mass</ENAMEX> (and hence
          calmodulin:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Myo1c stoichiometry</ENAMEX>) and shape of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Myo1c</ENAMEX> under
          the appropriate conditions of temperature and Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+.
          Although analytical ultracentrifugation is more commonly
          used to measure molecular size of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-protein
          complexes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] , we instead used classic hydrodynamic
          methods of velocity sedimentation on sucrose gradients to
          obtain sedimentation coefficients and gel filtration to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">obtain Stokes</ENAMEX>' radius. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> advantage of this approach was
          that by detecting <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Myo1c</ENAMEX> using a sensitive ELISA method,
          we were able to use very low concentrations of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Myo1c</TIMEX>.
          Furthermore, we were able to carry out sedimentation in
          the presence of a high concentration of calmodulin, a
          manipulation that prevents Myo1c <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">detection</ENAMEX> in a standard
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">analytical</ENAMEX> ultracentrifugation experiment. A disadvantage
          of this approach was the need for high concentrations of
          sucrose, which in rare conditions can substantially
          affect the hydrodynamic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">properties</ENAMEX> of a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] ;
          nevertheless, changes in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Myo1c</TIMEX> size were observed both in
          velocity sedimentation (in the presence of sucrose) and
          in gel filtration (in its absence). Another disadvantage
          of our classic approach to molecular-mass determination
          was that the gel filtration and velocity sedimentations
          were done on different time scales (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">~1 hour</TIMEX> vs. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15-18</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX>). If <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">calmodulin</ENAMEX> slowly dissociated during the
          analysis (which in both assays diluted Myo1c well below <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Î¼M</ENAMEX>), the degree of dissociation would be larger in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">velocity sedimentation</ENAMEX> experiments than in the gel
          filtration experiments. Nevertheless, our approach was
          validated by the demonstration that the number of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">calmodulins per</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T701-Myo1c</ENAMEX> was identical in hydrodynamic
          and gel-scanning experiments, at least in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGTA</ENAMEX> at
          4Â°C.
          Because <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T701-Myo1c</ENAMEX> mimicked <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">properties</ENAMEX> of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">full-length protein</ENAMEX> (except under low-temperature,
          high-Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+conditions), we exploited the neck-tail
          construct for a more detailed analysis of calmodulin
          binding. As expected from the large Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+-dependent
          weakening of calmodulin affinity for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IQ1 and IQ2</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>;
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Table 2</ENAMEX>), Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+decreased the number of calmodulins bound
          to T701-Myo1c at high ionic strength. When Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+was low
          at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25Â°C</TIMEX>, each <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">T701</NUMEX>-Myo1c had about two bound calmodulins,
          with a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> bound if the calmodulin concentration
          reached <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> Î¼M. At this calmodulin concentration, IQ
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">domains 1, 2</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> are likely occupied by calmodulin.
          When Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+is high at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25Â°C</TIMEX>, all but one calmodulin
          dissociated from <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T701-Myo1c</ENAMEX> in the presence of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 Î</NUMEX>¼M free
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">calmodulin</ENAMEX>. The strong affinity of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IQ3</ENAMEX> for Ca
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+-calmodulin suggests that the remaining calmodulin was
          bound to this IQ domain.
          How many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">calmodulins</ENAMEX> are bound to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Myo1c</NUMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> at
          increased Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+concentrations? The elevated ionic
          strength used for the hydrodynamic analysis probably
          weakened the affinity of the calmodulin for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IQ3</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          2A), requiring <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> Î¼M free calmodulin to maintain occupancy
          of that site. We therefore infer that at a
          physiologically significant temperature and at a cellular
          ionic strength, Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+triggers release of calmodulins from
          IQ1 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IQ2</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T701-Myo1c</ENAMEX>, leaving only IQ3 occupied.
          Although these results contrast with those reported for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mammalian Myo1c</ENAMEX>, where <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> calmodulins is
          released by Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+ [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 38</NUMEX> ] , our T701 construct lacks
          Myo1c's motor domain. It is entirely plausible that even
          in the presence of Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+, calmodulin remains bound to
          IQ1, albeit in a different conformation and dependent on
          interactions with the myosin <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX>. Our results therefore
          suggest that Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+either induces the release of
          calmodulin from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IQ1</TIMEX> or causes it to change its
          interaction with Myo1c substantially.
          Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> calmodulins bound to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Myo1c</TIMEX>, one of these
          binds relatively weakly at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25Â°C</TIMEX>, even in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGTA</ENAMEX>. To which
          IQ domain does this weakly bound light chain bind?
          Although calmodulin binds to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IQs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1-3</ENAMEX> with approximately
          the same strength in the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EGTA</ENAMEX>, we suggest
          that the readily released calmodulin is likely to be that
          bound to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IQ2</TIMEX>. To bind <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> calmodulins, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IQs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1-3</ENAMEX>, each of
          which are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 23</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> long, must be arranged
          without kinks [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] ; this arrangement may produce
          unfavorable strain on each of the calmodulin molecules.
          Release of calmodulin from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IQ2</TIMEX> would relieve all of that
          strain; release from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">IQs 1</NUMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3</NUMEX> would not. Strain relief
          also may accelerate calmodulin release in the presence of
          Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+; because Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+apparently rearranges the
          three-dimensional interaction of calmodulin with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IQ3</TIMEX>,
          binding of an adjacent calmodulin - on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IQ2</NUMEX> - might be
          destabilized even more [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] .
          Despite the loss of calmodulin from T701-Myo1c induced
          by elevation of the temperature from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4Â°C</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25Â°C</TIMEX>, the
          frictional ratio (a measure of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>'s asymmetry)
          increased (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>). The neck-tail region of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Myo1c</ENAMEX> thus
          appears to adopt a compact <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4Â°C</TIMEX>, becoming
          more extended at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25Â°C</TIMEX>. Less calmodulin may be released at
          lower temperatures because the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Myo1c</NUMEX> tail may bind to and
          stabilize <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">calmodulin</ENAMEX>'s interaction with the Myo1c
          neck.
        
        
          Implications for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Myo1c</TIMEX> activity
          The Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+-dependent change in interaction of
          calmodulin with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IQ1</TIMEX>, the IQ domain closest to the motor
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">domain</ENAMEX>, has important implications for Myo1c
          mechanochemical function. Although Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+increases Myo1c
          ATPase activity, the ion completely halts 
          in vitro motility [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . Ca
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+-dependent changes in conformation may prevent
          amplification of a small converter-domain movement into a
          large motor step. In the presence of an external <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX>,
          as is seen by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Myo1c</TIMEX> during an excitatory mechanical
          stimulus in a hair cell [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] , Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+(which enters the
          cell through open transduction channels), should permit
          Myo1c to go through its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATPase</ENAMEX> cycle, binding and
          unbinding from actin, but the altered interaction of
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">calmodulin and IQ1</TIMEX> may prevent force production by the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">motor</ENAMEX>. We predict that Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+will decrease the stiffness
          of a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Myo1c</NUMEX>-actin interaction, preventing coupling of the
          energy released by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> hydrolysis to the swing of the
          neck [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> ] . This behavior will assist <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Myo1c</TIMEX> in its role
          of adaptation in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hair cells</ENAMEX>, where the motor reduces
          force applied to the hair cell's transduction
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">channel</ENAMEX>.
          A limitation of our experiments is the restriction of
          Myo1c binding to a single type of light <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">calmodulin</ENAMEX>. Other light <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX> can interact with IQ
          domains, including essential light chain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">isoforms</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ]
          and calmodulin-like <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ] . Although purified
          bovine adrenal <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Myo1c</ENAMEX> does not appear to have alternative
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> light <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] , we can not rule out the
          possibility that other light chains bind in a cellular
          context. Nevertheless, purified recombinant full-length
          Myo1c associated with calmodulin light chains exhibited
          actin-activated ATPase activity and motility 
          in vitro [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX> ] , indicating that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">calmodulin</ENAMEX> can function as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Myo1c</ENAMEX> light <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX>.
          That Myo1c does not bind calmodulin tightly is, at
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> glance, surprising. Weak calmodulin binding may,
          however, permit access of IQ domains to intracellular
          Myo1c <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>. Accordingly, we have found that a Myo1c
          fragment containing only <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IQs</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1-3</ENAMEX>, partially complexed
          with calmodulin, binds avidly to hair-cell <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>;
          excess <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">calmodulin</ENAMEX> blocks this interaction, probably by
          binding to an unoccupied IQ site on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Myo1c</TIMEX> fragment [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> ] . IQ2 is highly conserved between <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, leading
          us to propose that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hair-cell receptors interact</ENAMEX> through
          this region [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . Because Myo1c-interacting proteins
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hair cells</ENAMEX> and elsewhere may interact through IQ
          domains, regulation of calmodulin binding to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Myo1c</NUMEX> - for
          example, by Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+- likely affects coupling of the motor
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> to its cargo.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        Under low Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+conditions and normal ionic strength,
        calmodulin binds moderately tightly to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> Myo1c IQ
        domains, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IQ1</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IQ2</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">IQ3</TIMEX>. IQ4 will only be occupied when
        the calmodulin concentration is very high. When linearly
        arranged in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Myo1c</TIMEX> molecule, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> calmodulin
        (most likely that bound to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">IQ2</NUMEX>) is bound less tightly,
        probably due to steric constraints. Upon binding Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+,
        calmodulin bound to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IQ2</NUMEX> dissociates; that bound to IQ1
        either dissociates or changes its conformation sufficiently
        that chemomechanical coupling cannot ensue.

          Alexa-calmodulin had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> dye moieties per calmodulin
          molecule; the modified <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> were likely <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Lys-75</ENAMEX> and

          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> ] . After incubation for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 hours</TIMEX> at room
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">temperature</ENAMEX>, we transferred <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> Î¼l of the solution to
          another <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX>-well plate and measured fluorescence
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">excitation 485</ENAMEX> nm; emission, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">520</NUMEX> nm) using a BMG
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Labtechnologies Fluorostar</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">403</ENAMEX> microplate fluorometer
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Durham</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NC</ENAMEX>). Under the assay conditions, the
          inner-filter effect (absorption of excitation or emission
          photons by the sample) was negligible. From this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">measurement</ENAMEX>, we calculated the amount of calmodulin bound
          to the conjugated peptides. In some experiments, we also
          included <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> Î¼M unconjugated IQ peptide; in that
          case, we carried out duplicate control reactions in
          underivatized <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX>-well plates to correct for fluorescence
          quenching exerted by IQ peptides.
        
        
          Peptide - calmodulin interaction by fluorescence
          quench
          We used empirically observed changes in the
          fluorescence intensity of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alexa-calmodulin</ENAMEX>, large in
          magnitude, to measure binding of IQ peptides to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">calmodulin</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peptides</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50-500</NUMEX> nM Alexa-calmodulin were
          mixed in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX>- or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">384</NUMEX>-well microtiter plates with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">150</NUMEX> mM
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KCl</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> mM MgCl 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 , 100 Î¼M EGTA</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">25 Î</NUMEX>¼M CaCl 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/ml bovine serum albumin,
          and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15 mM HEPES</TIMEX> at pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.5</NUMEX>; in some experiments we added
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">50-75 Î</TIMEX>¼M bovine-brain calmodulin. Total volume varied
          from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î¼l</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">384</NUMEX>-well plates) to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100 Î¼l</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX>-well plates).
          After <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1-2 hours</TIMEX> at room temperature, fluorescence was
          read directly.
          When IQ peptides bound to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alexa-calmodulin</ENAMEX>, the
          fluorescence intensity was reduced as the quantum yield
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">decreased</ENAMEX> (fluorescence quenching). We assumed that two
          fluorescent <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> were present, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alexa-calmodulin</ENAMEX> and IQ
          peptide-bound <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alexa-calmodulin</ENAMEX>, and that the fluorescence
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">intensity</ENAMEX> ( 
          I ) was a linear combination of the
          fluorescence of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>:
          
          I = 
          f 
          CaM 
          I 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CaM</ENAMEX> + 
          f 
          CaM-IQ 
          I 
          CaM-IQ (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>)
          where 
          f 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CaM</ENAMEX> and 
          f 
          CaM-IQ are the mole fractions of the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> components and 
          I 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CaM</ENAMEX> and 
          I 
          CaM-IQ are their fluorescence
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intensities</ENAMEX>. Because the quantum yield of
          Alexa-calmodulin is reduced when IQ peptides bind, 
          I 
          CaM-IQ < 
          I 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CaM</ENAMEX> . The fraction of peptide bound
          is:
          
          To calculate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          d , we fit the data with a
          bimolecular-binding isotherm:
          
          where [IQ] was the free IQ-peptide concentration
          added. Because we used concentrations of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alexa</ENAMEX>-calmodulin
          in our experiments that were much less than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          d , we approximated [IQ] using the
          total IQ peptide concentration.
          In other cases, however, the binding data were fit
          better with a modified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hill</ENAMEX> equation:
          
          where 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">h</ENAMEX> is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hill</ENAMEX> coefficient. A value
          for 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">h</ENAMEX> greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> suggests the
          fluorescence change arose from a more complex equilibrium
          than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">just one</NUMEX> peptide binding per calmodulin.
          To carry out stoichiometric-titration experiments
          (calmodulin concentration greater than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          d ), we used a low concentration of
          Alexa-calmodulin as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> and added an excess of
          unlabeled calmodulin. For simplicity in analysis, we
          assumed that Alexa-calmodulin behaved identically to
          calmodulin, and thus this calmodulin mixture was
          equivalent to a decrease in specific activity
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">fluorescence quench</NUMEX>) of calmodulin. We then solved the
          bimolecular-binding isotherm to enable us to plot the
          total ligand concentration ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> ) added versus fluorescence
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">intensity</ENAMEX> ( 
          I ). The concentration of peptide
          bound ( 
          B ) was:
          
          B = 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">CaM</ENAMEX>] 
          f 
          CaM-IQ (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>)
          where 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> is the number of binding sites
          per calmodulin and [<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">CaM</ENAMEX>] is the fixed concentration of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">calmodulin</ENAMEX>. The free concentration of IQ peptide ( 
          F ) was 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> - 
          B . We substituted the expression
          for 
          B in equations (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>)
          into:
          
          Note that 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">CaM</ENAMEX>] is the maximum amount of IQ
          peptide that can bind (B 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">max</ENAMEX> ). We then solved equation (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6</ENAMEX>) for
          fluorescence intensity using <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Mathematica 4.0</NUMEX> (Wolfram
          Research, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Champaign, IL</ENAMEX>):
          
          For 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, the only free parameters
          were <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          d and 
          I 
          CaM-IQ . We were forced to include 
          I 
          CaM-IQ as one of the fit parameters;
          the limited solubility of IQ peptides in the assay
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solution</ENAMEX> prevented us from using very high peptide
          concentrations that would independently establish its
          value by producing a plateau in the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> vs. 
          I plot. We then used the value of 
          I 
          CaM-IQ determined from the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> fit and refit the data for 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          d as the only free parameter. To judge
          the stoichiometry, we compared by eye the effectiveness
          of the fit under the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> conditions.

          purified, and characterized using standard techniques [

          using methods described previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX> ] .

          Sedimentation coefficients of full-length and

          Determination of molecular mass
          We used the modified Svedberg equation for
          molecular-mass determination:
          
          where 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> = molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mass</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Î·</ENAMEX> = viscosity
          of the medium, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N = Avogadro</ENAMEX>'s number, 
          a = <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stokes</ENAMEX> radius, 
          s = sedimentation coefficient, =
          partial specific volume, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Ï</ENAMEX> = density of the medium.
          Partial specific volume was calculated from the
          composition of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Myo1c</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T701-Myo1c</ENAMEX>, along with the
          appropriate number of calmodulins, by summing the partial
          specific volumes of each amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] . We used Î· =
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1.002 Ã 10 -2g</NUMEX> cm <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-1s -1and Ï</TIMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.998 g cm -3</NUMEX>.
          Errors in molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mass</ENAMEX> were propagated from standard
          deviations for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stokes</ENAMEX> radius and sedimentation
          coefficient measurements. To calculate error in
          calmodulin stoichiometry, we used the conservative
          assumption that all error in the molecular-mass
          measurement was due to variability in the number of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">calmodulins</ENAMEX>.
          The frictional ratio was determined from:
          
          where 
          f is the frictional coefficient of
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Myo1c</NUMEX>-calmodulin <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> and 
          f 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">0</ENAMEX> is the frictional coefficient of a
          sphere of equal volume. Accordingly, the frictional ratio
          of a globular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> will be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>; that of an elongated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> will be ><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>.
        
        
          Stoichiometry determination by gel scanning
          T701<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-Myo1c</ENAMEX> and bovine-brain calmodulin were separated
          by sodium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dodecyl</ENAMEX> sulfate gel electrophoresis (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX>-PAGE)
          and stained with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Coomassie</ENAMEX> blue <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">R250</ENAMEX>. Gels were scanned
          with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">flatbed scanner</ENAMEX>; calmodulin was quantified using
          analysis of the resulting images with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIH Image</ENAMEX> version
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.62</NUMEX>. The concentration of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">T701-Myo1</NUMEX>c heavy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> was
          determined by measuring absorbance at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">280</NUMEX> nm, although
          the analysis was complicated by the uncertain calmodulin
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stoichiometry</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> ). To circumvent this problem, we
          solved several simultaneous equations for 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> . The molar extinction
          coefficient of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T701-Myo1c/</ENAMEX>calmodulin <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> (Îµ 
          T701-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">CaM</ENAMEX> ) is given by:
          Îµ 
          T701-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">CaM</ENAMEX> = Îµ 
          T701 + 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> Â·Îµ 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CaM</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10</NUMEX>)
          where Îµ 
          T701 is the extinction coefficient of
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">T701-Myo1</NUMEX>c heavy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> alone (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">57,990</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M -1cm -1</ENAMEX>), Îµ 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CaM</ENAMEX> is the extinction coefficient of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">calmodulin</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2560</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M -1cm -1</ENAMEX>), and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> is the calmodulin:T701
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stoichiometry</ENAMEX>. The concentration of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T701-Myo1</ENAMEX>c heavy
          chain is given by:
          
          where <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">A280</ENAMEX> is the absorbance of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">280</NUMEX> nm
          for a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> cm pathlength. Finally,
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p Â·</ENAMEX>[T701 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HC</ENAMEX> ] = [<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">CaM</ENAMEX>] (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">12</NUMEX>)
          where [<ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">CaM</ENAMEX>] is the calmodulin concentration determined
          by gel scanning. Solving for 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> :
          
        
        
          Other methods
          We measured the free Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+concentrations in our
          solutions using spectrofluorometry with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Calcium Green</ENAMEX>-2
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Molecular Probes</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX>-PAGE was carried out with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">18%</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">acrylamide Criterion</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">gels</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bio-Rad Laboratories</ENAMEX>;
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hercules</ENAMEX>, CA); gels were stained with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Coomassie</ENAMEX> blue
          R250.
