        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Artemisia L.</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asteraceae</ENAMEX>), as broadly
        conceived by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Linnaeus</ENAMEX>, is the largest genus in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tribe</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anthemideae</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3</NUMEX> ] and one of the largest in the family
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . It is widespread in mid- to high-latitudes, and
        shrubby species dominate most cold and many warm deserts in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Northern Hemisphere</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13</NUMEX> ] . Because
        of the abundance of wind-dispersed 
        Artemisia <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pollen</ENAMEX> in the geological
        column, it is used as an indicator of steppe climates [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>
        ] . Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> are foraged by ungulates, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rodents</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX>,
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 15 16 17 18 19</NUMEX> ] , despite the production
        of sesquiterpenes that afford a bitter taste to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">herbage</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">woody species</ENAMEX> increase dramatically under
        grazing pressure, thereby excluding desirable forage [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21</NUMEX> ] . Many 
        Artemisia <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> are a major cause
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">allergies</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . All 
        Artemisia species produce aromatic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oils</ENAMEX>, and several are culinary herbs or used as flavorings,
        hallucinogens, vermifuges, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pharmaceuticals</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 24 25</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX> ] , and some are toxic [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . 
        Artemisia annua (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> wormwood) and
        
        A. mexicana produce antimalarial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28 29 30</NUMEX> ] , and artemisinin (from 
        A. annua ) appears to selectively
        kill human breast cancer cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] .
        Despite the well-known importance of 
        Artemisia , there is no consensus on
        taxonomic relationships, which have traditionally been
        inferred on the basis of floral and capitular morphology.
        In 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Artemisia s.l .</ENAMEX>, the typical limb of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Anthemideae</ENAMEX>-type ray florets are reduced to a
        membranous vestige, giving the impression that the small
        capitula are composed only of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disk florets</ENAMEX>, referred to as
        disciform capitula (inflorescence) by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bremer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Humphries</ENAMEX>
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . In other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the genus, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">ray flowers</ENAMEX> are
        absent, thus the capitulum is composed only of disk
        florets, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">i.e .</ENAMEX>, discoid. In addition, plants
        with discoid capitula are considered homogamous since all
        florets are of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> sexual form (perfect<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">-bisexual</NUMEX> disk
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">florets</ENAMEX>), and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> with disciform capitula are considered
        heterogamous with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> or more sexual forms ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.e.</ENAMEX>, pistillate rays and perfect
        disks, or pistillate rays and staminate disks).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Taxonomic</ENAMEX> treatments for 
        Artemisia over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past 50 years</TIMEX>
        range from maintaining a single, large genus of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 500</NUMEX>
        species [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32 33 34 35 36 37</NUMEX> ] to the recognition of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> to
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> genera from within its taxonomic boundaries [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 38 39</NUMEX>
        ] . 
        Artemisia of antiquity was divided
        into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> genera ( 
        Artemisia, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Absinthium</ENAMEX>, and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Abrotanum</ENAMEX> ) by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tournefort</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> ] .
        However, the concept of a more inclusive genus was
        resurrected by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Linnaeus</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ] , hereinafter, referred to
        as 
        Artemisia s.l . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Besser</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ] and de
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Candolle</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX> ] recognized <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> sections within 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Artemisia s.l.</ENAMEX> primarily based on the
        presence or absence of ray florets and the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">fertility/sterility</ENAMEX> of disk florets: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abrotanum Besser</ENAMEX> ( 
        Artemisia of later <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX>) - ray
        florets pistillate and fertile; disk florets perfect and
        fertile; receptacle glabrous; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Absinthium</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mill</ENAMEX>.) <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DC - ray</ENAMEX> florets
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pistillate</ENAMEX> and fertile; disk florets perfect and fertile;
        receptacle hairy; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seriphidium</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Besser</ENAMEX>) Besser - ray
        florets absent; disk florets perfect and fertile;
        receptacle glabrous; and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) 
        Dracunculus Besser - ray florets
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pistillate</ENAMEX> and fertile; disk florets functionally
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">staminate</ENAMEX>; receptacle glabrous.
        The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> phylogenetic treatment [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> ] recognized four
        sections within a broadly defined 
        Artemisia s.l . with sect. 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Artemisia</ENAMEX> proposed as the progenitor
        to sect. 
        Absinthium , 
        Dracunculus , and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seriphidium</ENAMEX> . This phylogeny was
        based on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> hypothesized evolutionary trends: loss of
        fertility in the disk florets and loss of ray florets.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sect</ENAMEX>. 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Artemisia</ENAMEX> and 
        Absinthium were later united [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX> ]
        and all sections were raised to the level of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">subgenus</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47</NUMEX> ] , 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.e.</ENAMEX> , subg. 
        Artemisia, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dracunculus</ENAMEX> , and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seriphidium</ENAMEX> . In addition, a number
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21 34 35 47 48</NUMEX> ] considered the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">woody</ENAMEX> sagebrushes to have an independent origin from the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">woody Asian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> (subg. 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seriphidium</ENAMEX> ), and recognized sect. 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tridentatae</ENAMEX> .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Poljakov</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] and others [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] segregated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">subg</ENAMEX>. 
        Seriphidium as a distinct genus along
        with several small genera from within the boundaries of 
        Artemisia s.l . The more recent,
        major classifications [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2 39 49 50</ENAMEX> ] have agreed with the
        segregation of 
        Seriphidium on the basis of
        discoid-homogamous capitula and recognized the smaller
        segregate genera as well. Ling [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39 51 52</NUMEX> ] , for instance,
        considered 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Artemisia s.s.</ENAMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seriphidium</ENAMEX> to be distinct and sister
        to each other, and with the small segregate and allied
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genera</ENAMEX> in turn <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> to them [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53</TIMEX> ] . In their landmark
        monograph of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tribe Anthemideae, Bremer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Humphries</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ]
        placed 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Artemisia</ENAMEX> and its allied genera in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Subtribe Artemisiinae</ENAMEX>. In contrast to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Ling</ENAMEX>'s hypothesis [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">53</NUMEX> ] regarding sister <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> relationships between 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Artemisia s.s.</ENAMEX> and 
        Seriphidium , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bremer</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Humphries</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">morphologically</ENAMEX> based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cladogram</ENAMEX> placed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
        small genera ( 
        Neopallasia, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Turaniphytum, Mausolea</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Picrothamnus</ENAMEX> ; with a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>) as
        closest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sisters</ENAMEX> ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">i.e ., segregates</ENAMEX>) of 
        Artemisia s.s . (the 
        Artemisia -clade 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sensu Bremer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Humphries</ENAMEX>), whereas 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seriphidium</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> small genera ( 
        Kaschgaria, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Crossostephium</ENAMEX> ; 3
        species total) were placed outside the 
        Artemisia -clade as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">allies</ENAMEX> to 
        Artemisia s.s . In addition, 
        Sphaeromeria, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Filifolium</ENAMEX>,
        Ajaniopsis , and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stilnolepis</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> total) were
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> to this clade of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> genera that included 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Artemisia s.s.</ENAMEX> and its segregates and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">allies</ENAMEX>. Further, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Ling and Ling</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">54</TIMEX> ] recognized 
        Elachanthemum as distinct from 
        Stilnolepis , 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">i.e .</ENAMEX>, as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> monotypic genera.
        Altogether these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12-13</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">genera</ENAMEX> comprise the 
        Artemisia -group 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sensu Bremer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Humphries</ENAMEX>.
        According to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bremer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Humphries</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] , the 
        Artemisia -<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> is monophyletic and
        defined by heterogamous-disciform capitula (disk florets
        usually bisexual and fertile, ray florets pistillate) or
        homogamous-discoid capitula (disk florets usually bisexual
        and fertile, ray florets absent), <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pollen</ENAMEX> with short or no
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">spines</ENAMEX> (associated with anemophily), and thick-walled
        cypselas devoid of ribs (sometimes faint ribs are present
        in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sphaeromeria</ENAMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crossostephium</ENAMEX> ). All of the 
        Artemisia -<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> genera contain
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> that have been variously placed within the
        taxonomic boundaries of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Artemisia s.l.</ENAMEX> with the exceptions of
        
        Sphaeromeria, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Neopallasia</ENAMEX>,
        Turaniphytum , and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mausolea</ENAMEX>. Nonetheless, these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
        genera are always considered closely related to it [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 33</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37 38 55</NUMEX> ] . 
        Artemisia s.s . and 
        Seriphidium are composed of
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">380</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">140</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, respectively, and are
        geographically widespread. Their species occur
        predominantly throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> and temperate <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX>, as well
        as in western <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North America</ENAMEX>. 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sphaeromeria</ENAMEX> and 
        Picrothamnus are endemic to western
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North America</ENAMEX>, whereas all remaining <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Artemisiinae</ENAMEX> genera
        occur in eastern, southwestern, or central <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX>.
        Several biological factors may account for the
        disagreement and wide range of interpretation in relation
        to generic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">circumscription</ENAMEX> and subgeneric boundaries in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Artemisia</ENAMEX> and its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">allies</ENAMEX>, including
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rapid</ENAMEX> and recent diversification, reduction in floral
        features (associated with anemophily) with the concomitant
        loss of potentially useful taxonomic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX>, multiple
        origins of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">woodiness</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34 35 56</NUMEX> ] , and chromosomal
        evolution and hybridization [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">57 58 59 60</NUMEX> ] . In addition,
        most studies have focused on a limited geographic region,
        rather than studying the taxon worldwide.
        The primary objective of this study is to construct a
        molecular phylogeny of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Subtribe Artemisiinae</ENAMEX>, including 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Artemisia</ENAMEX> and its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">allies</ENAMEX>, employing
        the internal transcribed spacers (ITS) of nuclear ribosomal
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">nr</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>. The goals are (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) to test the monophyly of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Subtribe Artemisiinae</ENAMEX> and the 
        Artemisia -<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) determine the
        phylogenetic placements of the segregate and allied genera
        in relation to 
        Artemisia s.s .; and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) evaluate the
        patterns of diversification and test biogeographic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypotheses</ENAMEX> and evolutionary trends in capitular and floral
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">morphology</ENAMEX> in the 
        Artemisia -group [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">49 50</NUMEX> ] . The ITS
        have been demonstrated to be appropriate for examining
        generic relationships in many <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> including the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asteraceae</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">61</TIMEX> ] , for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tribe Anthemideae</ENAMEX> specifically [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">62</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">63</NUMEX> ] and within 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Artemisia</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34 36</NUMEX> ] .
      
      
        Results
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> products of the ITS were resolved as single
        bands on <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.0%</NUMEX> agarose gels. Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">520</NUMEX> aligned nucleotide
        positions for both spacers combined (excluding gaps
        required for alignment), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">213</NUMEX> were phylogenetically
        informative. Sequence divergence (uncorrected "p") is <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4-6%</ENAMEX>
        among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the 
        Artemisia -clade, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> among members
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Subtribe Artemisiinae</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">17%</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between</TIMEX> Subtribe
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Artemisiinae</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">outgroup species</ENAMEX> from other
        Anthemideae subtribes.
        Resulting phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> obtained by maximum
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">parsimony</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">MP</ENAMEX>), maximum likelihood (ML), and Bayesian
        analyses were congruent in topology. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">All three</NUMEX> analyses
        resolved <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> major clades for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Subtribe Artemisiinae</ENAMEX>, with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">MP</ENAMEX> the least resolved and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ML</ENAMEX> the most highly resolved. The
        topologies differed in the placement of 
        Stilnolepis , which was placed
        outside of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Subtribe Artemisiinae</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">MP</ENAMEX> and at the base of
        the subtribe by both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ML</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bayes</ENAMEX>. Otherwise, the tree
        topologies differed only in their ability to resolve
        relationships within the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> major clades (numbered <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2,</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
        Using <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">MP</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> analyses (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> replicates with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBR</ENAMEX> branch

        resulted in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30,000</NUMEX> equally parsimonious <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1056</TIMEX> steps
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.339</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RI</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.707</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RC</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.240</NUMEX>). The resulting
        consensus <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> from each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">MP</ENAMEX> analysis are identical in
        topology, with little resolution achieved (trees not
        shown). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> major clades of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Subtribe Artemisiinae</ENAMEX> were
        resolved and include: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) species of all

        Discussion
        
          Monophyly of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Subtribe Artemisiinae</ENAMEX> and the
          Artemisia-group
          The ITS data provide weak support for the monophyly of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Subtribe Artemisiinae</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>), i.e., <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">67%</NUMEX> posterior
          probability as estimated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MrBayes</ENAMEX> and unsupported as
          measured by parsimony bootstrap analysis (<<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX>). 
          ndh F sequence data also failed to
          resolve or support the monophyly of Subtribe Artemisiinae
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">64</TIMEX> ] . In the ITS phylogeny, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> genus appears to
          disrupt its monophyly, 
          Stilnolepis , which occupies the
          basal-most position of the ingroup. However, the next
          node up is supported at a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">94%</NUMEX> posterior probability,
          indicating that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Subtribe Artemisiinae</ENAMEX> is likely
          monophyletic, with the possible exception of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stilnolepis</ENAMEX> .
          The ITS phylogeny (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) resolved <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> major clades
          within <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Subtribe Artemisiinae</ENAMEX> that correspond to the
          following: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) all subgenera of

          Dracunculus, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>)

          have segregate genera embedded within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each</TIMEX> (indicated in

          posterior probabilities, respectively, with the third
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clade</ENAMEX> also supported by a bootstrap value of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99%</NUMEX>. The 
          Artemisia -group 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sensu Bremer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Humphries</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] is
          not monophyletic because <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> segregate genera 
          Elachanthemum, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Stilnolepis</ENAMEX> , and 
          Kaschgaria are excluded from this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clade</ENAMEX>. Additionally, 
          Artemisia s.l . is monophyletic
          only with the inclusion of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> segregate genera: 
          Seriphidium, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sphaeromeria, Neopallasia</ENAMEX>,
          Crossostephium , and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Filifolium</ENAMEX> . Additionally, this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clade</ENAMEX> is only weakly supported with a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">63%</NUMEX> posterior
          probability and bootstrap support <<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX>.
        
        
          Placement of segregate and allied genera
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> segregate and allied genera that we
          examined were placed outside of the

          Stilnolepis, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Elachanthemum</ENAMEX>, and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kaschgaria</ENAMEX> ), whereas the remaining
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> were placed within it (including 
          Seriphidium, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sphaeromeria, Neopallasia</ENAMEX>,
          Crossostephium , and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Filifolium</ENAMEX> ). However many of these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">placements</ENAMEX> are among the most weakly supported branches
          of the resulting phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
          
          Stilnolepis, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Elachanthemum</ENAMEX>, and 
          Kaschgaria are excluded from the
          clade of the 
          Artemisia -<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, and are, in part,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> to all remaining <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Artemisiinae</ENAMEX> genera in the ITS
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phylogeny</ENAMEX>. 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stilnolepis</ENAMEX> and 
          Elachanthemum are monotypic genera
          that occur in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Central Asia</ENAMEX>, that are often treated as a
          single genus, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stilnolepis</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . However, our
          ITS phylogeny supports <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Ling</ENAMEX>'s treatment of them as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          distinct genera [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">54</TIMEX> ] . Neither genus appears to be a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of 
          Artemisia s.l . or the 
          Artemisia -<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. Both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genera</ENAMEX> are
          discoid with corymbose capitula, but whether either genus
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">possesses spineless pollen</ENAMEX> (a synapomorphy for the 
          Artemisia -<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>) or is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">wind-pollinated</ENAMEX> has not yet been determined [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2 37</ENAMEX> ] . 
          Kaschgaria, a genus of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> species
          from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> and central <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX>, is also placed outside of
          the 
          Artemisia -<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, but clearly
          within <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Subtribe Artemisiinae</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">94%</NUMEX> probability) in the ITS
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phylogeny</ENAMEX>. 
          Kaschgaria was removed by Poljakov
          from 
          Artemisia s.l . on the basis of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">stellate corolla</ENAMEX> hairs, and was considered more closely
          related to 
          Seriphidium than 
          Artemisia s.<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">s .</ENAMEX>, even though it is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">disciform</ENAMEX> rather than discoid [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kaschgaria</ENAMEX> possesses spineless
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pollen</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2 37</ENAMEX> ] . Therefore, placement of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kaschgaria</ENAMEX> and 
          Elachanthemum outside of the 
          Artemisia -<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> is intriguing
          because if these placements remain robust,
          wind-pollination may have arisen more than once in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tribe</ENAMEX>, or insect-pollination may be secondarily derived
          within <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Subtribe Artemisiinae</ENAMEX> in the radiate genera (clade
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> of the small allied/segregate genera are embedded
          within the clade of the

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seriphidium</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Filifolium</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> to species of

          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Korea</ENAMEX>, and was previously considered a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> of subg. 
          Dracunculus on the basis of sterile

          Dracunculus as 
          Oligosporus with the sterility of
          the central florets as the defining synapomorphy that
          unites these <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2b). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bremer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Humphries</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
          ] noted that 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mausolea</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Picrothamnus</ENAMEX> share this trait, and
          suggested that 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oligosporus</ENAMEX> should be resurrected
          and defined to include these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> segregate genera. 
          Mausolea was segregated by Poljakov
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Artemisia s.l.</ENAMEX> by marginal <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX>
          that lack corollas. 
          Picrothamnus was established by

          and according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bremer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Humphries</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] is

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mausolea</ENAMEX> or 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Picrothamnus</ENAMEX> .
          Monotypic 
          Crossostephium was treated as a

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ] . It is distinct from 
          Artemisia by the presence of a

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rydberg</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX> ] on the basis of deeply-ribbed cypselas. 
          Crossostephium occurs in the

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> that occur in central <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX>, including southern
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Siberia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mongolia</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . It was segregated
          from 
          Artemisia by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Poljakov</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">66</TIMEX> ] on the
          basis of several autapomorphies, including pectinate
          leaves, central-sterile florets at the apex of the
          capitulum, ovoid-lanceolate anther appendages, and a
          rosette-shaped arrangement of cypselas on the receptacle.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Poljakov</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">66</TIMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bremer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Humphries</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] contended
          that 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Neopallasia</ENAMEX> is closely related to 
          Artemisia subg. 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drancunculus</ENAMEX> . However, the ITS
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> place 
          Neopallasia <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asian</ENAMEX> species
          of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seriphidium</ENAMEX> and some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of 
          Artemisia subg. 
          Artemisia , close to 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crossostephium</ENAMEX> . This placement is
          moderately supported at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">87%</NUMEX> probability.
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sphaeromeria</ENAMEX> is considered closely
          related to 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Artemisia s.l.</ENAMEX> , although it was
          once treated as a section of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tanacetum</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">55</TIMEX> ] . It is a small
          genus of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">western North American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, and has no
          autapomorphies that distinguish it from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Artemisia s.l. Bremer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Humphries</ENAMEX>
          [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] suggested that it might be more closely related to 
          Kaschgaria , a genus composed of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> that occur in central <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX>. They
          are similar in habit and have similar inflorescences that
          are slightly elongated. However, in the ITS phylogeny
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>), 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sphaeromeria</ENAMEX> is distant to 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kaschgaria</ENAMEX>. Rather its placement is
          unsupported within a 
          Seriphidium subclade that contains
          several anomalous <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">North American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, some of which
          have been placed in sect. 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tridentatae</ENAMEX> . However, because of
          the lack of support for placement of 
          Sphaeromeria , we are hesitant to
          suggest that it be submerged in 
          Artemisia s.l . without further
          study. However, it does not appear closely related to 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kaschgaria</ENAMEX> .
          
          Seriphidium palmeri is an anomalous
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> that was once treated as segregate genus 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Artemisiastrum</ENAMEX> . The ITS phylogeny
          places it among New World subg. 
          Artemisia <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, in agreement
          with previous studies [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34 35</NUMEX> ] and not in agreement with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bremer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Humphries</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] who place it near 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seriphidium</ENAMEX> sect. 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tridentatae</ENAMEX> . This is a strongly
          supported relationship at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> bootstrap and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99%</NUMEX>
          probability. Thus 
          Artemisiatrum , should not be
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">resurrected</ENAMEX>, with 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> palmeri more closely related to
          the New World species of 
          Artemisia subg. 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Artemisia</ENAMEX> rather than with the New
          World 
          Seriphidium <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> that comprise
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sect</ENAMEX>. 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tridentatae</ENAMEX>. 
        
        
          Infrageneric classification of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Artemisia</ENAMEX> s.l
          While this study is incomplete with regards to
          subgeneric boundaries because only a limited number of 
          Artemisia <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> was sampled from
          this large genus, some preliminary conclusions can still
          be made on emerging patterns of the derived phylogeny. 
          Artemisia subg. 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Artemisia</ENAMEX> is not supported as
          monophyletic, with its <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> placed in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> different
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clades</ENAMEX> in the ITS tree (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). It is apparently defined
          taxonomically on the basis of plesiomorphies
          (heterogamous, disciform capitula with perfect/fertile
          disk florets and pistillate ray florets), and needs to be
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">re</ENAMEX>-circumscribed. 
          Artemisia subg. 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Absinthium</ENAMEX> is monophyletic (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">96%</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">probability</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">76%</NUMEX> bootstrap) in the ITS phylogeny and
          differs from all other subgenera by a hairy receptacle.
          However it is embedded within a clade of species of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Old</ENAMEX>
          World subg. 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Artemisia</ENAMEX> . Thus, we agree with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gray</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX> ] that the species of subg. 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Absinthium</ENAMEX> should be merged into
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subg</ENAMEX>. 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Artemisia</ENAMEX>. Similarly, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Old World</ENAMEX> 
          Seriphidium <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> are
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">monophyletic</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">96%</NUMEX> probability), but should also be
          subsumed within 
          Artemisia subg. 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Artemisia</ENAMEX> .
          Previously, the origin of the 
          Tridentatae was unresolved with
          competing hypotheses from the New World 
          Artemisia <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> vs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Old World</ENAMEX> 
          Seriphidium species being equivocal
          [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34 35</NUMEX> ] . The current ITS phylogeny suggests that the
          closest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Tridentatae</ENAMEX> lie among the New World
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">species of</ENAMEX> 
          Artemisia , in agreement with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McArthur</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Plummer</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] , perhaps sharing a common
          ancestry with 
          A. filifolia and 
          A. californica , in addition to 
          Sphaeromeria , although monophyly
          for this subclade is unsupported by the ITS data. 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seriphidium</ENAMEX> sect. 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tridentatae</ENAMEX> does not share a most
          recent common ancestor with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Old World</ENAMEX> 
          Seriphidium <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, and it should
          not be treated with the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Old World woody artemisias</ENAMEX>, as we
          and others have previously suggested [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34 35 36</NUMEX> ] .
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seriphidium</ENAMEX> sect. 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tridentatae</ENAMEX> is characterized by
          discoid-homogamous capitula, with the exception of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. bigelowii</ENAMEX> , which has occasional
          heterogamous-disciform capitula of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> pistillate ray
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">floret</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> perfect disk florets - a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> that
          was previously considered a plesiomorphy or secondary
          reversal in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> bigelowii [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . Based on ITS
          and chloroplast phylogenies of sect. 
          Tridentatae , we previously
          concluded [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34 35</NUMEX> ] that 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. bigelowii</ENAMEX> was perhaps misplaced
          and should be excluded from the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tridentatae</ENAMEX> . In addition, we
          explained [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34 35</NUMEX> ] an unexpected relationship between it
          and 
          A. filfifolia as possible
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridization</ENAMEX> and introgression involving bidirectional
          gene flow rather than recent common ancestry because
          heterogamous-disciform 
          A. bigelowii differs from
          heterogamous-disciform 
          A. filifolia by perfect disk
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">florets</ENAMEX> instead of female-sterile disk florets. 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sphaeromeria</ENAMEX> also has
          heterogamous-disciform capitula with pistillate ray and
          perfect disk florets, as does heterogamous-disciform 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. bigelowii</ENAMEX> , suggesting that it
          is indeed a plesiomorphy. The occasional appearance of
          disciform capitula in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. bigelowii</ENAMEX> might be explained by
          introgression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> or alleles from 
          A. filfolia that control ray
          expression, a phenomenon observed in discoid 
          Senecio squallidus and radiate 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> vulgaris in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">67</TIMEX> ] .
          While this is speculative, it is consistent with
          hypotheses that hybridization and introgression are
          widespread in sect. 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tridentatae</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">68</TIMEX> ] , and may
          explain occasional heterogamous disciform capitula in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> bigelowii [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34 35</NUMEX> ] . However,
          there may be many genetic and developmental mechanisms
          that affect ray formation and control floret fertility [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">69 70</NUMEX> ] .
          Artemisia subg. 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drancunculus</ENAMEX> is monophyletic and is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> to all remaining 
          Artemisia <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>. It, perhaps
          combined with 
          Filifolium, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mausolea</ENAMEX>, and
          Picrothamnus, could be treated as a separate genus, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oligosporus</ENAMEX> (following <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cassini</ENAMEX>), or
          as one of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> subgenera of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Artemisia</ENAMEX> . In the latter case, all
          remaining species of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Artemisia</ENAMEX> (including subg. 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Absinthium</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Artemisia</ENAMEX> ) and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seriphidium</ENAMEX> (including sect. 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tridentatae</ENAMEX>) would collectively
          form a much expanded subg. 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Artemisia</ENAMEX>. Thus, 
          Artemisia s.l . should either be
          treated as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> subgenera, i.e., a largely expanded subg. 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Artemisia</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clade</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dracunculus</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clade</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>), or
          as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> distinct genera, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Artemisia</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oligosporus</ENAMEX> . Both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clades</ENAMEX> are
          moderately supported at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">77 and 74%</NUMEX> probabilities, and
          include several segregate genera as well. Therefore, we
          favor retaining the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Linnean</ENAMEX> concept of the genus with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subg</ENAMEX>. 
          Dracunculus conserved, and the
          numerous segregate genera eventually being subsumed
          within

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sister group</ENAMEX> relationships of Subtribe Artemisiinae
          were unresolved on the basis of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">morphology</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] .
          However an ITS phylogeny of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Francisco</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ortega</ENAMEX> et al. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">62</NUMEX>

          An ITS phylogeny of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Subtribe Leucantheminae</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">71</TIMEX> ] also
          excluded these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> genera from that subtribe, which is

          this study resulted in the recognition of the importance
          of biogeography in the evolution of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tribe</ENAMEX> as a whole,

          Artemisia -<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bremer</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Humphries</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cladogram</ENAMEX>, contain some species that were
          once classified as 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Artemisia s.l.</ENAMEX> since they are also
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">disciform</ENAMEX>. However, these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genera</ENAMEX> were removed from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Artemisia s.l .</ENAMEX>, and on the basis
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spiny pollen</ENAMEX> have been considered transitional between
          the 
          Artemisia -<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> radiate
          genera: 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tridactylina Arctanthemum</ENAMEX>,
          Brachanthemum, and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dendranthema</ENAMEX> . Our ITS phylogeny
          places disciform 
          Ajania <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> to radiate 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Arctanthemum</ENAMEX> derived from within
          the 
          Arctanthemum-Dendranthema clade,
          rather than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> to the 
          Artemisia -<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. Thus, disciform 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ajania</ENAMEX> does not appear to be
          intermediate between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">radiate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Artemisiinae</ENAMEX> and disciform 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Artemisia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">allies</ENAMEX>. Furthermore,
          the tentative placement of disciform 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kaschgaria</ENAMEX> and discoid 
          Stilnolepis <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> to the entire
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">subtribe</ENAMEX> suggests that there may have been multiple
          origins for disciform, as well as discoid capitula.
        
        
          Biogeography
          A complex scenario for the origin and diversification
          of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Artemisia</ENAMEX> and 
          Seriphidium , and subsequent
          parallel evolution of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> genera in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Old</ENAMEX> and New
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Worlds</ENAMEX>, was proposed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ling</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39 49</NUMEX> ] . The putative
          common ancestor to both "sister <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">genera</ENAMEX>" was hypothesized
          to have existed in northern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX>, based on reported
          fossil <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pollen</ENAMEX> records that date the taxa to the early
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oligocene</ENAMEX> or lower <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eocene</ENAMEX> of the lower <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tertiary</ENAMEX>, with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">speciation</ENAMEX> accompanied by migrations during the Tertiary
          and Quaternary periods - forced southward by the
          advancing polar ice sheets. Hypothesized migrations out
          of northern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX> purportedly occurred along <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> lines:
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) westward into <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, with gradual migration into
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North America</ENAMEX>, western <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asia Minor</ENAMEX>, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mediterranean</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) eastward into <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Siberia</ENAMEX> into
          western <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North America</ENAMEX>, and into eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>; and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>)
          further south into <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX> primarily during the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quaternary</ENAMEX>. 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seriphidium</ENAMEX> is clearly embedded as
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> distinct clades within 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Artemisia</ENAMEX> in the molecular
          phylogenies, making a sister <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> relationship
          unlikely.
          According to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Ling</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39 49</NUMEX> ] , a 'pro- 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Absinthium</ENAMEX> ' ancestor in northern
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asia</ENAMEX> gave rise to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of 
          Absinthium , which directly gave
          rise to 
          Abrotanum, which subsequently gave
          rise to 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seriphidium</ENAMEX> . An 
          Absinthium origin for 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seriphidium</ENAMEX> has also been proposed
          on the basis of flavonoid data [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">72</TIMEX> ] . The ITS data do
          not support a sister <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> relationship of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subg</ENAMEX>. 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Absinthium</ENAMEX> to the remainder of 
          Artemisia s.l . In contrast, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Absinthium</ENAMEX> is embedded within a
          derived clade composed of both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Old</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New World</ENAMEX> members
          of subg. 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Artemisia</ENAMEX> . A proposed secondary
          diversification occurred during the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Himalayan</ENAMEX> uplift in
          the late <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tertiary</ENAMEX>, and resulted in a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> of diversity
          that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> harbors 116 species of regional endemics of 
          Artemisia s.s . A more detailed
          examination of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Artemisia s.l.</ENAMEX> is necessary to more
          fully evaluate this hypothesis.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clements</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> ] proposed a sister group
          relationship of subg. 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Artemisia</ENAMEX> to remaining subgenera.
          This hypothesis is also not supported because subg. 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Artemisia</ENAMEX> is not monophyletic. In
          contrast, the ITS phylogeny supports an early divergence
          of subg. 
          Dracunculus from the remaining 
          Artemisia subgenera.
          It appears that the New World species of 
          Artemisia s.l . are paraphyletic
          and that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">North American</ENAMEX> lineages arose once with at
          least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> back migration to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Old World</ENAMEX> by some members
          of subg. 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Artemisia</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Absinthium</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). Alternatively,
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">North American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lineages</ENAMEX> may have arisen twice,
          independently. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Graham</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">73</TIMEX> ] suggested that the most
          convincing earliest fossil <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pollen</ENAMEX> records for 
          Artemisia are late <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oligocene</ENAMEX> from
          Central <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>. In all likelihood, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Subtribe Artemisiinae</ENAMEX>
          and 
          Artemisia s. l . originated in
          Eurasia sharing a relatively ancient common ancestry with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Asian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leucantheminae</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">South African</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">members</ENAMEX>
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Subtribe Matricariinae</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">64</TIMEX> ] .
        
      
      
        Conclusion
        The ITS data do not support the segregation of numerous
        small genera or 
        Seriphidium from within the
        boundaries of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Artemisia</ENAMEX> . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> major clades for 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Artemisia s.l.</ENAMEX> are supported and
        include subg. 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dracunculus</ENAMEX> and subg. 
        Artemisia , with the segregate genera
        and subgenera of 
        Artemisia embedded within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">subg</TIMEX>. 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Artemisia</ENAMEX> . Additionally, three
        segregate genera are placed outside of the 
        Artemisia -clade. For <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Subtribe</ENAMEX>
        Artemisiinae, the 
        Artemisia -<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sister</ENAMEX> to the radiate genera. Additional molecular markers
        are necessary to further resolve relationships within the
        Artemisiinae, before making taxonomic decisions to subsume
        all segregate genera within 
        Artemisia s.l .
      
      
        Methods
        ITS sequences were obtained for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">57</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> representing
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">11 genera</TIMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Subtribe Artemisiinae</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41</NUMEX> outgroup species
        from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">seven additional Anthemideae subtribes</NUMEX>. Voucher
        specimens were deposited in herbaria (see additional file
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Total genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> was isolated from fresh or silica-gel
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">dried leaves</ENAMEX> using the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">2X</NUMEX> CTAB procedure [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">74 75</NUMEX> ] . The
        ITS region was amplified using primers of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White et al.</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">76</NUMEX>
        ] , as previously described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] . For unpublished
        sequences, the spacers were sequenced on an ABI PRISM 310
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">®Genetic Analyzer</ENAMEX> using capillary sequencing and Big Dye
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Terminator Chemistry</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Applied Biosystems, Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Foster</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">City</ENAMEX>, CA). The sequence boundaries of the spacers were
        determined by comparison to published 
        Artemisia sequences [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] , and
        complete <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> were deposited in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">GenBank</ENAMEX> (see
        additional file <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). All ITS sequences were aligned using
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clustal W</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">77</TIMEX> ] , with manual gap adjustments made to
        improve the alignment (see additional file <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2,</ENAMEX>

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">MP analyses</ENAMEX> were performed using the software PAUP* <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.0</NUMEX>
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">78</TIMEX> ] , assuming unordered character <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> and equal
        character state weighting. Gaps were treated as missing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HEURISTICS</ENAMEX> search option was used, ignoring
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">invariant</ENAMEX> and uninformative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">characters</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Random</ENAMEX> addition of
        sequences for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> replicates with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TREE</ENAMEX>

        per replicate, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> replicates with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBR</ENAMEX> swapping on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> per replicate were performed using the following
        settings: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MULTREES</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STEEPEST DESCENT</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAXTREES</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30,000</NUMEX>,
        and accelerated transformation (ACCTRAN). Strict consensus
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> were constructed, and bootstrap values were
        calculated as measures of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> support [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">79</TIMEX> ] using the
        following bootstrap parameters: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> bootstrap replicates,
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5000</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">MAXTREES</ENAMEX> per replicate, random addition sequence, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBR</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STEEPEST DESCENT</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MULTREES</ENAMEX>. In addition, the
        Consistency Index (CI), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Retention</ENAMEX> Index (RI), and the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rescaled Consistency</ENAMEX> Index (RC) were calculated as measures
        of homoplasy in the data.
        An ML analysis was also conducted as a preferred
        alternative to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">MP</ENAMEX> since comparative studies have shown that
        in most situations <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">MP</ENAMEX> can fail to resolve an accurate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phylogeny</ENAMEX> and generally underestimates bootstrap support [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</NUMEX> ] . Model based analyses, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ML</ENAMEX>, estimate actual
        site changes from observed by taking into account various
        aspects of molecular evolution, such as multiple hits and
        among site rate heterogeneity. Simulation studies have
        shown that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ML</ENAMEX> is typically more accurate and robust than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">MP</ENAMEX>
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">81 82</NUMEX> ] . Thus an ML analysis of the data was conducted
        by employing an heuristic search in PAUP* using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TBR</ENAMEX> branch
        swapping on a starting tree based on neighbor joining,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACCTRAN</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STEEPEST DESCENT</ENAMEX> under the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TrN</ENAMEX>+<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> DNA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">substitution</ENAMEX> model [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">83</TIMEX> ] . This model was selected using a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hierarchical Likelihood Ratio Test</ENAMEX> (HLRT) in Modeltest
        version 3.06 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">84</TIMEX> ] .
        Because bootstrap analysis using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ML</ENAMEX> is not
        computationally feasible for large data sets [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">85</TIMEX> ] , we
        conducted a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Bayesian</ENAMEX> analysis as an alternative employing
        optimization parameters similar to the nucleotide
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">substitution</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> that we used for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ML</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">86 87</NUMEX> ] . The
        distinction between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ML</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bayesian</ENAMEX> inference is that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bayesian</ENAMEX> provides probabilities for hypotheses, not
        probabilities of data given a hypothesis [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">85 87 88</NUMEX> ] .
        Bayesian analysis uses <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Markov Chain Monte Carlo</ENAMEX> (MCMC)
        methods to approximate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">posterior</ENAMEX> probability distributions
        that are a direct estimation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> support because they
        are the true probabilities of the resulting clades under
        the assumed models, unlike bootstrap values [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">87 88</NUMEX> ] .
        Additionally, bootstrap values and posterior probabilities
        derived from Bayesian analyses for multiple data sets
        appear to be correlated [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">88</TIMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Bayesian</ENAMEX> analysis was
        conducted with the software MrBayes 2.0 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">89</TIMEX> ] . A GTR
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">substitution</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> rate frequencies was selected as
        the most similar model to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trn</ENAMEX>+<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> substitution model (the
        latter model is not available in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">MrBayes</ENAMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> MCMC chains
        were used with initial random starting <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>. The analysis
        was run for <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 × 10 6generations</NUMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> sampled every <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
        generations resulting in <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 × 10 5samples</NUMEX>. The analysis
        reached stationarity at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2500 generations</TIMEX>, and these burnin
        samples were excluded from the majority rule consensus tree
        of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">97,500</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX>, which was generated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAUP</ENAMEX>* to obtain
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bayesian</ENAMEX> posterior probabilities.
