        Quality of life can be improved by enhancing standards
        of medical treatment at all levels of the health care
        delivery system. Setting standards and assessing the
        quality of care through performance review should become
        part of everyday clinical practice [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . The study of
        prescribing patterns seeks to monitor, evaluate and suggest
        modifications in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">practitioners</ENAMEX>' prescribing habits so as to
        make medical care rational and cost effective.
        Information about <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibiotic</ENAMEX> use patterns is necessary
        for a constructive approach to problems that arise from the
        multiple antibiotics available [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . In developing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> the cost of health care is a matter of major
        concern [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . This is especially true for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nepal</ENAMEX>, a
        developing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Asia</ENAMEX>. Excessive and
        inappropriate use of antibiotics in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>, health care
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">facilities</ENAMEX> and the community contributes to the development
        of bacterial resistance. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> reports on antibiotic
        utilization at an institutional level include both
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross-sectional</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] and longitudinal studies [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5</NUMEX> ] of
        prescribing patterns.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATC</ENAMEX> (anatomic-therapeutic-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemical</ENAMEX>) classification
        assigns code letters and numbers to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7</NUMEX> ] . The
        defined <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> dose (DDD) concept was developed to overcome
        objections against traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> of drug consumption [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDD</ENAMEX> for a given <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> is established on the basis
        of an assumed average use per day of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> for its main
        indication in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDD</ENAMEX> will be assigned only for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> that already have an ATC code. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDD</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> of
        measurement and may not reflect the prescribed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> dose,
        however they provide a fixed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> of measurement
        independent of price and formulation and enable the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researcher</ENAMEX> to perform comparisons between population
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDD</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/100</ENAMEX> bed-days provides a rough estimate of
        consumption of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> in-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
        Information on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibiotic</ENAMEX> use patterns, the illnesses
        for which antibiotics are prescribed and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">DDD/100</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bed-days</ENAMEX> of commonly used antibiotics in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> in
        Western <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nepal</ENAMEX> are lacking. Hence the present study was
        carried out over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 months</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">01.04.02 to 30.06.02</NUMEX>) at the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manipal Teaching Hospital</ENAMEX>, a tertiary care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>
        attached to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manipal College of Medical Sciences</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pokhara</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nepal</ENAMEX>.
        The objectives of the study were to:
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) collect relevant demographic information and
        information on duration of hospitalization of patients
        admitted to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal Medicine</ENAMEX> ward and prescribed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antibiotics</ENAMEX> during the study.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) obtain information on the antibiotic prescribing
        pattern and the disease conditions for which antibiotics
        were prescribed.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) obtain information on the common organisms isolated
        during culture and sensitivity testing and their antibiotic
        sensitivity patterns.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) apply the ATC classification to the commonly used
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antibiotics</ENAMEX> and to calculate their <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DDDs/100</ENAMEX> bed-days.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>) calculate the mean Â± SD cost of antibiotics per
        prescription.
      
      
        Methods
        The study was carried out over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a three-month period</TIMEX> at
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manipal Teaching Hospital</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pokhara</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nepal</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX>
        admitted to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal Medicine</ENAMEX> ward who were prescribed
        antibiotics were included in the study and were identified
        manually. This may have the potential for bias and errors.
        Quantitative estimation of the bias has not been carried
        out in this study. Computerization of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medical Records</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Department</ENAMEX> is in progress and there is a proposal for
        storing the hospital records in a computerized format. This
        may help in reducing any potential bias.
        The age and sex of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, clinical diagnosis,
        duration of hospitalization, antibiotic information (name,
        dose and frequency) and the results of culture and
        sensitivity testing were entered into the patient indicator
        form (PIF) [see Additional file <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>]. The antibiotics
        prescribed for parenteral use and indications for their use
        were also analyzed separately. Antibiotics were used for:
        prophylaxis, bacteriologically proven infection (BPI) or
        non-bacteriologically proven infection (non-BPI). Details
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibiotic</ENAMEX> use in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPI</ENAMEX> were noted.

        The mean cost of antibiotics prescribed during the
        hospital stay and on discharge from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> was noted.
        The cost of antibiotics prescribed during the hospital stay
        was determined using the price list supplied by the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hospital pharmacy</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> with a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</TIMEX> family income less than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Nepalese rupees</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1 US$</NUMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">78 Nepalese rupees</NUMEX>) were taken as
        belonging to low socioeconomic status; those with a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</TIMEX>
        income <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 2000 to 4000</TIMEX> rupees and more than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4000</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rupees</ENAMEX> were taken as belonging to middle and high
        socioeconomic status respectively. The socioeconomic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">classification</ENAMEX> was worked out by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Theodore</ENAMEX> of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Community Medicine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> of our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX> with input
        from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Statistics</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Green Pasture</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hospital</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pokhara</ENAMEX>. The average per capita income of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nepal</ENAMEX>
        was the major consideration while preparing the
        classification which had been previously tested during the
        field visits by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Community Medicine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX>. Housing,
        the extent of land holdings, and material possessions owned
        by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> were examined in these field visits.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Respondents</ENAMEX> were also asked about their family income when
        interviewed in the ward, (the limitation being that we were
        entirely dependent on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">respondents</ENAMEX> answer and had no
        means to cross check the same, as in the field visits.)
        The percentage of antibiotics prescribed from the
        Essential drug list of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nepal</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] and from the WHO list of
        Essential <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DDD/100</ENAMEX> bed-days of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
        most commonly prescribed antibiotics in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal</ENAMEX>
        Medicine ward, was calculated. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DDD/100</ENAMEX> bed-days of the
        individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antibiotics</ENAMEX> were added together to get the total
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibiotic</ENAMEX> consumption. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ciprofloxacin</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDDs</ENAMEX>, one for
        oral use of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibiotic</ENAMEX> and the other for parenteral
        use. The <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 DDDs/100</NUMEX> bed-days were calculated separately and
        then were added to measure the total consumption of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ciprofloxacin</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDDs</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/100</ENAMEX> bed-days. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDD</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/100</ENAMEX> bed-days was
        calculated by the formula:
        
        The institutional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">review board</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manipal College of</ENAMEX>
        Medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sciences</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pokhara</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nepal</ENAMEX>, approved the study.

        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Two hundred</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">687</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> admitted to
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal Medicine</ENAMEX> ward were prescribed antibiotics
        during the study period. Out of the total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">203</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">112</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">55.2%</NUMEX>) were male. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One hundred and four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>
        (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">51.2%</NUMEX>) were above <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the age of 59 years</TIMEX>. Regarding the
        ethnic composition, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">56</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">27.6%</NUMEX>) were <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gurungs</ENAMEX> while
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">24.6%</NUMEX>) were <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brahmins</ENAMEX>. The other common

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.4%</NUMEX>)]. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One hundred and eighteen</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">58.1%</NUMEX>)
        belonged to an urban area while the remaining were from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rural</ENAMEX> areas.
        Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1shows</NUMEX> the number of antibiotics prescribed
        during the period of hospital stay. Ninety-eight patients
        were prescribed a single <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibiotic</ENAMEX>, while <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">75</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were
        prescribed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> antibiotics. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twenty-three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">prescribed 3</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">antibiotics</ENAMEX>, while <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 and 5</NUMEX> antibiotics were
        prescribed to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 and 2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> respectively.
        The duration of hospitalization of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">203</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> was
        recorded. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One hundred and one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">49.7%</NUMEX>) were
        hospitalized for a time period ranging from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4 to 7 days</TIMEX>.
        Median duration of hospitalization was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5 days</TIMEX> and the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interquartile</ENAMEX> range was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 days</TIMEX>. The corresponding figures
        for hospitalized <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who were not prescribed an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibiotic</ENAMEX> were <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 and 2 days</TIMEX> respectively.
        The most common condition for which an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibiotic</ENAMEX> was
        prescribed was chronic obstructive pulmonary <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> (COPD)
        (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">22.7%</NUMEX>). The other common conditions were lower respiratory

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. aureus</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>) and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. pneumoniae</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>). Table 3shows
        the antibiotic resistance patterns of the commonly isolated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4shows</ENAMEX> the number of antibiotics to which
        the commonly isolated <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> were resistant.
        The most frequent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> isolated in the sputum was 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H.</ENAMEX> influenzae (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>). These
        isolates were resistant to tetracyclines in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">17%</NUMEX> of cases,
        to chloramphenicol in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">18.2%</NUMEX> of cases, amoxicillin in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> of
        cases, cotrimoxazole in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">66%</NUMEX> of cases and erythromycin in
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">71.4%</NUMEX> of cases. In the urine 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> was the most frequent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">organism</ENAMEX> isolated, accounting for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">52.2%</NUMEX> of total organisms
        from the urine. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> patterns of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> were as follows: gentamicin
        (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">44%</NUMEX>), norfloxacin (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX>), ciprofloxacin (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">55%</NUMEX>) and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ampicillin</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">71%</NUMEX>). However, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX> of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli isolates</ENAMEX> were resistant to
        most antibiotics but were sensitive to cotrimoxazole. The
        blood cultures were negative in most of the instances.
      
      
        Discussion
        Antibiotic resistance among pathogenic microorganisms is
        a matter of worldwide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX>. Selective pressure by
        antimicrobial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> is by far the most important driving
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">force</ENAMEX> for the development of such <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX>. Antibiotics
        are among the most commonly prescribed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> in hospitals
        and in developed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> around <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX> of the hospitalized
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> are treated with these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . The present
        study documents that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">29.5%</NUMEX>of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were prescribed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antibiotics</ENAMEX>. This is very similar to the reports from
        developed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . Antibiotic prescription was
        studied over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 months</TIMEX>, the major disadvantage being that
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seasonal</TIMEX> variations in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibiotic prescribing</ENAMEX> could not be
        taken into consideration over this short period. The number
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> which were sent for culture and sensitivity
        testing were small which may also affect the validity of
        the conclusions drawn about antibiotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX>.
        Among <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> admitted to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal Medicine</ENAMEX> ward,
        there was a preponderance of those above the age of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">59</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>. This factor may have influenced antibiotic
        prescribing as older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> are more likely to be sick
        and to have more serious illnesses. Also paediatric
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (< <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12 years</TIMEX>) were not included in the analysis
        as they are admitted to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Paediatric Medicine</ENAMEX> ward.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brahmins</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gurungs</ENAMEX> were the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> major ethnic groups
        encountered in our study. The data on the ethnic
        composition of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> gives information on the
        utilization of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> by the different ethnic groups
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kaski</ENAMEX> and the neighbouring <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">districts</ENAMEX>. A substantial
        number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gurungs</ENAMEX> are ex-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">servicemen</ENAMEX> and our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> has
        tied up with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gorkha Welfare Society of the British</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gorkhas</ENAMEX>. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gorkha Welfare Scheme</ENAMEX> (GWS) has been introduced
        for these ex-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">servicemen</ENAMEX> and their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dependents</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Seven</NUMEX> of the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">56</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Gurungs</ENAMEX> were benefited by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GWS</ENAMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Sixty-eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">33.5%</NUMEX>) belonged to low
        socioeconomic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manipal Teaching Hospital</ENAMEX> is a
        private sector health care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">provider</ENAMEX> where most of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> have to pay for their treatment and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicines</ENAMEX>. We
        have created a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Poor Patients Fund</ENAMEX> (PPF) in our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> to
        help the economically deprived <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. Partial or
        sometimes even full <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concession</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> charges may be
        offered to these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thirty</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">203</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>
        (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">18.7%</NUMEX>) benefited from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPF</ENAMEX> at our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX> of these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> belonged to a low socioeconomic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>.
        The median duration of hospitalization was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5 days</TIMEX> and
        the interquartile range was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 days</TIMEX>. The majority of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were hospitalized for a time period <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 4 to 7</TIMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>. In a previous study [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intensive Care Unit</ENAMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICU</ENAMEX>) of our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>, the mean Â± SD period of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hospitalization</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.84</NUMEX> Â± <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3.14 days</TIMEX> and economic
        constraints were a major reason for seeking an early
        discharge from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICU</ENAMEX>. In this study median duration of
        hospitalization for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> receiving systemic antibiotics
        was significantly higher compared to patients not receiving
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antibiotics</ENAMEX>. This is similar to the results observed in a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Hungarian</ENAMEX> study [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">COPD</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LRTI</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTI</ENAMEX> were the most frequent clinical
        conditions for which an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibiotic</ENAMEX> was prescribed. The
        morbidity profile of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibiotic</ENAMEX> use broadly corresponds to
        that observed in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">an Indian</TIMEX> study [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . In another study
        from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] , antibiotics were most commonly used in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">respiratory</ENAMEX> tract infection and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UTI</ENAMEX> followed by <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX> and
        intra-abdominal infections. However, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> had looked
        at the entire hospital <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient population</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] .
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Sixty-seven</NUMEX> percent of antibiotics were prescribed from
        the Essential drug list of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nepal</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">65.1%</NUMEX> were
        prescribed from the WHO Essential drug list [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Manipal Teaching Hospital</ENAMEX> is a tertiary care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">provider</ENAMEX> in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pokhara</ENAMEX> valley and due to various reasons it is
        sometimes necessary to use antibiotics which may not be
        covered in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Essential drug</ENAMEX> lists. The Essential drug
        lists are mainly for primary health care and their utility
        in our study is more limited.
        The average number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> per prescription is an
        important index of a prescription audit. It is preferable
        to keep the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> per prescription as low as
        possible to minimize the risk of drug interactions,
        development of bacterial resistance and hospital costs [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>
        ] . We did not look at the co-prescribed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> here, but
        concentrated only on antibiotics. The average number of
        antibiotics prescribed during the hospital stay was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.7</NUMEX>,
        which is similar to the observation in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">an Indian</TIMEX> study [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>
        ] . The antibiotics most frequently prescribed together
        were ampicillin and gentamicin. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> or more antibiotics
        were prescribed to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in whom the antibiotics were
        changed either after reviewing the culture and sensitivity
        results or due to lack of improvement in the clinical
        condition. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> or more antibiotics were started together
        in seriously ill <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
        Mean Â± SD cost of antibiotics prescribed during the
        hospital stay was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">16.5 Â± 13.4 US$</NUMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicines</ENAMEX> were
        purchased by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> from the hospital pharmacy, the
        cost price of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> in the hospital pharmacy being less
        than the open market price,(the pharmacy buying <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicines</ENAMEX>
        in bulk and passing the discount on to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>). The
        difference in cost varied from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2 to 4%</NUMEX> for different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>.
        The total cost incurred by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> during the period
        of hospital stay was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">33.4 Â± 16.2 US$</NUMEX>. The cost incurred on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hospital</ENAMEX> and nursing charges, other co-prescribed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> and
        laboratory and other investigations were included in the
        total cost.
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Fifty-one percent</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were prescribed
        antibiotics by the parenteral route. In a study reported
        from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South India</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] , <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">36%</NUMEX> of antibiotics were prescribed
        by the parenteral route. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Israeli</ENAMEX> study [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] , <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">64%</NUMEX>
        of antibiotics were prescribed parenterally. Parenteral
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antibiotics</ENAMEX> in the study were prescribed for a median
        duration of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5 days</TIMEX> and the interquartile range was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 days</TIMEX>.
        The duration of use of parenteral antibiotics may be
        decreased and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> switched over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> to oral
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antibiotics</ENAMEX>.
        In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> a route conversion program on the prescribing
        of antimicrobials succeeded in reducing the frequency of
        use of parenteral antibiotics [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . Parenteral
        antibiotics are costly and the cost of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> is a major
        factor influencing treatment in a poor <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nepal</ENAMEX>.
        In our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> are usually discharged once the
        antibiotics are changed from the parenteral to the oral
        route. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One hundred and eighteen</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were from urban
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">areas</ENAMEX> and their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">houses</ENAMEX> were accessible by all weather
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">roads</ENAMEX>, these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> can either return to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> or
        visit a neighbouring health care <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facility</ENAMEX> in case of
        problems after being discharged. Early switchover to oral
        antibiotics may be more difficult for rural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> as
        they may have difficulty in accessing medical care in case
        of problems. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> are generally unwilling to stay
        in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> after injectable <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> have been stopped.
        Economic considerations may be partly responsible for the
        desire to continue further treatment at home. The patients
        can be educated about the need for remaining under
        observation in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> even after the stoppage of
        parenteral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>, thus a programme similar to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Canadian</ENAMEX> study could be implemented in our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> for
        cost-effective use of parenteral antibiotics.
        Antibiotics were used for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPI</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">65</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. One
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hundred</ENAMEX> and twelve patient <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antibiotics</ENAMEX> were prescribed. The
        antibiotics were started in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BPI</ENAMEX> after sending specimens for
        culture and sensitivity testing. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> the
        empirical use of the antibiotic conformed to the culture
        and sensitivity patterns of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> isolated and hence
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibiotic</ENAMEX> was continued. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> the antibiotic
        was changed after reviewing the sensitivity report. In <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> though the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> was resistant to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">antibiotic</ENAMEX>, the patient improved clinically and the use of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibiotic</ENAMEX> was continued. Delay in receiving the
        sensitivity reports was a problem encountered and may have
        delayed switching over the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> to the sensitive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibiotic</ENAMEX>. Steps which could be taken to quicken the
        report availability are:
        a) immediate transport and processing of the specimen
        after collection
        b) constant monitoring of the culture systems to detect
        growth
        c) identification of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> and antibiotic
        sensitivity testing (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AST</ENAMEX>) to be done at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> h
        d) reading of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AST</ENAMEX> to be taken <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">16 h</TIMEX> after putting the
        antibiotic disc
        e) immediate dispatch, collection and interpretation of
        the results.
        In our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> due to logistical problems these steps
        cannot be followed strictly within the specified time
        period, hence the results are delayed by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 12 to 24</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">h.</ENAMEX>
        In case of blood culture, the biphasic culture system is
        used in which growth is observed, either by detection of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">turbidity</ENAMEX> in the liquid media or by growth in the solid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">media</ENAMEX>. However, a continuous automated monitoring system
        such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BACTALERT</ENAMEX> could save a substantial amount of time.
        This system is not being used at present as the sample load
        is less and hence it is not cost effective.
        Antibiotics were used in non-BPI in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">62%</NUMEX> of the cases. In
        our previous study in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICU</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">84.5%</NUMEX> of the
        antibiotics were prescribed without bacteriological
        support. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">an Indian</TIMEX> study [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">62%</NUMEX> of prescriptions were
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">therapeutic</ENAMEX>, of which <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">36%</NUMEX> were therapeutic prescriptions
        without bacteriological support while <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">59%</NUMEX> were on a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bacteriological</ENAMEX> basis.
        Ampicillin, amoxicillin, metronidazole, ciprofloxacin
        and crystalline penicillin were the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> most commonly
        prescribed antibiotics. In many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> treatment was
        started with parenteral ampicillin which later changed to
        oral amoxicillin once the condition of the patient
        improved. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DDD/100</ENAMEX> bed-days of ampicillin was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">27.5</NUMEX> while
        that of amoxicillin was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17.5</NUMEX>. These figures are higher than
        those reported by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mikic et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . In their study the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DDD</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/100</ENAMEX> bed-days of aminopenicillins was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.1</NUMEX>; ampicillin
        was used in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">37.6%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and amoxicillin in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13.1%</NUMEX>. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibiotic</ENAMEX> use in our study was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">108.5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DDDs/100</ENAMEX> bed-days. We
        have no data on the long trends of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibiotic</ENAMEX> utilization
        in our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Castro et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] reported that the use
        of antibiotics in a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Brazilian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> had increased from
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">83.8</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DDDs/100</ENAMEX> bed-days in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">124.6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DDDs/100</ENAMEX> bed-days
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX>. The introduction of a hospital antibiotic policy
        helped to reduce <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibiotic</ENAMEX> utilization at a university
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hospital</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45.9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DDDs/100</ENAMEX> bed-days to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32.9 DDDs/100</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">bed-days</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] .
        The use of cephalosporins in our study was less than
        that reported in the literature [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21</NUMEX> ] . However, direct
        comparisons of cephalosporin utilization may not be
        appropriate as one of the studies [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] was carried out
        both inside and outside of health care <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">facilities</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Norway</ENAMEX>
        while the other study [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] was carried in a rural
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hospital</ENAMEX>. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Norwegian</ENAMEX> study, cephalosporins
        represented <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16%</NUMEX> of the use of antibacterials in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>,
        while in the study carried out at a rural <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ceftriaxone</ENAMEX> and cefuroxime together accounted for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30.8%</NUMEX> of
        the total antibiotic <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>. Antibiotic utilization in
        different specialties may have been considered in the above
        studies [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21</NUMEX> ] while our study was confined to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal Medicine</ENAMEX> ward. The isolated <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> are becoming
        resistant to the commonly used antibiotics and
        cephalosporins may have to be prescribed in resistant
        cases. Cephalosporins are available in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>
        pharmacy but more data on sensitivity patterns is required
        before they can be more frequently prescribed.
        A total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">163</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> were isolated from the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">specimens</ENAMEX> sent for culture and sensitivity testing. The
        small number of specimens may, however, limit conclusions
        about antibiotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX>. Carrying out the study for a
        longer period of time could partly overcome this lacuna. 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H.</ENAMEX> influenzae, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">K.</ENAMEX> pneumoniae, S.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aureus</ENAMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> pneumoniae were the commonest
        organisms isolated and were resistant to cotrimoxazole,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chloramphenicol</ENAMEX> and co-amoxiclav in a significant number of
        cases. This maybe, is one of the reasons for the decreased
        use of sulfonamides in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal Medicine</ENAMEX> ward. Urine
        was the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> most common specimen sent for culture and
        sensitivity testing. In a study reported from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trinidad</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX>
        ] , 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> was the most frequent isolate
        from urine samples and was mostly resistant to
        tetracycline, trimethoprim and cotrimoxazole. The low
        number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> in our study makes it difficult to draw
        firm conclusions but an increasing resistance of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> and 
        S. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aureus</ENAMEX> to commonly used
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antibiotics</ENAMEX> is observed.
        Antibiotic resistance is an increasingly encountered
        problem in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal Medicine</ENAMEX> ward of our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>. We
        are in the process of formulating an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibiotic</ENAMEX> use policy
        and at present, only have <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibiotic</ENAMEX> use guidelines for the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal Medicine</ENAMEX>. We are working to develop
        a system to recognize and report trends in antibiotic
        resistance within our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">institution</ENAMEX>. However, a system to
        rapidly detect and report resistant <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> in individual
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> should be in place to ensure a rapid response by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">caregivers</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prevention</ENAMEX> and control of the spread of
        antibiotic-resistant <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> will require increased
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adherence</ENAMEX> to basic infection control policies and
        procedures, incorporation of antimicrobial resistance
        strategies into institutional goals and development of a
        plan to deal with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> colonized with resistant
        organisms [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] .
        In a recent study [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] , a vast majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX>
        (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">97%</NUMEX>) believed that widespread and inappropriate use of
        antimicrobials was an important cause of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX>.
        However, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 60%</NUMEX> favoured restricting the use of
        broad-spectrum antibiotics [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . Also it has been found
        that the public health <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> of contributing to the
        problem of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibiotic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> does not exert a strong
        impact on physician prescribing decisions for community
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">acquired pneumonia</ENAMEX>. All these factors may have to be taken
        into consideration while developing a programme to reduce
        the use of antibiotics.
      
      
        Conclusions
        The high rate of prescription of parenteral antibiotics
        is a matter of concern. Decreasing the prescribing of
        parenteral antibiotics and an early switch to oral
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antibiotics</ENAMEX> will significantly reduce the expenditure
        incurred. An intravenous to oral antibiotic conversion
        program can be instituted. Quickening the availability of
        culture and sensitivity reports will enable the treatment
        to have a sound bacteriological basis. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Antibiotic</ENAMEX>
        resistance is becoming a problem and formulation of a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hospital antibiotic</ENAMEX> use policy is a matter of urgent
        concern. An educational programme and an antibiotic order
        form may be useful initiatives to reduce <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibiotic</ENAMEX> use.
        Guidelines for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibiotic</ENAMEX> use in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> and
        restricting the level of health care <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">practitioners</ENAMEX> who can
        prescribe antibiotics are required.
