        Metabotropic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glutamate receptors</ENAMEX> (mGluRs) are a family
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">class 3 G protein-coupled receptors</ENAMEX> with important
        functions in the regulation of synaptic transmission,
        plasticity, neuronal excitability, and the regulation
        sensory transduction [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3 4 5</NUMEX> ] . The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> mGluRs
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">mGluR1-8</ENAMEX>) and their splice variants have been divided into
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (I-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">III</ENAMEX>) based on sequence homology,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pharmacology</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> protein coupling profiles [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 6 7</NUMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group II</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mGluR2</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">III</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mGluR4</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> through <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">8</ENAMEX>)

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mGluRs</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mGluR1</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> to multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">native</ENAMEX> and heterologous systems, and have been observed to

        s [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9 10 11 12 13 14 15</NUMEX> ] . mGluRs
        appear to be important <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediators</ENAMEX> of synaptic transmission
        in the brain. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> I mGluRs typically are located
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">postsynaptically</ENAMEX> (as well as in other compartments of the
        cell) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 17 18</NUMEX> ] where they regulate activity of
        ionotropic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> and are necessary in some forms of
        synaptic plasticity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of mGluRs with
        scaffolding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Homer</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> I; [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] ) and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PICK-1</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group III</ENAMEX>; [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] ) is important in regulating
        mGluR localization and function [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 22 23 24</NUMEX> ] . In
        addition to those <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> involved in scaffolding, other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> have been shown to associate with mGluRs. For
        example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> I and group III <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mGluRs</ENAMEX> are both known to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bind Calmodulin</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CaM</ENAMEX>) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 26</NUMEX> ] . In the case of group III
        mGluRs, the interaction with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CaM</ENAMEX> is important in regulating
        the efficacy of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> protein <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">activation</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27 28</NUMEX> ] . CaM
        binding to both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> I and group III <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mGluRs</ENAMEX> can be
        inhibited by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">serine</ENAMEX>/threonine phosphorylation at specific
        sites [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 28</NUMEX> ] . Therefore, it is of interest in terms of
        mGluR function and localization to understand the roles of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> which interact with these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seven</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Absentia</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SinA</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> was discovered in
        Drosophila as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediator</ENAMEX> of photoreceptor development [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX>
        ] . Subsequently, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">SinA</ENAMEX> was shown to participate in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ubiquitin/proteasome</ENAMEX> pathway [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30 31</NUMEX> ] . The presence of a
        RING finger domain in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N-terminus</ENAMEX> of the mammalian
        homologue of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SinA</ENAMEX>, "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Siah</ENAMEX>", suggests it may be involved in
        targeting specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> for degradation in the
        proteasome as a ubiquitin ligase [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> mammalian
        genes encoding <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Siah</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Siah1 and 2</TIMEX>, are known. These proteins
        have been implicated in many processes including <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX> ] , apoptosis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] and cell cycle regulation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] .
        More recently, an interaction between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Siah1a</TIMEX> and the
        C-terminal tail of group I mGluRs was demonstrated [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] .
        This interaction was specific for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> I mGluRs, as it was
        not observed in the analogous sequences from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> II
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">mGluR2</NUMEX>) or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">III</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">mGluR7</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>. Due to the
        novelty of the mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">homolog</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seven</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Absentia</ENAMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Siah</ENAMEX>), little information is available regarding its
        tissue distribution or subcellular localization in
        mammalian cells. To date the functional consequences of
        Siah1a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> I mGluRs are unknown.
        To assess the role of Siah1a binding, specific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> I
        mGluRs were heterologously expressed in sympathetic neurons
        from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> superior cervical ganglion (SCG), which do not
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">natively</ENAMEX> express mGluRs [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37 38</NUMEX> ] . The functional role of
        Siah1a was assessed by examining calcium current inhibition
        mediated by the expressed mGluRs in the absence and
        presence of heterologous <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Siah1a</ENAMEX> expression. In addition,
        the surface expression and subcellular distribution of
        group I mGluRs was examined with and without Siah1a using
        various fluorescence techniques. Finally, the effect of CaM
        overexpression on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Siah1a</NUMEX> function was assessed.
      
      
        Results and Discussion
        
          Coexpression of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Siah1a</TIMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> I mGluRs
          To examine the role of Siah1a expression on mGluR
          function, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCG</ENAMEX> neurons were injected with cDNA encoding
          several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> I mGluRs (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mGluR1</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> and their splice
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variants</ENAMEX>) with or without Siah1a expression. Calcium
          current modulation was then examined upon application of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">extracellular 100 Î¼M</ENAMEX> glutamate. The triple pulse voltage
          protocol [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] was used as the standard test pulse to
          assess calcium current magnitude and voltage dependence
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibition</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38 40</NUMEX> ] . Figure 1Aillustrates sample
          current traces from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">before</TIMEX> ("con") and during inhibition
          by glutamate ("<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Glu</ENAMEX>"), in an mGluR5b-expressing cell.
          Consistent with previous reports [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 38</NUMEX> ] , calcium
          current inhibition via <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mGluR5b</ENAMEX> appeared partially voltage
          dependent. The time course of inhibition by glutamate and
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î¼M</NUMEX> norepinephrine (NE), acting through endogenous Î± 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> adrenergic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ] , in
          this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> (figure 1B) illustrates that inhibition was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rapid</ENAMEX> and reversible.
          In contrast to that in cells expressing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mGluR5b</TIMEX> alone,
          calcium current inhibition by glutamate in cells
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coexpressing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mGluR5b</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Siah1a</ENAMEX> was quite small (figure
          1C). Average inhibition of calcium currents by glutamate
          in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">mGluR5b</NUMEX>-expressing cells was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">33 Â± 5%</NUMEX>, (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>).
          Inhibition was significantly reduced to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> Â± <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6%</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>; p
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>) in cells coexpressing <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mGluR5b</ENAMEX> and Siah1a
          (figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). This reduction of modulation by glutamate
          appeared to be specific for mGluRs, as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NE</ENAMEX>-mediated
          calcium current inhibition was unaltered (figure <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ID</ENAMEX>).
          Calcium current inhibition resulting from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NE</ENAMEX> application
          in mGluR-expressing cells was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">58 Â± 6%</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>). In cells
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coexpressing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Siah1a</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NE</ENAMEX> produced an inhibition of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">54</NUMEX> Â± <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6%</NUMEX>
          (n = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>; figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
          The strong reduction in calcium current modulation by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">glutamate</ENAMEX> in the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Siah1a</ENAMEX> was observed with
          every <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> I mGluR tested. Cells expressing an
          extracellularly myc-tagged mGluR5a (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">mGluR5a</NUMEX>-myc)
          exhibited calcium current inhibition of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42</NUMEX> Â± <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4%</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>)
          upon glutamate application. This inhibition was
          significantly reduced to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> Â± <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>) in cells
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coexpressing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Siah1a</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX>; figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). Similarly,
          calcium current inhibition in cells expressing a
          C-terminally GFP-tagged mGluR1a (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">mGluR1a</NUMEX>-GFP) and
          mGluR1a-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">GFP</NUMEX> + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Siah1a</NUMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">46 Â± 5%</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX> Â± <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6%</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> =
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>), respectively. In addition to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> I mGluRs, mGluR2
          (a group <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">II mGluR</ENAMEX>) was also examined. However, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Siah1a</TIMEX> had
          no detectable effect on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">mGluR2</NUMEX>-mediated calcium current
          inhibition, consistent with reports demonstrating that
          Siah1a does not bind to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> II mGluRs [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] . Cells
          expressing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mGluR2</TIMEX> alone exhibited <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">57</NUMEX> Â± <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> inhibition of
          calcium current in response to glutamate (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>), while
          those coexpressing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Siah1a</ENAMEX> were inhibited <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">61</NUMEX> Â± <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2%</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>;
          figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). Together, these data demonstrate that in the
          presence of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Siah1a</TIMEX>, the function of group I mGluRs is
          selectively inhibited. These data also suggest that
          Siah1a is acting at the level of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>, since much
          of the calcium current modulation through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> I mGluRs
          proceeds through a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">GÎ²Î³</ENAMEX>-mediated pathway similar to that
          used by Î± 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> adrenergic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mGluR2</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> ] .
        
        
          Effect of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Siah1a</TIMEX> on mGluR surface expression and
          localization
          The reduction in group I mGluR signaling induced by
          Siah1a expression may be attributed to several possible
          mechanisms. For example, binding of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Siah1a</NUMEX> to the
          C-terminus of group I mGluRs may occlude the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> or
          regions responsible for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> protein <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">activation</ENAMEX>. This is
          possible since both Siah1a binding and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> protein
          activation have been attributed to areas on the
          C-terminus of group I mGluRs [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36 42 43</NUMEX> ] .
          Alternatively, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Siah1a</TIMEX> binding may alter the 'normal'
          interactions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> with scaffolding proteins
          or may cause the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> to be targeted for degradation
          in the proteasome, effectively reducing the number of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> that are 'correctly' assembled, or the number
          of functional <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> at the membrane. The latter
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hypothesis</ENAMEX> predicts a reduction in mGluR cell surface
          expression or perhaps a change in surface distribution in
          the presence of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Siah1a</TIMEX>, such as occurs in the presence of
          Homer <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 44 45</NUMEX> ] . To test whether Siah1a
          expression altered the surface expression of group I
          mGluRs, the surface distribution of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">mGluR5a</NUMEX>-myc was
          examined in the absence and presence of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Siah1a</TIMEX>. The
          subcellular distribution of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">mGluR1a</NUMEX>-GFP was also examined
          with and without <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Siah1a</ENAMEX>.
          Figure 3A( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">upper</ENAMEX> ) illustrates a cell injected
          with cDNA encoding <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">mGluR5a</NUMEX>-myc alone (and coexpressing
          pEGFP as a positive marker for expression). <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Column 1</ENAMEX>
          ("Phase") and column 2 ("<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">GFP</ENAMEX>") show a phase contrast
          image and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> fluorescence of such a cell. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Column 3</ENAMEX>
          ("<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-myc</ENAMEX> cy3") shows surface labeling of the
          extracullular myc epitope on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">mGluR5a</NUMEX>-myc using a cy3
          fluorescently-conjugated primary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX>. Live cells
          were exposed to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> prior to fixation to ensure that
          only <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> expressed on the cell surface would be
          detected. Uninjected cells displayed no detectable cy3
          labeling (data not shown). In similarly treated cells
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coexpressing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Siah1a</ENAMEX>, surface expression, measured as
          total cell fluorescence (figure 3B), was not
          significantly reduced (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.33</NUMEX>) and no receptor
          clustering was observed (figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3A</TIMEX>, 
          lower ). Similar experiments using
          a GFP-tagged <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> I mGluR, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-mGluR1a</ENAMEX>, indicated no
          detectable changes in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> distribution when
          coexpressed with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Siah1a</TIMEX> (figure 3C). These data suggest
          that neither a reduction in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> levels nor a change
          in receptor association with scaffolding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> appears
          to be responsible for the diminished <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> I
          mGluR-mediated calcium current modulation observed in the
          presence of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Siah1a</TIMEX>.
        
        
          Does Siah1a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target group</ENAMEX> I mGluRs for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteolysis</ENAMEX>?
          Siah1a has been shown to be a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the ubiquitin
          family of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> involved in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> degradation
          through the proteasome [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30 31 33</NUMEX> ] . Therefore, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> I
          mGluR degradation was considered a potential mechanism
          for the decrease in mGluR-mediated calcium current
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">modulation</ENAMEX> observed in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCG</ENAMEX> neurons. Although an obvious
          decrease in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> levels in the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Siah1a</ENAMEX> was
          not detected (figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>), it is possible that introduction
          of high levels of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Siah1a</TIMEX> changed the rate of mGluR
          degradation such that a new equilibrium was reached with
          lower levels of active <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> than in the absence of
          Siah1a. Such a change may have been difficult to detect
          with the fluorescence techniques used here (figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>).
          Therefore, a deletion mutant of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Siah1a</ENAMEX> was constructed,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-Siah1a-CT</ENAMEX>, with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal RING-fmger domain
          deleted. This RING-fmger domain has been shown to be
          necessary for the ubiquitination function of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Siah1a</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46</NUMEX>
          ] . As a positive control for expression, this construct
          was fused to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C-terminus</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GFP</ENAMEX> (figure 5A). Figure
          4Aillustrates sample currents from a cell expressing
          mGluR5a alone. As with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mGluR5b</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mGluR5a</ENAMEX> produced a rapid
          and reversible calcium current inhibition when <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> Î¼M
          glutamate was applied to the bath (figure 4B).
          Coexpression of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-Siah1a</ENAMEX>-CT caused a significant
          reduction in the magnitude of calcium current modulation
          via mGluR5a (figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4C</TIMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>). Glutamate-mediated calcium
          current inhibition in cells expressing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mGluR5a</TIMEX> alone was
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX> Â± <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4%</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>). In <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells expressing mGluR5a</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GFP-Siah1a-CT</ENAMEX>, inhibition was reduced to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">14 Â± 3</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>; p
          < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX>; figure 5B). Therefore, a ubiquitin-deficient
          Siah1a construct that can bind mGluRs is capable of
          producing a similar reduction in mGluR-mediated calcium
          current modulation as the full length <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Siah1a</TIMEX>. This
          suggests that the effect of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Siah1a</TIMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> I mGluRs is a
          result of its physical association with the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>,
          rather than a change in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> levels.
        
        
          The role of Calmodulin
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calmodulin</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CaM</ENAMEX>), a calcium binding protein
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intricately</ENAMEX> involved in intracellular signaling,
          interacts with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal tail of group I mGluRs [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>
          ] . This interaction appears to be dynamically regulated.
          Phosphorylation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> at specific sites
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">prevents CaM</ENAMEX> binding to mGluRs [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Association of</ENAMEX>
          Siah1a with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> I mGluRs can also prevent the
          interaction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CaM</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] . This
          competition for binding was predicted due to the overlap
          in binding <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal tail for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CaM</ENAMEX> and
          Siah1a [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] . Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CaM</ENAMEX> has been known to associate
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> I mGluRs for some time, the functional role of
          this interaction is unknown. However, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CaM</ENAMEX> can also
          interact with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> III <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mGluRs</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 28</NUMEX> ] . Recent data
          suggests that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CaM</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> III
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mGluRs</ENAMEX> is necessary for normal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> protein <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">activation</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX>
          ] . By analogy to group III <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mGluRs</ENAMEX>, the ability of Siah1a
          to compete with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CaM</ENAMEX> for binding to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> I mGluRs was
          considered a potential mechanism for the actions of
          Siah1a on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> I mGluR-mediated calcium current
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inhibition</ENAMEX>. Therefore, overexpression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CaM</ENAMEX> was tested
          for its ability to reverse the effect of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Siah1a</TIMEX>.
          Calcium current inhibition in cells expressing the
          group I mGluR, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mGluR5b</TIMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">29 Â± 2%</NUMEX> (figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>; n = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX>),
          similar to that through other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> I mGluRs tested (see
          figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). Coexpression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Siah1a</ENAMEX> caused a reduction in
          calcium current modulation to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> Â± <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3%</NUMEX>, as observed
          previously (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>). Next, when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CaM</ENAMEX> was coexpressed with
          mGluR5b and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Siah1a</ENAMEX>, calcium current modulation was
          significantly increased (over that in cells expressing
          mGluR5b and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Siah1a</ENAMEX>) to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> Â± <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>; figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>).
          Finally, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CaM</ENAMEX> binding to the mGluRs did not appear to be
          Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+-dependent. When results obtained in the presence of
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">11 mM EGTA</TIMEX>, a relatively high level of Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+buffering,
          were compared to those in low Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+buffering (with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX> mM
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intracellular BAPTA</ENAMEX>), no difference was detected. Under
          low Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+-buffering conditions, calcium current
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inhibition</ENAMEX> in control (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mGluR5b</TIMEX> alone) was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25 Â± 4%</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> =
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>). With <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Siah1a</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Siah1a</NUMEX> + <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">CaM</ENAMEX> inhibition was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> Â± <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6%</NUMEX> (n
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">= 3</ENAMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> Â± <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">18%</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>), respectively. Since the
          results were indistinguishable with high or low Ca
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+buffering, the data from both sets were pooled in the
          final results (figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). It should also be noted that
          coexpression of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CaM with mGluR5a</ENAMEX> in the absence of Siah1a
          yields no changes in calcium current modulation (data not
          shown). These results indicate that the presence of high
          levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CaM</ENAMEX> can reverse the effect of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Siah1a</TIMEX> on calcium
          current modulation, presumably by competing for binding
          on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal tail of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>.
          The data imply <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> possible mechanisms for the effect
          of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Siah1a</TIMEX> on mGluR signaling: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First, CaM</ENAMEX> association with
          group I mGluRs increases <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> protein coupling (or perhaps
          is required, as may be the case with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> III <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mGluRs</ENAMEX>).
          This model predicts that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Siah1a</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> produces its
          effect by disrupting the interaction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CaM</ENAMEX> with the
          group I mGluRs. In this case, it must be assumed that
          under control conditions (cells heterologously expressing
          only the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>), mGluRs associate with
          natively-expressed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">CaM</ENAMEX>. CaM expression levels would
          presumably be much lower natively than in cells injected
          with CaM cDNA. When <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Siah1a</ENAMEX> is caused to express
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heterologously</ENAMEX> (at presumably high levels) it expresses
          at levels high enough to out-compete <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">native CaM</ENAMEX> for mGluR
          binding.
          Alternatively, the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Siah1a</ENAMEX> itself may
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">occlude G</ENAMEX> protein coupling, with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CaM</ENAMEX> interaction
          being incidental. Since a portion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal tail
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> I mGluRs is involved in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> protein <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">activation</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43</NUMEX> ] , this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> is plausible. However, only the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">proximal ~</ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal tail appear to
          be involved in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> protein coupling. The site of Siah1a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interaction</ENAMEX> is ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues distal</ENAMEX> to that site [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] .
          Although this does not rule out this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>, it suggests
          that it may be less likely than the former <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">model</ENAMEX>, which
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">implicates CaM</ENAMEX> as the pivotal interacting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>.
          However, until a more detailed picture of these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interactions</ENAMEX> is available, it will be difficult to answer
          this question definitively. Nonetheless, the data
          presented here suggest a novel role for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Siah1a</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CaM</ENAMEX> in
          regulating the function of group I mGluRs.
          The notion that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Siah</ENAMEX>, a putative ubiquitin ligase,
          would have other roles in cell signaling is not
          surprising. Many RING-finger-containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that may
          act as ubiquitin ligases under certain conditions have
          otherwise diverse structures and functions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] . It is
          clear that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Siah</ENAMEX> can act in the ubiquitin pathway,
          targeting some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> for proteolysis, under certain
          circumstances. In addition, the data presented here do
          not rule out the possibility that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Siah</ENAMEX> may target <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> I
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mGluRs</ENAMEX> to the proteasome should they become damaged,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">misfolded</ENAMEX> or should other conditions in the cell warrant
          mGluR proteolysis. At this time however, there is no
          evidence to support this claim. Still, it appears likely
          that Siah1a may play an important role in mGluR signaling
          in addition to any putative function regarding the
          proteasome pathway.
          Further studies will be needed to determine if group I
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mGluRs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Siah1a interact physiologically</ENAMEX>, and whether
          this interaction has functional consequences. For
          example, are these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> coexpressed in certain
          regions of the brain? Do they co-localize when expressed
          in a particular cell type? If the results presented here
          can be exprapolated to physiological situations that
          involve <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> I mGluRs, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Siah1a</TIMEX> expression in the
          mammalian nervous system could potentially play a role in
          cell excitability by influencing mGluR-mediated potassium
          current modulation (of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX>-type currents and perhaps of
          GIRK currents), and synaptic plasticity due to the role
          that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> I mGluRs play in these processes [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 5 38</NUMEX> ]
          .
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        The findings described here demonstrate that the
        mammalian homologue of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> in absentia, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Siah1a</ENAMEX> regulates
        the function of group I metabotropic glutamate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>.
        Sympathetic neurons from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> SCG that were made to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">express Siah1a</ENAMEX> with a group I mGluR attenuated
        mGluR-mediated calcium current modulation. This attenuation
        did not appear to be accompanied by a reduction in cell
        surface expression levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> nor by an obvious
        change in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> distribution in the cells. Further, a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mutant of Siah1a</ENAMEX> was constructed with the RING finger
        domain deleted, such that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> was unable to act in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ubiquitin</ENAMEX>/proteasome pathway [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX> ] . This deletion
        construct was as effective in attenuating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> I mGluR
        function as the wild type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Siah1a</ENAMEX>, providing supporting
        evidence that the effect of Siah1a resulted from its
        physical association with the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>, rather than
        through a resulting reduction in receptor expression
        levels. Finally, coexpression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CaM</ENAMEX> reversed the effect of
        Siah1a on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mGluR5b</TIMEX>, indicating that the interaction of CaM
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Siah1a</ENAMEX> in binding to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> I mGluRs plays a novel and
        important role in mGluR function.

          from <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1-3 MÎ©</ENAMEX>, yielding uncompensated series resistances of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2-7 MÎ©</ENAMEX>. Series resistance compensation of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX> was used in
          all recordings. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> were recorded using an <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Axopatch</ENAMEX> 200A
          patch clamp amplifier from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Axon Instruments</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Foster City</ENAMEX>,
          CA). Voltage protocol <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> and data acquisition
          were performed using custom data acquisition software on
          a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Macintosh</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Quadra series</ENAMEX> computer with a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MacAdios II</ENAMEX>

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MA</ENAMEX>). Currents were sampled at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> kHz low-pass filtered
          at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> kHz using the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-pole Bessel filter in the patch
          clamp amplifier, digitized, and stored on the computer
          for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later</TIMEX> analysis. Experiments were preformed at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX>-24Â°C
          (room temperature). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> analysis was performed using
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Igor</ENAMEX> software (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WaveMetrics</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lake Oswego</ENAMEX>, OR). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Statistical</ENAMEX>

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institute, Cary</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NC</ENAMEX>).
          In all recordings, the external (bath) solution
          contained (in mM): <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">145</NUMEX> tetraethylammonium (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TEA</ENAMEX>)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">methanesulfonate</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MS</ENAMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 4</NUMEX>-(<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-Hydroxy

          Immuno fluorescence and imaging
          To detect surface expression of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">mGluR5a</NUMEX>-myc
          construct, a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">cy3</NUMEX>-conjugated, mouse anti-myc antibody
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma</ENAMEX>) was applied to live cells at room temperature for
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20 minutes</TIMEX> at a <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1:150</ENAMEX> dilution. Cells were subsequently
          fixed in a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">formaldehyde</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fisher</ENAMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4%</NUMEX> sucrose
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fisher</ENAMEX>) solution in phosphate buffered saline (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>) for
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20 minutes</TIMEX>, washed with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> and imaged. Images were
          acquired using a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Spot RT Monochrome</ENAMEX>, cooled <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CCD</ENAMEX> camera
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diagnostic Instruments, Inc.</ENAMEX>) mounted onto a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nikon</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Eclipse TE300</ENAMEX> inverted microscope with a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">40X</NUMEX> objective
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nikon</ENAMEX>). Images were obtained using Spot software
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diagnostic Instruments</ENAMEX>) and figures were constructed
          using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adobe Photoshop</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Canvas</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Deneba Systems</ENAMEX>)
          software. Image analysis was performed using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NIH Image</ENAMEX>
          software. All images analyzed in figure 3Bwere taken
          using a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 second</NUMEX> exposure, chosen to put the majority of
          cells' fluorescence near the center of the camera's
          dynamic range. Images of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> cells (out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38</NUMEX>) were
          discarded for having large areas of saturation. Using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>
          bit images, total fluorescence of a small area
          encompassing the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> was measured and the
          fluorescence of an identically sized area of background
          was subtracted to yield a measure of total fluorescence
          for each cell. Since there was no detectable change in
          cell size accompanying Siah1a expression measured
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electrophysiologically</ENAMEX> (data not shown), the fluorescence
          measurments were not normalized to total area.
