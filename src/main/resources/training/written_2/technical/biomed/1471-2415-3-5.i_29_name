        The retina, which is exposed to both sunlight and very
        high levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX>, is exceptionally rich in
        polyunsaturated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fatty acids</ENAMEX>, which makes it a favorable
        environment for the generation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">reactive oxygen species</ENAMEX>.
        For example, retinal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pigment epithelium</ENAMEX> (RPE) generates a
        number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">reactive oxygen</ENAMEX> species when illuminated with
        light [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . Furthermore, phagocytosis of photoreceptor
        outer segments by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPE</ENAMEX> causes an increase in intracellular [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ] and extracellular H 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . Oxidative stress
        has been suggested as the cause of a number of retinal
        pathological conditions [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5</NUMEX> ] .
        A number of 
        in vitro studies have attempted to
        characterize the effect of oxidative stress on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPE</ENAMEX>.
        Depending on the experimental conditions, treatment of RPE
        with H 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> can cause an alteration of cellular
        functions [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7</NUMEX> ] or cell death [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cytotoxic</ENAMEX> levels
        of H 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> can cause significant mitochondrial [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> ] and genomic [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] DNA damage in RPE simulating the
        features of programmed cell death [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8 12</ENAMEX> ] . Studies from
        other cell types indicate that early cellular events
        following H 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> treatment include morphological
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alterations</ENAMEX> and actin re-organization [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . In addition,
        activation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERK</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">p42/44</NUMEX>, Extracellular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal-Regulated Kinase</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MAP kinases</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitogen-Activated</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Protein kinases</ENAMEX>) can occur within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX> following
        cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">oxidative</ENAMEX> stress. Depending on the cell type
        examined, inhibition of the ERK activity can either prevent
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] or enhance H 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> -induced cell death [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . The
        involvement of actin re-organization and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERK</ENAMEX> activation has
        not been examined in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPE</ENAMEX> under oxidative <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX>.
        Lipid peroxidation products, such as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-hydroxynonenal
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4-HNE</ENAMEX>), have attracted considerable attention because of
        their potential involvement in aging and in a number of
        neuropathological conditions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-HNE was implicated
        in the etiology of some pathological conditions in the eye.
        For example, levels of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HNE</ENAMEX> increased significantly in the
        vitreous of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with proliferative vitreoretinopathy
        compared with controls [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . Further, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HNE</ENAMEX> forms a
        stable adduct with rhodopsin in the photoreceptor, which
        may interfere with its functions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-HNE even causes
        cataracts in cultured <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> lens [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 20</NUMEX> ] . Whether
        oxidative <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPE</ENAMEX> can cause accumulation of cellular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HNE-protein</ENAMEX> adducts remains unknown.
        Peroxisome proliferator-activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> (PPARs)
        belong to a group of nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> that include
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">steroid</ENAMEX>, retinoid, thyroid hormone <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> and others [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 22 23</NUMEX> ] . There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> types of PPARs: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPARÎ±</ENAMEX> is
        expressed predominantly in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX>, heart, kidney, brown
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adipose</ENAMEX> and stomach mucosa, and is important for lipid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">catabolism</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPARÎ³</ENAMEX> is found in adipose tissues and is
        important for adipogenesis. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPARÎ²</ENAMEX> is found in most tissues,
        but its role is less well defined. RPE cells express all
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> forms of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPARs</ENAMEX> but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPARÎ²</ENAMEX> is the dominant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">isoform</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>
        ] . There is a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10-fold</NUMEX> induction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPARÎ³</ENAMEX> mRNA that reaches
        a peak at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4-hour</TIMEX> after phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer
        segments. The levels of either <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPARÎ±</ENAMEX> mRNA or PPARÎ² mRNA are
        not altered under the same conditions. Increases in PPARÎ³
        in RPE cells may be important for handling the lipids
        generated during the phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer
        segments [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] . Since RPE cells generate large amounts of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> during the phagocytosis of
        photoreceptor outer segments, there is a possibility that
        activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPARÎ³</ENAMEX> may assist in defending the oxidative
        stress associated with phagocytosis.
        This study was designed to examine morphological
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alterations</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPE</ENAMEX> during oxidative <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX>, the involvement
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ERK MAP kinase</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HNE</ENAMEX> and to test the hypothesis that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPARÎ³</ENAMEX> activation can prevent oxidative damage on RPE cells.
        The human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RPE</ENAMEX> cell line, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ARPE-19</ENAMEX>, and primary cultures of
        adult human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RPE</ENAMEX> were used in this study. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ARPE-19</ENAMEX> is a
        spontaneous occurring, non-transformed RPE cell line which
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">expresses RPE</ENAMEX> specific markers (such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CRALBP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RPE65</ENAMEX>)
        and exhibits morphological polarization and tight junctions
        similar to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">native RPE</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 26</NUMEX> ] .

          Cell cultures
          
          ARPE-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] were obtained
          from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Type Culture</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Collection</ENAMEX> and grown in

          Human primary RPE cultures were
          established from donor eyes obtained from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arkansas</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lions Eye Bank & Laboratory</ENAMEX>. The globe was sectioned

          Cells were pretreated with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPARÎ³</ENAMEX> agonist <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15d</NUMEX>-PGJ 
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 overnight</TIMEX> followed by H

          Subsequent experiments with ARPE-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> cells also indicated
          this saving effect. While H

          at a high concentration (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">40 Î¼M</NUMEX>), however, the difference

          Activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERK</ENAMEX> by H 2O 2
          A set of experiments was performed to determine the

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> on ERK activation. ARPE-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> cells
          were treated with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX> mM H 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 hour</TIMEX> and processed for
          immunohistochemical staining using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> against
          phospho-ERK. Untreated cells showed a faint phospho-ERK
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">staining</ENAMEX> while there was an apparent increase of
          phospho-ERK staining in the cytoplasm and nuclei in H

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> treatment of the cells caused only a
          slight alteration in ERK levels but led to a

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stimulation</ENAMEX> observed at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.5 mM</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6C). Densitometry
          analyses from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> independent experiments indicated that

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> challenge. Results from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
          independent experiments indicated that this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> could
          prevent low-dose (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.2</NUMEX> mM) H

        Discussion
        
          Cytotoxicity of oxidative stress on RPE
          Results from this study indicated that both primary
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human RPE</ENAMEX> cultures and ARPE-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> cells were susceptible to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> treatment. It is important to point
          out that H 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX> showed a very steep dose-response
          curve in primary RPE cultures under our experimental
          conditions such that an increase of H 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> concentration from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> mM to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.2</NUMEX> mM
          for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one-day</TIMEX> treatment caused a decrease in viability from
          ~<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100% to ~10%</NUMEX> of control (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1A). Though the H 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> titration curve in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ARPE-19</ENAMEX> was not
          as steep as observed in primary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPE</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one-day</TIMEX> treatment of
          these cells with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.8</NUMEX> mM H 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2</ENAMEX> could decrease the cellular
          viability to ~<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> of control while <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> mM H 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> did not affect cellular viability
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1B). The sharp dose-response curves demonstrated in
          this study suggests that it is important to have an
          effective cellular anti-oxidation mechanism to prevent
          the build-up of oxidative stress over a critical level.
          An increase of oxidative stress in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPE</ENAMEX> is associated with
          an increase of cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">catalase</ENAMEX>, metallothionein [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ]
          and glutathione S-transferase [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] , which should serve
          as a protective mechanism to decrease the cytotoxicity
          caused by H 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">reactive oxygen species</ENAMEX>.
          This protective mechanism declines with age because a
          study analyzing metallothionein levels in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPE</ENAMEX> of macular
          region showed a dramatic decrease in aged <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX> (mean
          age = <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">80-yr</NUMEX>) as compared to those from younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX>
          (mean <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">58-yr</NUMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] . A separate report concluded
          that there was also an age-dependent decrease of catalase
          activity in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPE</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] . These studies suggest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPE</ENAMEX> in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elderly</ENAMEX> are more susceptible to oxidative stress induced
          damage, which may contribute to age-related RPE
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dysfunction</ENAMEX> and vision loss. The oxidative stress induced
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPE</ENAMEX> cytotoxicity can be aggravated by <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">zinc deficiency</ENAMEX>, as
          previously reported by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tate et al.</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] .
          Significant morphological changes were observed in RPE
          cells treated with a cytotoxic concentration of H 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> . Actin fiber re-organization was
          noticed as early as <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15 minutes</TIMEX> after treatment (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
          Those images presented in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2D,2<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eand</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2Fare</ENAMEX> three

          2F are commonly seen at different locations on the same
          slide. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2D, the dense peripheral bands of actin
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> were very prominent in some cells and the high
          intensity fluorescence caused an impression that the
          cells were relatively empty. The thickening of dense
          peripheral bands in this study was in contrast to
          previous observations in endothelial cells. For example,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhao</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Davis</ENAMEX> reported that cultured pulmonary
          endothelial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> treated with H 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> underwent a morphological change
          that was accompanied by an accumulation/increase in
          stress fibers running across the cells while the dense
          peripheral bands of most cells were disrupted or
          eliminated [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] . Similar observations on endothelial
          cells were made by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liu</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sundqvist</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] . The dense
          peripheral bands are important in cell-cell adhesion,
          which maintains the structural integrity. While it is
          apparent that endothelial cells used in those studies and
          epithelial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> used in this study respond differently
          to H 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , the underlying reason for this
          difference is currently unknown. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> may speculate that
          RPE cells use this build-in mechanism to defend the
          oxidative stress that they are constantly exposed to. We
          currently have no data to support or dismiss this
          possibility. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2E, some cultures responded to H 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> treatment by a perinuclear
          distribution of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">actin fibers</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2F, we observed
          microspikes at the periphery of the cells. A detailed
          study of microspikes by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adams</ENAMEX> indicated that these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> consist of actin, the actin binding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kd</ENAMEX>/fascin and myosin [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> ] . The perinuclear staining
          and microspikes of cells under oxidative stress in this
          study are very similar to those observed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Huot et</ENAMEX> al.
          in endothelial cells treated with H 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ] . The functional significance
          of these structural changes in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPE</ENAMEX> after H 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> treatment is not clear. There is a
          possibility that the appearance of microspikes around the
          cells under stressed conditions is an adapted behavior of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> in order to attach to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">substratum</ENAMEX> firmly.
          Prolonged H 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> treatment led to cell death with the
          appearance of condensed nuclei is an indication of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apoptosis</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4C,4<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>). This general finding is
          consistent with that observed by others [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8 12</ENAMEX> ] .
          It is of interest to note that cultures with a reduced
          density are more vulnerable to H 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> treatment (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1C). One
          straightforward explanation for the vulnerability of
          low-density cultures treated with H 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2</ENAMEX> is that more molecules of H 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> were present in these
          low-density cultures, which caused a lower viability. If
          this were the case, a mathematic analysis of the H 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> molecules per <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> should be able to
          estimate the cytotoxicity in this experimental system.
          For example, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.4</NUMEX> mM H 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> in a culture plated at a density of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40,000</NUMEX> cells/well should result in a viability close to
          twice of that generated in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20,000</NUMEX> cells/well and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
          times of that in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX> cells/well. Results from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          1Cindicated that the viability of each condition above
          was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">94%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">49% or 11%</NUMEX>, respectively. It is apparent that H 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> killed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more</NUMEX> cells in cultures of
          lower density (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX> cells/well) than expected. Because
          the result could not always be predicted by a mathematic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">estimation</ENAMEX>, there is a possibility that cell-cell
          contacts and some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">autocrine</ENAMEX>/paracrine production in a
          culture may alter the microenvironment thus determine the
          cytotoxicity caused by H 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> . Since cells with lower density are
          more susceptible to oxidative <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX>, there is a
          possibility that a vicious cycle exists such that when an
          area of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPE</ENAMEX> loses some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">constituent</ENAMEX> cells by
          oxidative <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX>, the remaining <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> will become even
          more vulnerable to this insult.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPARs</ENAMEX> in RPE
          This study indicated that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPARÎ³</ENAMEX> agonist <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15d</NUMEX>-PGJ 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2</ENAMEX> could prevent H 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> induced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPE</ENAMEX> cell death (Figs.
          5A,5<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Band Fig</ENAMEX>. 4E). This suggests that this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> can
          prevent <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">oxidative stress induced</ENAMEX> RPE damage. This finding
          is significant given prior reports that oxidative stress
          on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPE</ENAMEX> is an important contributing factor of age-related
          macular degeneration [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5 42</ENAMEX> ] . An earlier report also
          indicated that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPARÎ³</ENAMEX> agonists could prevent laser
          photocoagulation induced choroidal neovascularization in
          rat eyes and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkey</ENAMEX> eyes, which suggests the possible
          application of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> on the exudative form of
          age-related macular degeneration [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX> ] . It is important
          to note that the other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPARÎ³</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agonists</ENAMEX> tested in this
          study (ciglitazone, azelaoyl <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAF</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">LY171883</ENAMEX>) were
          ineffective in saving cells under the same experimental
          conditions. Since <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPARÎ³</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agonists</ENAMEX> tested
          were ineffective, this raises the possibility that the
          saving effect of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15d</NUMEX>-PGJ 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2</ENAMEX> is not through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPARÎ³</ENAMEX> activation. In
          this respect, it should be noted that this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> has been
          shown to exert some biological effects that are
          independent of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPARÎ³</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">activation</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44 45 46</NUMEX> ] .
          We have previously shown that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15d</NUMEX>-PGJ 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> can prevent the cytotoxicity of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol oxides</ENAMEX>, end products of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cholesterol</ENAMEX> under
          oxidative stress [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . Together with results from the
          current study, this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> may have a general protective
          effect against oxidative stress itself or against
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytotoxic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> generated by oxidative <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX>. It is
          important to note that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15d</NUMEX>-PGJ 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> functions as a general inhibitor of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immune</ENAMEX> activities. For example, this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> is a potent
          inhibitor of microglia, the macrophage-like <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> in the
          central nervous system [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47 48 49</NUMEX> ] and shown to be
          effective in reducing the symptoms of experimental
          autoimmune <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">encephalomyelitis</ENAMEX> (EAE), an <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> model for
          the human <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease multiple sclerosis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> ] . Together,
          these results suggest that this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> may be useful in
          preventing ocular <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> that result from oxidative
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX> or inflammation.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERK</ENAMEX> activation and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-HNE <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein adducts</ENAMEX> formation
          as a result of oxidative stress
          Oxidative <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX> is a potent stimulator of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAP</ENAMEX>
          kinase activities [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15 51</NUMEX> ] . Phosphorylation of ERK
          could be observed within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30-60 minutes</TIMEX> after H 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> treatment (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). There are
          conflicting results in literature regarding whether an
          increase of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERK</ENAMEX> phosphorylation is beneficial or
          detrimental to cell survival. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bhat et</ENAMEX> al. demonstrated
          that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5-25 Î¼M PD98059</ENAMEX> could prevent H 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> induced cell death in an
          oligodendrocyte cell line [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . In contrast, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 Î</NUMEX>¼M
          PD98059 was shown to enhance cell death caused by H 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> treatment in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">HeLa</ENAMEX> cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] .
          This reagent had no significant effect on H 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> treated ARPE-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> cells under our
          experimental conditions. AG126, on the other hand,
          appeared to reduce the cytotoxicity caused by oxidative
          stress (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>). While this suggests that inhibition of
          tyrosine phosphorylation or ERK activation after H 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> treatment might be beneficial for
          the cells, results from PD98059 could not support this
          statement.
          There is a possibility that the saving effect of AG126
          is not related to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERK</ENAMEX> inhibition. Under the current
          experimental conditions, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AG126</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> Î¼M was protective
          but it enhanced H 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> toxicity at <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 Î¼M</NUMEX>. These results
          were consistent with those reported by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sagara et al.</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">52</NUMEX>
          ] . AG126 belongs to a group of tyrosine kinase
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">tyrphostins</ENAMEX>. Many of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> can
          prevent cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">oxidative</ENAMEX> stress including that
          generated by glutamate. There is no correlation between
          the kinase inhibition and the observed protective effect.
          Overnight treatment of cells with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AG126</ENAMEX> can increase
          cellular glutathione levels. Furthermore, this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> has
          some anti-oxidant effect based on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trolox Equivalent</ENAMEX>
          Activity Concentration [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">52</TIMEX> ] . Collectively, this may
          explain the observation that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AG126</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> Î¼M could
          partially prevent H 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cytotoxicity</ENAMEX>. This <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> can
          also function as a mitochondria uncoupler, thus it
          actually enhances H 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> cytotoxicity at higher
          concentrations [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">52</TIMEX> ] .
          An accumulation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-HNE-conjugated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> has been
          detected in <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> of aging-related diseases, including
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Parkinson's disease</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53</TIMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Alzheimer's disease</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">54</TIMEX> ]
          . It also accumulates in the affected neuronal tissues of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">experimental animals</ENAMEX> experiencing brain ischemia [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55 56</NUMEX>
          ] and traumatic spinal cord injury [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">57</TIMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HNE</ENAMEX> can
          impair synaptosomal membrane <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, glutamate
          transport and importantly, mitochondrial functions [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">58</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">59</NUMEX> ] . Evidence indicates that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-HNE increases neuronal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">susceptibility</ENAMEX> to oxidative stress [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60</TIMEX> ] and serves as a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediator</ENAMEX> of oxidative stress that leads to neuronal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apoptosis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">61</TIMEX> ] . As indicated in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Introduction</ENAMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HNE</ENAMEX> has been implicated in some ocular pathological
          conditions [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 20</NUMEX> ] .
          Several <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratories</ENAMEX> have attempted to document the
          formation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-HNE <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein adducts</ENAMEX> during oxidative
          stress by Western blot analysis. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Uchida et al.</ENAMEX> first
          reported oxidative stress caused by t-butylhydroperoxide
          or iron/ascorbate could lead to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-HNE <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein adducts</ENAMEX> in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hepatocytes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">62</TIMEX> ] . Further studies by these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX>
          attempted to identify the common epitope recognized by
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-HNE <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX>. However, no specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> was
          positively identified [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">63</TIMEX> ] . More recently, the
          formation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-HNE <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein adducts</ENAMEX> was also demonstrated
          by Western blot analysis from the heart [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">64</TIMEX> ] , the
          liver [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">65</TIMEX> ] and the kidney [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">66</TIMEX> ] under oxidative
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX>. It is important to point out that the patterns of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-HNE <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein adducts</ENAMEX>, as shown by these Western blot
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">analyses</ENAMEX>, were different among these studies, probably as
          a result of tissue specificity. No particular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> was
          identified as a specific target for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-HNE adduct
          formation in these studies. Results from the current
          study indicate that H 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPE</ENAMEX> could lead to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accumulation</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-HNE <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein adducts</ENAMEX> in the cytoplasm
          and the nuclei of these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). There was a
          dose-dependent increase of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-HNE <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein adduct</ENAMEX> after H 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> treatment with a maximal intensity
          of ~7X control at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> mM H 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3C). This may partially
          contribute to oxidative <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress induced ocular disease</ENAMEX>.
          Even though ocular tissues, including the retina, contain
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">glutathione S-transferases</ENAMEX> that can actively detoxify
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4-HNE</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35 67</NUMEX> ] , adverse events may occur if aging or
          pathological conditions hinder this normal defense from
          functioning properly. It warrants further studies to
          identify those <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> species that are modified by
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4-HNE</TIMEX>.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        This study demonstrates that oxidative stress induced by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2</ENAMEX> could lead to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RPE</ENAMEX> cell death, which is
        preceded by distinct morphological changes, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERK</ENAMEX> activation
        and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-HNE <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein adduct</ENAMEX> formation. The cell death can be
        prevented partially by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AG126</TIMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">prostaglandin</ENAMEX>
        derivative, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15d</NUMEX>-PGJ 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> may be useful
        pharmacological tools in the future capable of preventing
        oxidative <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress induced</ENAMEX> RPE cell death in human ocular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX>.
