        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Autoimmunity</ENAMEX> is a well-established mechanism of
        premature ovarian failure. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3 4</NUMEX> ] . It has been
        suggested that the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ovarian antibodies</ENAMEX> may be
        helpful in the diagnosis of ovarian autoimmunity [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6</NUMEX> ] .
        However, presently there is no validated serum marker that
        can establish a diagnosis of autoimmune premature ovarian
        failure with certainty [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . Young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> can experience
        ovarian failure by several mechanisms other than
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">autoimmunity</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . A false positive diagnostic test
        indicating autoimmunity as the mechanism of spontaneous
        premature ovarian failure could put young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> at risk for
        inappropriate therapy. Such therapy could have serious
        consequences, such as the development of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">osteonecrosis</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>
        ]
        Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> with premature ovarian failure have ovarian
        follicles that function intermittently [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 10</ENAMEX> ] . and
        pregnancies have occurred after the diagnosis of premature
        ovarian failure [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12 13 14</NUMEX> ] . Clinicians are in need of
        an accurate method for the diagnosis of autoimmune
        oophoritis, a test with proven sensitivity and specificity
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . Here we conduct an investigation to determine
        whether a commercially available <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ovarian antibody</ENAMEX> test
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Immunodiagnostic Laboratories, Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Leandro</ENAMEX>, CA)
        might be useful in the diagnosis of autoimmune premature
        ovarian failure. We performed the test in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> with
        premature ovarian failure, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> with normal ovarian
        function, and in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>. We found that this commercially
        available test has a high incidence of false positives.
        Therefore, this test would not be expected to be useful in
        the diagnosis of autoimmune <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">premature ovarian failure</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Methods
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Controls</ENAMEX>
          By local advertisement we recruited <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> control women
          with regular menstrual cycles (matched for age and parity
          to our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX> control <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> (matched for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX>).
          The controls were also matched to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">race</ENAMEX>. We
          recruited <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with spontaneous premature ovarian
          failure by letters to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> and notices in medical
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">journals</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Institute of Child Health</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Human Development Institutional Review Board</ENAMEX> approved the
          protocol. We diagnosed premature ovarian failure in women
          who before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the age of 40</TIMEX> had experienced amenorrhea in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> with serum FSH levels greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mIU</ENAMEX>/mL
          (confirmed on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> separate occasions, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least one month</TIMEX>
          apart). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twenty-six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with premature ovarian
          failure participated in this study (median age of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, range <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18-39 years</TIMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> had been diagnosed
          at a median <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age of 30 years</TIMEX> (range <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15-38 years</TIMEX>). The
          median time since diagnosis was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 years</TIMEX> (range <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.33</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>). All <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> had a normal karyotype and had no
          history of chemotherapy or radiation. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">26%</NUMEX>)
          had hypothyroidism, one <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> had <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Addison</ENAMEX> disease, and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> had <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Raynaud</ENAMEX> syndrome.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ovarian Antibodies</ENAMEX>
          We sent blinded specimens to Immunodiagnostic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Laboratories, Inc.</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Leandro</ENAMEX>, CA) to be tested for
          ovarian antibodies using an indirect immunofluorescence
          test system supplied by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scimedx Inc.</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Denville</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NJ</ENAMEX>). The
          kit includes frozen sections of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cynomologous monkey</ENAMEX> ovary
          as tissue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">substrate</ENAMEX>, a positive control of human serum
          known to contain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> against the zona pellucida, a
          negative control serum, and fluorescein isothiocyanate
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FITC</ENAMEX>) conjugated goat <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> against human
          immunoglobulins including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IgG, IgM</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IgA</ENAMEX>. Binding of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> to the zona pellucida at a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1:10</TIMEX> dilution was
          reported by the laboratory on a scale of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0 to 3</NUMEX>+
          according to the intensity of fluorescence: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">0</ENAMEX>, negative;
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>+, weak; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+ moderate or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>+ strong fluorescence (Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
          We also tested serum in our own laboratory using this
          same test system (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scimedx, Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Denville</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NJ</ENAMEX>). Aliquoted
          serum samples of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and controls were stored at
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">-80°C.</ENAMEX> After thawing at room temperature, serum samples
          were diluted <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1:10</TIMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>. We confirmed the adequacy of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">monkey ovary</ENAMEX> sections from individual <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lots</ENAMEX> in an
          unblinded manner before using them. For each experiment
          slides of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkey ovary</ENAMEX> with the same lot number were
          allowed to equilibrate to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> temperature. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Twenty</TIMEX>
          microliters of blinded sample were applied to the tissue
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">substrate</ENAMEX> slides. A slide containing positive and
          negative controls was run unblinded with each experiment.
          Slides were placed into a moist covered <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chamber</ENAMEX> and
          incubated for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 minutes</TIMEX> at room temperature. Next, the
          slides were washed in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three 10-minute</TIMEX> soaks.
          After blotting the slides, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> uL of FITC-conjugated goat
          antibodies against human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">immunoglobulins</ENAMEX> was delivered to
          each sample and slides were again incubated in the moist
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chamber</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 minutes</TIMEX>. The washings and blotting were
          repeated as above. Mounting medium and a coverslip were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">applied</ENAMEX>. The slides were kept in a dark moist chamber
          until evaluated using a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zeiss Axiophot</ENAMEX> Fluorescent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Microscope</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carl Zeiss</ENAMEX> Inc., <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Thornwood</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NY</ENAMEX>) at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40×</NUMEX>
          magnification with emission at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</NUMEX> nM and excitation at
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">520-560 nM.</TIMEX> We graded fluorescence of the zona pellucida
          on the same <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0 to 3</NUMEX>+ scale as noted above.
        
        
          Reproducibility
          To evaluate the reproducibility of the test we
          selected <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> samples previously determined by
          this technique to be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>+, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>+ for zona pellucida
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX>. In a blinded manner, we tested each sample <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>
          times (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> tests each on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> separate <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>).
        
        
          Other Autoantibodies
          Antinuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANA</ENAMEX>) titer was determined by
          indirect immunofluorescence using <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hep-2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">substrate</ENAMEX>.
          Rheumatoid factor was determined by latex agglutination.
          Antiparietal cell <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> were measured by indirect
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunofluorescence</ENAMEX> using rat stomach (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smith Kline Beecham</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinical Laboratories</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Van Nuys</ENAMEX>, CA). Antithyroid
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">peroxidase</ENAMEX> (anti-TPO) binding activity was determined by
          a radiobinding assay using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Iodine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">125labelled</ENAMEX> human
          recombinant thyroid peroxidase (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nichols Institute</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Juan Capistano</ENAMEX>, CA).
        
        
          Statistics
          We used the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fischer</ENAMEX> exact test, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">chi-square</NUMEX>, and the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spearman</ENAMEX> rank correlation test as appropriate. We used
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>-tailed tests to look for an increase in autoantibody
          as compared to controls and we set 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 0.05</ENAMEX> as significant.
          Statistical analysis was performed using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma Stat</ENAMEX>
          Software (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jandel Scientific</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Rafael</ENAMEX>, CA).
        
      
      
        Results
        
          Ovarian antibodies
          
            By commercial laboratory
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Eight</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX> control <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">31%</NUMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX> women
            with spontaneous premature ovarian failure (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX>) had
            ovarian <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> as detected by the commercial
            laboratory (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). The frequencies were not
            significantly different ( 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.26</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">chi-square</NUMEX> test).
          
          
            By our own laboratory
            When we evaluated these same <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> for ovarian
            antibodies in our own <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX> we obtained similar
            results. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twelve</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">46%</NUMEX>) with premature
            ovarian failure had ovarian <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> versus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">38%</NUMEX>) ( 
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.78</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">chi-square</NUMEX> test; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
          
        
        
          Reproducibility
          We could not reliably reproduce the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> categories of
          ovarian <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> test grading. Although our results
          correlated with the known graded samples (r = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.72</NUMEX>, 
          P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>), the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>+ readings were
          reproduced in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 8</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> tests (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">53%</NUMEX>) and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+
          readings were reproduced in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 2</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> tests (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13%</NUMEX>)
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). In contrast, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0 and 3</NUMEX>+ readings were
          reproduced in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">87%</NUMEX>) and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX>) of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> respective
          tests (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          Efforts to improve the test
          Because the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>+ and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+ readings had poor
          reproducibility, we were concerned that this inaccuracy
          might have impaired our ability to detect a difference
          between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and control <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. We therefore
          redefined the outcome measure to be read simply as
          positive (+) or negative (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">-</ENAMEX>). Positive was defined as the
          presence of homogeneous fluorescence on the zona
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pellucida</ENAMEX> above background and negative was defined as
          any fluorescence less than this. Tests were then repeated
          using serum from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX> control <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. We
          were unable to demonstrate a significant difference using
          the revised outcome measure. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patient serum</ENAMEX> was positive
          in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">54%</NUMEX>) and control serum was positive
          in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">42%</NUMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). When we tested the
          sera on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> separate occasions with this method, we
          found <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> sera (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35%</NUMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> control sera (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">23%</NUMEX>) to be
          consistently positive for zona pellucida <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.38</NUMEX>).
          We were unable to improve the test by using higher
          dilutions of serum (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1:20</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1:40</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1:80</TIMEX>). All <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX> controls were negative for ovarian
          antibodies at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1:20</TIMEX>. The positive control sample was
          positive at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1:40</TIMEX> and negative at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1:80</TIMEX>.
        
        
          Specificity
          To evaluate the specificity of the test we compared
          sera from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX> normal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> with sera from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX> normal men
          matched for age. The tests were performed at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1:10</TIMEX>
          dilution using the positive and negative outcome measure
          as discussed above. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Women</ENAMEX> were significantly more likely
          to have ovarian <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Eleven</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">26 normal</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">42%</NUMEX>) had ovarian antibodies whereas none of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX>
          normal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> had these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> ( 
          P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.001</NUMEX>). These findings were
          confirmed in a separate experiment (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9/26</NUMEX> versus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0/26</NUMEX>, 
          P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.002</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Other Auto-antibodies
          Results of other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> tests are shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Women</ENAMEX> with spontaneous premature ovarian failure were
          significantly more likely than control <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> to have
          parietal cell <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 0.05</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fischer</ENAMEX>'s exact test)
          and thyroid peroxidase <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 0.05</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fischer</ENAMEX>'s exact
          test).
        
      
      
        Discussion
        There is evidence to suggest that some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
        spontaneous premature ovarian may have clinically
        significant circulating ovarian <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX>. In a seminal
        study reported in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1979</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coulam</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ryan</ENAMEX> demonstrated that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with premature ovarian failure, as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, have
        ovarian antibodies present in their sera as determined by
        immunoprecipitation of radiolabeled human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ovarian proteins</ENAMEX>
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . However, the identity of these specific ovarian
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">antigen</ENAMEX>(s) remains unknown. It should pointed out, however,
        that immunoblotting studies have failed to reveal a
        consistent pattern of binding using the sera of patients
        with premature ovarian failure [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Presently</ENAMEX>, there is no proven sensitive and specific
        serum test to confirm that a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> has ovarian failure on
        an autoimmune basis [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . Histologic evaluation of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ovary</ENAMEX> is the only way to diagnose autoimmune oophoritis
        with certainty [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . Nonetheless, some clinicians
        currently use commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ovarian antibody</ENAMEX> tests for the
        diagnosis of autoimmune <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">premature ovarian failure</ENAMEX> and make
        treatment recommendations based on these findings. This
        approach can have severe adverse consequences such as the
        development of osteonecrosis related to glucocorticoid
        therapy [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . Here we demonstrate that detection of
        ovarian <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> by indirect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">immunofluorescence</ENAMEX> using one
        specific commercial test system has poor specificity as a
        diagnostic test. The test is positive in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly one-third</NUMEX>
        of normal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. Therefore, the test is not a useful
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">diagnostic marker</ENAMEX> of autoimmune premature ovarian
        failure.
        We found that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> with premature ovarian failure are
        significantly more likely to have positive thyroid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">peroxidase</ENAMEX> and parietal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> autoantibodies than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> with
        normal ovarian function. In this regard our findings are in
        agreement with previous studies [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 19 20</NUMEX> ] . In contrast
        to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> previous study, however [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] , we did not find a
        significantly higher prevalence of antinuclear antibodies
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> with premature ovarian failure.
        Because little is known about the pathophysiology of
        human autoimmune <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">oophoritis</ENAMEX>, experimental animal models
        have been used to gain insight into possible mechanisms [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 23</NUMEX> ] . The fact that we found an increased frequency of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">thyroid</ENAMEX> and gastric parietal cell antibodies in our
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> suggests similarity to a model of autoimmune
        ovarian failure that can be induced in certain strains of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> by performing neonatal thymectomy. These <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> also
        develop autoimmunity against thyroid and gastric parietal
        cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . It is well established that these <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> with
        ovarian autoimmunity also develop circulating
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">autoantibodies</ENAMEX> against the oocyte cytoplasm, the zona
        pellucida, and against steroid producing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] .
        While we found evidence that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one half</NUMEX> of our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> had
        specific antibodies directed against the zona pellucida, we
        did not find any consistent pattern of immunofluorescence
        to suggest that our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> had antibodies directed
        against the oocyte cytoplasm or the steroid producing cells
        of the ovary. It is noteworthy that immune serum from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>
        with ovarian autoimmunity reacts specifically with an
        oocyte-specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MATER</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 25</NUMEX> ] . We have
        subsequently identified the homologous human 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MATER gene</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] In
        ongoing work we are evaluating the value of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MATER</ENAMEX>
        antibodies as a marker for autoimmune <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ovarian failure</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>.
        The fact that we did not detect ovarian antibodies
        binding to the zona pellucida in any of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> <
        <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.001</NUMEX>) is intriguing. This finding supports proposals that
        pre-B cells undergo positive selection directed by the
        presence of surface heavy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX> with low albeit sufficient
        affinity to the autoantigen. It appears then, that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX>,
        lacking the specific ovarian self-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX>, fail to provide
        positive selection for these pre-B cells clones. Also, this
        finding suggests that the detection system is specific for
        zona pellucida, and that further refinement of the assay
        system by using pure human recombinant zona pellucida
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> might be useful. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sacco</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moghissi</ENAMEX> detected zona
        pellucida <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> in both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> by indirect
        immunofluorescence, but they used porcine rather than
        primate zonae pellicidae [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . Normal animal and human
        serum are known to contain a wide range of low-titer
        autoantibodies that have been termed "natural
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">autoantibodies</ENAMEX>" [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] . Even B cells from newborn <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> and
        human cord blood produce these natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">autoantibodies</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30 31</NUMEX> ] . The low titer ovarian <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> that we
        demonstrate here in the serum of normal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> are likely
        natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">autoantibodies</ENAMEX>, and not antibodies with any
        pathophysiologic significance.
        Identifying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> with autoimmune premature ovarian
        failure presents the opportunity to restore ovarian
        function by proper immune modulation therapy. However, at
        present we don't really know how many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> with premature
        ovarian failure develop it due to autoimmunity. Currently,
        ovarian biopsy is the only way to diagnose autoimmune
        premature ovarian failure with certainty. However, because
        there is no treatment proven safe and effective to restore
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fertility</ENAMEX>, in our view, ovarian biopsy is not indicated
        outside a controlled trial [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] .
      
      
        Conclusions
        We found that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately one-third</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> with
        normal ovarian function have ovarian autoantibodies
        detected by indirect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">immunofluorescence</ENAMEX> using <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkey</ENAMEX> ovary
        as substrate. Hence, this ovarian <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> test as
        presently performed has poor specificity, and therefore
        appears to have no benefit in the evaluation and management
        of autoimmune <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">premature ovarian failure</ENAMEX>. The specificity of
        any <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ovarian antibody</ENAMEX> test should be established before it
        is used clinically.
