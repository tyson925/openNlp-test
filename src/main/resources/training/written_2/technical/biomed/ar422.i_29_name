        The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Golgi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> is an elaborate cytoplasmic organelle
        that has a prominent function in the processing,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">transporting</ENAMEX>, and sorting of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">intracellular proteins</ENAMEX>.
        Autoantibodies directed against the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Golgi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> were
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> identified in the serum of a <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">SjÃ¶gren's syndrome</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> with lymphoma [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . Subsequent reports described
        anti-Golgi <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> autoantibodies (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AGA</ENAMEX>) in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">systemic rheumatic diseases</ENAMEX> such as systemic lupus
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">erythematosus</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] , <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">rheumatoid arthritis</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] , and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wegener</ENAMEX>'s granulomatosis [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Immunoblotting</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunoprecipitation</ENAMEX> studies have shown that there was
        heterogeneity of reactivity among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AGA</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] .
        Within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past several years</TIMEX>, our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratories</ENAMEX> and
        others have cloned and identified novel Golgi autoantigens
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">golgins</NUMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . This has been achieved primarily by
        expression cloning using human autoantibody probes. The
        identified autoantigens referred to are golgin-160/GCP170 [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8</NUMEX> ] , golgin-95/gm130 [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] , golgin-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">97</NUMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] ,
        golgin-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">245/</NUMEX> p230 [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11 12</NUMEX> ] , <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">giantin/macrogolgin/</ENAMEX>GCP372
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14</NUMEX> ] , and golgin-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">67</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . These <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are
        characterized by predominant Î±-helical coiled-coil domains,
        except for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-termini and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>termini. It has been reported
        that some golgins are localized to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cytoplasmic</ENAMEX> face of
        Golgi membranes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . Functions of the golgins have been
        proposed in vesicular transport and in maintaining
        structural integrity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Golgi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18 19</NUMEX> ] .
        The potential implication is that these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Golgi proteins</ENAMEX> may
        have common biochemical characteristics that may make them
        targets of autoimmune responses in certain disease
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>.
        It is not clear why and how the immune system is able to
        recognize or target intracellular autoantigens. One
        possible explanation is that they may be recognized as
        surface structures on cytoplasmic organelles that are
        released to the immune system in aberrant disease states
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with unregulated cell death (apoptosis or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">necrosis</ENAMEX>) resulting from injury or infection, or defective
        clearance of dying cells. A variety of autoantigens are
        cleaved into signature fragments during apoptosis and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">necrosis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . Other cell death post-translational
        modifications in autoantigens include hyperphosphorylation,
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">de</ENAMEX>)ubiquitination, methylation, citrullination, and
        transglutaminase crosslinking [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 22</NUMEX> ] .
        The emerging view is that modified forms of autoantigens
        generated during cell death might stimulate autoantibody
        responses if presented to the immune system in a
        proinflammatory context [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . Since the fate of the
        Golgi <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> during cell death has not been extensively
        explored, we investigated whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Golgi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> autoantigens are altered during apoptosis and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">necrosis</ENAMEX>. Using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AGA</ENAMEX> as probes, we observed that the Golgi
        complex undergoes dynamic changes during apoptosis distinct
        from those observed in necrosis. Immunoblotting analysis
        showed distinct cleavage fragments of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golgi</ENAMEX> autoantigens
        generated during apoptosis and necrosis. Since the cleaved
        Golgi autoantigen fragments are antigenic, they may play a
        role in sustaining autoantibody production in autoimmune
        disease <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Materials and methods
        
          Antibodies
          Human prototype serum containing highly specific
          antipolyADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AGA</ENAMEX>
          sera were obtained from the serum <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">bank</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WM Keck</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Autoimmune Center</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Scripps Research Institute</ENAMEX>, CA,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Rabbit antibodies</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golgi</ENAMEX> autoantigens were
          produced in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Zealand</ENAMEX> White <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">rabbits</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 9 10</NUMEX> ] .
          Briefly, recombinant human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Golgi autoantigens</ENAMEX> were
          produced using the expression plasmid <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pET28</ENAMEX> system in 
          Escherichia <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coli</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Novagen</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madison</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WI</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Recombinant</ENAMEX> golgin-160 (amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">787-1348,</ENAMEX>

          and golgin-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">97</NUMEX> (amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1-767</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX> accession
          number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">AAB81549</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> were purified by affinity
          nickel column chromatography. They were then used to
          immunize <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one or two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">rabbits</ENAMEX> separately by subcutaneous
          injection of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">recombinant proteins</ENAMEX> in an equal volume of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Freund</ENAMEX>'s complete adjuvant. After booster immunizations,
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">immune sera</ENAMEX> were prepared and stored at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-20Â°C</TIMEX>. The
          appearance and titers of antibodies were monitored by
          indirect immunofluorescence and immunoblotting
          analysis.
        
        
          Induction of cell death
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Human Jurkat</ENAMEX> and HEp-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> cells were obtained from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Type Culture</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Collection</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockville</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MD</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>) and
          were cultured in RPMI <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1640</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dulbecco</ENAMEX>'s modified
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eagle</ENAMEX>'s medium (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Life Technologies</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rockville</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MD</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>),
          respectively, containing <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> fetal bovine serum under
          standard conditions. Induction of cell death was
          performed essentially as described elsewhere [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] with
          some modifications.
          Apoptosis was induced in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jurkat T</ENAMEX> cells (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> 6/ml) by
          exposure to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> Î¼M staurosporine (STS) (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALEXIS</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego</ENAMEX>,
          CA, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>) for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">up to 4 hours</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apoptosis</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HEp-2 cells</ENAMEX> was
          induced by exposure to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> Î¼M STS at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37Â°C</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">up to 6</TIMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX>. Necrosis was induced in these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> by exposure to
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î¼M</NUMEX> STS for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">up to 24 hours</TIMEX> or by treatment with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.1%</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hydrogen peroxide</ENAMEX> (H 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ) (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fisher Scientific</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>) for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3 hours</TIMEX>. Necrosis was quantified using the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">trypan</ENAMEX> blue exclusion assay, which measures loss of
          cytoplasmic membrane integrity, as described previously [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 24</NUMEX> ] .
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">At least 300</NUMEX> cells were counted in triplicate in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three</TIMEX>
          independent experiments. In some experiments, Jurkat
          cells were incubated for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 hour</TIMEX> in the presence of the
          pancaspase inhibitor
          benzylocarbonyl-Val-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ala</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Asp-fluromethyl-ketone</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">zVAD-fmk</NUMEX>)
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ALEXIS</ENAMEX>), used at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> Î¼M, prior to addition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STS</ENAMEX>.
          Treated and control cells, and their extracts, were
          analyzed by indirect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">immunofluorescence</ENAMEX> and/or
          immunoblotting analysis. Spontaneous cell death prior to
          the experiments was minimized by maintaining exponential
          cell growth. Cell viability was quantified by trypan blue
          exclusion analysis at the beginning of every experiment
          to ensure that cell cultures used in the experiments were
          healthy (alive cells ><NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy
          Indirect immunofluorescence was performed as reported
          previously [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7 10 25</ENAMEX> ] . HEp-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> cells were grown on
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX>-chamber vessel tissue culture slides (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Becton</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dickinson</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Franklin Lakes</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NJ</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>) and treated with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> or
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î¼M</NUMEX> STS for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">up to 6 hours</TIMEX>. Cells were fixed by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methanol</ENAMEX>
          and acetone (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1:3, -20Â°C</ENAMEX>) for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> min. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Sera</ENAMEX> containing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AGA</ENAMEX>
          were used in dilutions of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1:200 to 1:10,000</TIMEX>. The
          secondary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> were <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Alexaâ„¢ 488</NUMEX> conjugated goat
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">anti-rabbit IgG</ENAMEX> or anti-human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IgG reagents</ENAMEX> (ALEXIS).
          Cells were counterstained with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4</ENAMEX>'<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole</NUMEX> nuclear stain prior to
          immunofluorescence microscopy. The estimation of the
          percentage of cells at each morphological stage described
          in the following for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golgi</ENAMEX> staining in apoptotic cells
          was obtained by scoring <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> cells in each
          experiment.
        
        
          Immunoblotting analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> lysates
          After incubation in the presence of
          cell-death-inducing reagents, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jurkat</ENAMEX> cells were
          centrifuged at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> Ã— 
          g for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 min</TIMEX>, followed by one wash
          at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1000</TIMEX> Ã— 
          g for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 min</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> containing
          Complete <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Protease</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Inhibitor</ENAMEX> cocktail (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roche, Mannheim</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>). Cell <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pellets</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 7</NUMEX>) were then resuspended
          directly in lysis buffer containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">150</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">NaCl</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> mM

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NP</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX>.
          The lysates were passed several times sequentially
          through <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>-gauge to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX>-gauge needles to shear the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>,
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> concentrations in the lysates were determined
          by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Protein</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DC Assay Kit</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bio-Rad</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hercules</ENAMEX>, CA, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>) to
          ensure equal loading of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX>-PAGE <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lane</ENAMEX>.
          After determination of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> concentration, lysates
          were mixed with an equal volume of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 Ã—</NUMEX> gel sample buffer
          containing <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6%</NUMEX> sodium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dodecyl sulfate</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> glycerol, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX>

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Protease Inhibitor</ENAMEX> cocktail. Lysates were stored at -80Â°C
          until use.
          The equivalent of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1.5 Î</NUMEX>¼g total lysate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> was
          loaded onto each <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lane</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDS</ENAMEX>-PAGE gels, separated by
          electrophoresis, and transferred to nitrocellulose
          membranes using a <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Semi-Dry Trans-Blot</ENAMEX> apparatus
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bio-Rad</ENAMEX>). Immunoblotting was performed as described
          previously [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7 10 24</ENAMEX> ] using human anti-PARP specific

          cells
          HEp-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> cells exposed to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 and 10</NUMEX> Î¼M STS exhibited
          apoptotic-like fragmentation into multiple round bodies
          after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">6 hours</TIMEX> of treatment (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1c,1d). Interestingly,
          cells exposed to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î</NUMEX>¼M <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STS</ENAMEX> showed a more pronounced loss
          of cytoplasmic membrane integrity (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1e), indicating
          that this STS concentration drove cell death more rapidly
          into necrosis. As control, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> treated with levels of H

          Changes in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Golgi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> during apoptosis were
          examined by immunostaining with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AGA</ENAMEX> in HEp-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> cells
          treated with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 Î</NUMEX>¼M <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STS</ENAMEX>. Apoptosis was defined by
          stereotypic morphological changes, especially evident in
          the nucleus, where the chromatin condenses and compacts,
          and assumes a globular, crescent-shaped morphology [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ]
          . Figure 2shows a composite of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> apoptotic stages,

          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> of incubation in the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STS</ENAMEX>, as evidenced
          by perinuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golgi</ENAMEX> staining identical to untreated
          cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2a). Interestingly, 'swelling' of the Golgi
          complex with vesicular staining (stage I) was observed in
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10-20%</NUMEX> of cells, and is most strikingly demonstrated in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2b. It is estimated that the area occupied by the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">swelled Golgi</ENAMEX> can be ~ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5-10</NUMEX> times the normal size for
          Golgi <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> in HEp-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> cells. Slight changes in the shape
          of some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nuclei</ENAMEX> were observed, as shown in the middle
          panel, but most cells with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golgi</ENAMEX> swelling exhibited no
          change in nuclear size and shape.
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">About 10%</NUMEX> of cells appeared to be in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">stage II</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          2c) where there was elongation of the nucleus, appearing
          kidney or crescent shaped (middle <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>). A
          characteristic of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">stage II</ENAMEX> was that the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Golgi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> was
          condensed at the concave or indented region of the
          crescentic nucleus (right <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stage III</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2d) was
          seen in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> of cells with defined nuclear fragmentation
          into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two approximately</NUMEX> equal fragments (middle <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>) and
          golgin-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">97</NUMEX> primarily located at the cleavage zone between
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> nuclear fragments (right <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">About 10-15%</NUMEX> of
          the cells were considered to be at stage <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">IV</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2e),
          where their nuclei were fragmented into <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">more than two</TIMEX>
          pieces (middle <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>) and golgin-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">97</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staining</ENAMEX> appeared as
          vesicular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX>. This was the final stage when
          remnants of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Golgi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> could be detected.
          Evaluation of cells after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">6 hours</TIMEX> of incubation with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Î¼M STS</ENAMEX> showed all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> stages described (data not shown).
          At this time, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">up to 50%</NUMEX> of cells were in stage I, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX>
          were in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">stage II</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3%</NUMEX> were in stage III, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX> of
          cells were in stage <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IV</ENAMEX>. These data suggested that
          STS-treated cells do not enter the apoptotic pathway at
          the same time, which is consistent with the notion that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apoptosis</ENAMEX> is a relatively asynchronous process.
          Similar staining patterns to those seen with golgin-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">97</NUMEX>
          were observed when apoptotic HEp-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> cells were stained
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> to golgin-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">95</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">golgin-160</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">golgin-245</ENAMEX>, and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">giantin</ENAMEX> (data not shown). These results were also
          reproduced in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HeLa</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">S3</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> J774A<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.1</NUMEX> cells treated
          with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 Î¼M</NUMEX> STS (data not shown). The amount of Golgi
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">swelling</ENAMEX> observed in stage I varied in different
          experiments, but the characteristics for stages <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II-IV</ENAMEX>
          were highly reproducible in all the experiments we have
          conducted. Our observations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golgi</ENAMEX> swelling during
          apoptosis are supported by previous studies. For
          instance, in neurons undergoing apoptosis, morphologic
          changes were characterized by a highly ordered sequence
          of organelle abnormalities, with swelling of endoplasmic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reticulum</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golgi</ENAMEX> vesiculation that preceded most
          nuclear changes or mitochondrial disruption [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27 28</NUMEX> ]
          .
        
        
          Changes of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Golgi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> during necrosis
          In contrast to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golgi</ENAMEX> swelling already described,
          striking fragmentation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Golgi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> was observed
          during necrosis in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HEp-2 cells</ENAMEX> treated with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î¼M</NUMEX> STS
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2f). As shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1b,1e, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 50%</NUMEX> of
          cells treated with this STS concentration, while
          initially showing apoptotic-like fragmentation into
          multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX>, gradually died by necrosis. Figure
          2fshows Golgi fragments clearly visible (arrows) in cells
          with condensed nuclei after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">6 hours</TIMEX> of treatment with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Î¼M STS</ENAMEX>. Note the absence of nuclear fragmentation in
          these cells compared with apoptotic cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2e),
          consistent with previous observations showing that
          necrotic nuclei exhibit condensation but not
          fragmentation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . In this treatment, designed to
          drive apoptotic cells more rapidly into necrosis, changes
          in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Golgi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> similar to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> stages observed
          in apoptosis were not detected. Similar results were also
          obtained for other <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Golgi</ENAMEX> autoantigens, including
          golgin-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">160</NUMEX>, giantin, and golgin-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">95</NUMEX> (data not shown).
          No <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Golgi</ENAMEX> staining was observed in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HEp-2 cells</ENAMEX> treated
          with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Î¼M</NUMEX> STS for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX> or with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.1%</NUMEX> H 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (data not shown), presumably due to
          the extensive cytoplasmic damage associated with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">necrosis</ENAMEX>. These results suggested that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golgi</ENAMEX> complex
          is affected differently in apoptosis and in necrosis,
          prompting us to examine whether specific Golgi proteins
          are targeted for proteolysis in these modes of cell
          death.
        
        
          Golgi autoantigens are cleaved during apoptosis and
          necrosis
          It is well established that specific intracellular
          autoantigens are cleaved into different fragments in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jurkat T</ENAMEX> cells and other cell types undergoing apoptosis
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">necrosis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . Mancini 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . reported that golgin-160
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">native protein</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">160</NUMEX> kDa) was cleaved into a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">140</NUMEX> kDa
          fragment during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">apoptosis</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] . We therefore performed
          an immunoblotting analysis using extracts from Jurkat
          cells treated with apoptosis-inducing reagent (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 Î¼M STS</ENAMEX>)
          or necrosis-inducing reagent (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.1%</NUMEX> H 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ) to investigate whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Golgi</ENAMEX>
          autoantigens are cleaved in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> major types of cell
          death. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PARP</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">110</NUMEX> kDa <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>) was selected as a positive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> to monitor the cleavage of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> during
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apoptosis</ENAMEX> and necrosis because its cleavage products in
          Jurkat cells undergoing apoptosis (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">89 kDa</NUMEX>) and undergoing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">necrosis</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">60 and 50 kDa</NUMEX>) are well established [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 24 30</NUMEX>
          ] .
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3shows</NUMEX> the results of immunoblotting analysis
          using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PARP</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Golgi</ENAMEX> autoantigens. In
          cells treated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STS</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, left) or H 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, right), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PARP</ENAMEX> was cleaved
          into an <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">89 kDa polypeptide</NUMEX> (apoptotic fragments) or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX>
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> kDa polypeptides (necrotic fragments),
          respectively, with complete degradation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">native protein</ENAMEX>
          as previously described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] . Golgin-160 was cleaved
          into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">140 and 80</NUMEX> kDa fragments in apoptotic cells,
          consistent with published observations [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] . In
          contrast to the apoptotic fragments, a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX> kDa fragment
          was detected in necrotic cells. Giantin was cleaved into
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> major apoptotic fragments (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">150</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">80</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">60 kDa</NUMEX>),
          and these fragments were clearly different from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">75</NUMEX>
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> kDa fragments derived from necrosis.
          Interestingly, while apoptotic fragments of golgin-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">95</NUMEX> and
          golgin-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">97</NUMEX> were not detected, necrotic fragments at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> and
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">70 kDa</TIMEX> were detected for both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. A summary of the
          Golgi <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> fragments generated during apoptosis and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">necrosis</ENAMEX> is presented in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Proteolysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golgi</ENAMEX> autoantigens induced by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apoptosis</ENAMEX> is caspase dependent
          The caspase <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of proteases plays a central role
          in apoptosis by participating in a cascade of cleavage
          events that result in the apoptotic phenotype [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] . We
          investigated whether the proteolysis of Golgi
          autoantigens caused by treatment with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STS</ENAMEX> was caspase
          dependent. Jurkat cells were treated with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 Î¼M</NUMEX> STS for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> after preincubation with the pan-caspase inhibitor
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">100 Î¼M</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">zVAD-fmk</ENAMEX>. The generation of proteolytic fragments
          from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golgi</ENAMEX> autoantigens was completely blocked in Jurkat
          cells pretreated with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">zVAD-fmk</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>), indicating that
          cleavage of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golgi</ENAMEX> autoantigens during apoptosis is
          mediated by caspases.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apoptotic</ENAMEX> changes of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golgi</ENAMEX> complex
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lane</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . reported recently that the
          Golgi <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">HeLa</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> is fragmented into scattered
          vesicles by caspases due to interference of Golgi
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reassembly</ENAMEX> and abnormalities of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">65</NUMEX> kDa stacking
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein GRASP65</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] . In the present report, we
          describe characteristic changes of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golgi</ENAMEX> complex
          during the progression of apoptosis. It is not known
          whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Golgi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> functions as a <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX> sensor
          involved in the regulation of apoptosis. Mancini 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . reported that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">caspase-2</ENAMEX> was
          localized at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Golgi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> and generated a unique
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cleavage</ENAMEX> product of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">golgin-160</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] . Furthermore,
          these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> proposed that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golgi</ENAMEX> complex
          transduces proapoptotic signals [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] . A precedent for
          this hypothesis was provided by Nakagawa 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al .</ENAMEX>, who reported that
          caspase-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and
          mediates an endoplasmic reticulum-specific apoptosis
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathway</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] . In the present study, we have found that
          all <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Golgi</ENAMEX> autoantigens examined were cleaved in apoptosis
          in a caspase-dependent manner, as evidenced by studies
          showing that the pan-caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk
          completely blocked the apoptotic fragmentation of these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antigens</ENAMEX>. Although the requirement for specific caspases
          was not examined here, it is possible that caspases
          localized in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Golgi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> (including caspase-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>)
          transduce death signals during the early stages of
          apoptosis that are associated with fragmentation of
          specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Golgi proteins</ENAMEX>.
          It has been reported that apoptotic death receptors
          such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD95</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] , tumor necrosis factor-related
          apoptosis inducing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ligand receptor 1</ENAMEX>, tumor necrosis
          factor-related apoptosis inducing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ligand receptor 2</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX>
          ] , and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor necrosis</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor receptor 1</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] are
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enriched</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Golgi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> prior to transport to the
          plasma membrane, thus suggesting that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golgi</ENAMEX> complex
          may play an important role in apoptotic signalling. We
          now provide evidence for characteristic alterations in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Golgi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> corresponding to nuclear change during
          the progression of apoptosis. Swelling of the Golgi
          complex was particularly detected in the early stages of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apoptosis</ENAMEX>. It could be speculated that apoptotic
          alterations of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Golgi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> may facilitate the
          transportation of death <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golgi</ENAMEX> complex
          to the plasma membrane, and may amplify the apoptotic
          events once apoptosis was initiated. Additional studies
          are needed to examine the precise function of the Golgi
          complex during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">apoptosis</TIMEX>.
        
        
          Role of apoptotic or necrotic fragments in
          autoantibody production
          Analysis of post-<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">translational</ENAMEX> modifications in
          intracellular autoantigens associated with apoptosis and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">necrosis</ENAMEX> should provide important insights into the
          possible role of cell death in the generation of
          potentially autoantigenic forms of cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">antigens</ENAMEX>.
          Casciola-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rosen</ENAMEX> and coworkers have proposed that
          modifications of autoantigens during cell death,
          particularly proteolytic cleavage, might be crucial for
          the generation of autoantibodies in autoimmune <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 37</NUMEX> ] . Unique proteolytic fragments of Î±-fodrin and
          type <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> muscarinic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acetylcholine receptor</ENAMEX> have been
          implicated in the generation of autoantibody responses in
          primary <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">SjÃ¶gren's syndrome</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38 39</NUMEX> ] .
          Although direct evidence that autoantigen cleavage
          fragments produced during cell death elicit autoantibody
          responses is still scarce, Pollard 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . reported that immunization
          of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">B10</TIMEX>.<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">S mice</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H-2</ENAMEX> s) with a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> kDa proteolytic cleavage
          fragment of fibrillarin (derived from nonapoptotic cell
          death) elicited <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> that are comparable with human
          anti-fibrillarin autoantibodies and those derived from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> exposed to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mercury</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> ] . In a study using human
          sera, Greidinger 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . reported that the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">recognition</ENAMEX> of apoptosis-derived and oxidatively modified
          forms of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX> kDa subunit of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">U1</NUMEX> small nuclear
          ribonucleoprotein autoantigen was associated with
          distinct disease manifestations [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ] . Furthermore,

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . demonstrated that a
          combination of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen-</ENAMEX>processing <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> and a fragment of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> topoisomerase I efficiently elicited autoreactive
          T-cell proliferation, whereas the full-length
          topoisomerase I required additional stimulus of exogenous
          interleukin-2 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ] .
          These data point to a crucial role for fragments of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">autoantigens</ENAMEX> in the generation of autoantibody responses.
          In the present study, several <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Golgi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">autoantigens</ENAMEX> were
          detected cleaved into distinctive fragments during
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apoptosis</ENAMEX> and necrosis. It has been speculated that these
          modified forms of autoantigens may have enhanced
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunogenicity</ENAMEX> through exposure of immunocryptic epitopes
          that are not generated during <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> processing [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 23</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37 43</NUMEX> ] . These epitopes could trigger autoimmune
          responses if presented to the immune system under
          proinflammatory conditions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> ] , and they may be
          recognized as surface structures on cytoplasmic
          organelles that are released to the immune system in
          aberrant disease <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Autoantibody</ENAMEX> responses could be amplified and
          maintained on repeated stimulation if the exposure of
          intracellular antigens to the immune system is associated
          with defective clearance of apoptotic cells, prolonged
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">necrosis</ENAMEX> (primary or secondary), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T-cell</ENAMEX> cytotoxicity
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with chronic infection, or even antigen
          mutation or overexpression. It would be important not
          only to assess the immunogenic potential of subcellular
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">particles</ENAMEX> and proteolytic fragments released during cell
          death, but also to continue investigating possible
          defects leading to aberrant apoptosis or phagocyte
          function and/or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aberrant antigen</ENAMEX> expression in systemic
          autoimmune <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Kinetics of degradation of golgins and generation
          of apoptotic fragments
          Although only well-defined apoptotic fragments of
          golgin-160 and giantin, not of golgin-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">95 and golgin</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">97</NUMEX>,
          were detected after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 or 4 hours</TIMEX> of incubation with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STS</ENAMEX>,
          total disappearance of intact <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> was detected with
          all <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Golgi</ENAMEX> autoantigens and complete blockage was observed
          in the presence of z-VAD-fmk. These results suggested
          that there might be differences in the kinetics of
          degradation among the golgins, with golgin-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">95</NUMEX> and
          golgin-97 perhaps being more sensitive to proteolysis and
          being targeted very early during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">apoptosis</TIMEX>. While the
          absence of apoptotic fragments for golgin-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">95</NUMEX> and
          golgin-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">97</NUMEX> suggests that total degradation of these
          proteins occurred without generation of intermediate
          protease-resistant fragments, it cannot be ruled out that
          the intact <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> were released from apoptotic cells or
          that their apoptotic fragments were not recognized by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">autoantibodies</ENAMEX>.
          In the present study, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jurkat</ENAMEX> cells were relatively
          sensitive to the treatment with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">STS</ENAMEX> such that the
          kinetics of degradation of different golgins relative to
          that of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PARP</ENAMEX> could not be accurately differentiated.
          Since HEp-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> cells grown as a monolayer were observed to
          be more resistant to apoptosis compared with Jurkat
          cells, we used <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HEp-2 cells</ENAMEX> to investigate more precisely
          the relative kinetics of degradation for the native
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">golgins</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">apoptosis</TIMEX>.
          An identical pattern of fragmentation was essentially
          observed for all the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golgi</ENAMEX> autoantigens examined except
          that the overall kinetics of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">native protein</ENAMEX> degradation
          was slower (data not shown). The integrity of native
          golgin-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">95 and golgin</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">97</NUMEX>, in which apoptotic fragments
          were not detected, was almost completely maintained at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> after the addition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STS</ENAMEX> (data not shown). In
          contrast, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">native golgin-160</ENAMEX> and giantin were degraded
          into their respective fragments <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12 hours</TIMEX> after the
          addition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">STS</ENAMEX>. The processing of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">golgin-160</ENAMEX> and giantin
          occurred <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">as early as</TIMEX> that for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PARP</ENAMEX>, suggesting that these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are cleaved during the onset of apoptosis (data
          not shown). Cleavage of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">golgin-160</ENAMEX> and giantin may thus
          play a potentially important role in the early stages of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apoptosis</ENAMEX>.
          Although we did not determine which golgins are
          substrates for specific caspases, further studies aimed
          at defining the caspases responsible for golgin cleavage,
          the cleavage sites, and the biological consequences of
          these cleavages should provide important insights into
          the possible role of some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golgi</ENAMEX> autoantigens in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apoptosis</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Conclusion
        The present study has shown overall morphologic changes
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Golgi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> during apoptosis and necrosis, with
        distinct fragmentation patterns of its associated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">autoantigens</ENAMEX>. We propose that cleavage of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">golgin-160</ENAMEX> and
        giantin may play a role in early events in apoptosis. We
        also speculate that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golgi</ENAMEX> fragmentation in cell death might
        participate in sustaining autoantibody response to the
        Golgi <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> in aberrant disease <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> characterized by
        unregulated cell death resulting from injury or infection
        or defective clearance of dying cells.
