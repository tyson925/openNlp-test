        The nicotinic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acetylcholine receptor</ENAMEX> (nAChR) is a
        ligand-gated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ion channel</ENAMEX> that mediates neurotransmission at
        the neuromuscular junction, autonomic ganglia and at some
        sites in the central nervous system. Distinct nAChR
        subtypes exist that can be stimulated by the
        neurotransmitter acetylcholine, the natural product
        nicotine, or by synthetic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">compounds</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nAChR</ENAMEX> is the
        prototype for a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein superfamily</ENAMEX> that includes the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> for the excitatory amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids glutamate</ENAMEX> and
        aspartate, the inhibitory amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acids gamma</ENAMEX>-aminobutyric
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> (GABA) and glycine, as well as the serotonin <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . Like most
        ligand-gated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ion channels</ENAMEX>, nAChRs are homo- or
        hetero-pentameric, each <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">monomer</ENAMEX> belonging to a pull of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">alpha-</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 beta-subunits</NUMEX> (alpha 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2-9</ENAMEX> , beta 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2-4</ENAMEX> ). While each subunit has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
        transmembrane domains, the agonist binding <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> are
        located at the subunit interfaces [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . Both natural and
        synthetic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ligands</ENAMEX> can display varied affinity for different
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor subtypes</ENAMEX>. For instance, nicotine has a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kd</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> nM
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">alpha4-beta2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">nAChR</ENAMEX>, but only <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> Î¼M for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the alpha7-alpha7</TIMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">isoform</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] .
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX>, it has become clear that the neuronal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nAChR</ENAMEX> is a valid target against a variety of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX>,
        including cognitive and attention deficits, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Parkinson's</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, anxiety, and pain <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">management</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4</NUMEX> ] ; the
        addiction liability and other undesirable side-effects of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nicotine</ENAMEX> prohibit the use of this natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">product</ENAMEX> for
        therapeutic applications, but the active development of
        nAChR agonists presenting adequate receptor subtype
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">specificity</ENAMEX> should result in improved pharmacology and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">potency</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . As for most membrane <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, information
        on the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> dimensional structure of the nAChR is limited, and
        the best experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> consists of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.6</NUMEX> A data from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electron</ENAMEX> microscopy [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] , a resolution that does not
        allow for <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX>-based design approaches.
        Recently, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sixma</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> have determined the first
        high-resolution structure of a soluble acetylcholine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">binding protein</ENAMEX> (AChBP), extracted from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">snail neurons</ENAMEX>, and
        homologous to the ligand binding domain of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nAChR</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] .
        Based on this high-resolution crystal structure, we have
        built an atomic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> of the agonist binding site of nAChR,
        and docked acetylcholine and nicotine to different receptor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">isotypes</ENAMEX>. The resulting models provide a valuable framework
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX>-based design of subtype-specific nAChR
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agonists</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Results and Discussion
        The crystal structure of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> consecutive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AChBP</ENAMEX> monomers
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] was used as a template to build a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">homology</TIMEX>-model of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> known native human nAChR subunit interfaces:
        alpha4-beta2 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">I1</NUMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">alpha4</ENAMEX>-beta4 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">I2</NUMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">alpha3</ENAMEX>-beta2 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">I3</NUMEX>),
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">alpha7-alpha7</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">I4</NUMEX>). The corresponding <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> nAChR
        subtypes are possibly involved in cognition,
        neurodegeneration, pain, anxiety and depression, while
        alpha3<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">-beta2</NUMEX> nAChR is associated with dopamine release and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">addiction</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">alpha7-alpha7</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GABA</ENAMEX> release [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] .
        First, the sequences of the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">five nAChR monomers</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">alpha3,</ENAMEX>
        alpha4, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">alpha7</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">beta2 and beta4</TIMEX>) were aligned to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AChBP</ENAMEX> in a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">multi-protein sequence alignment</ENAMEX>. The alignment was
        generated automatically by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICM</ENAMEX> method and adjusted
        manually around <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">188-208</ENAMEX>, to align an insertion in
        human nAChR subunits with a loop region of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">3D</NUMEX> template
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
        Based on the sequence alignment, the query sequences
        where threaded onto the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> subunits of the AChBP
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pentamer</ENAMEX>. A disulfide <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX> (the so-called cys-loop),
        present only in the alpha subunits of nAChR, is known to be
        part of the agonist binding site of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] .
        This was a clear indication that, in order to build a dimer
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interface</ENAMEX> that includes the ligand binding pocket, alpha
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subunits</ENAMEX> had to be aligned onto the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">template monomer</ENAMEX>
        presenting a disulfide <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bridge</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interface</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">subunit 1</ENAMEX>).
        A putative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HEPES</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-2
        hydroxyethylpiperazine-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>'-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-ethanesulphonic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>) molecule
        is present in the binding pocket of the template structure.
        All <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> in the close vicinity of this ligand were
        confirmed experimentally as being part of the acetylcholine
        binding pocket [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . While the homology between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AChBP</ENAMEX> and
        the nAChR subunits is relatively low (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">22 %</NUMEX> sequence
        identity, for instance, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between alpha4</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AChBP</ENAMEX>), and the
        overall model needs to be refined, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">72%</NUMEX> of the AChBP
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> in contact with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HEPES</ENAMEX> are identical in the
        alpha4<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">-beta2</NUMEX> nAChR (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>), and the predicted
        conformation of the agonist binding pocket of nAChR is
        expected to be accurate. In order to optimize the
        conformation of this pocket, all <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> within <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">7A</NUMEX> of the
        HEPES molecule that were not identical between template and
        model were energy-minimized in the internal coordinate
        space [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . The resulting <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> were used for docking
        experiments.
        Both acetylcholine and nicotine were docked to our model
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">alpha4-beta2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">dimer interface</ENAMEX>. A formal charge of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">+1</NUMEX>
        was assigned to the quaternary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ammonium</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">acetylcholine</ENAMEX> and protonated nicotine. Indeed, a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">correlation</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">between</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">EC50</ENAMEX> values and quantum mechanics
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">simulations</ENAMEX> strongly suggests the existence of a cation-pi
        interaction between a triptophan residue of the ligand
        binding pocket and the quaternary ammonium of acetylcholine
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . A series of grid representations of the ligand
        binding pocket was generated that accounted for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Van</ENAMEX> der
        Waals shape, electrostatic potential, as well as hydrogen
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bonding</ENAMEX> and hydrophobicity profiles. The flexible ligands
        were rapidly docked into the superimposed grids, and the
        lowest energy conformation was further refined with an
        atomic representation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>, and with both ligand
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> side chains flexible [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] (see "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Materials</ENAMEX>
        and Methods" for details).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Acetylcholine</ENAMEX> fits tightly into the agonist binding site
        at the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">alpha4</NUMEX>-beta2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interface</ENAMEX> of nAChR (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). This
        binding site coincides with that of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AChBP</ENAMEX>, and is in
        agreement with photo-affinity labeling and mutagenesis
        study [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6 11</ENAMEX> ] . The ligand makes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Van der Waals</ENAMEX> contact
        with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Trp182</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tyr230</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cys225-226 of alpha4</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Trp82</ENAMEX>,
        Leu146 and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Phe144</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">beta2</TIMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>- Top). The charged
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ammonium nitrogen</ENAMEX> is closest to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">side-chain</ENAMEX> of alpha4
        Trp182. This is in agreement with previous work assigning a
        cation-pi interaction between acetylcholine and this
        residue exclusively [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . The carbonyl <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">acetylcholine</ENAMEX> and backbone nitrogen of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Leul46</ENAMEX> are also
        engaged in a hydrogen bond. Interestingly, a small polar
        cleft next to this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> could accommodate a water
        molecule coordinated by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> hydrogen bond <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX> -alpha4
        Trp182 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">indole nitrogen</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">beta2 Leu146</ENAMEX> amide nitrogen- and
        one hydrogen bond acceptor <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">-beta2 Ser133</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">carbonyl</ENAMEX> (Figure
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Left</ENAMEX>). This water molecule would form an additional
        hydrogen bond with acetylcholine, thereby stabilizing
        further the predicted bound conformation. Surprisingly, the
        ester moiety of acetylcholine does not seem to interact
        with the cys-loop of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>, as previously suggested
        by photoaffinity labeling [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] , but is engaged in
        similar type of interaction as that observed with the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">acidic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HEPES</ENAMEX> in the AChBP crystal structure [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ]
        . It is possible that the reactive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">di-azo</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of the
        photosensitive agonist used in photoaffinity labeling would
        extend towards the cys-loop, while the conformation of the
        bound agonist remains in agreement with our <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nicotine</ENAMEX> makes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Van Der Waals</ENAMEX> contacts with the same
        array of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> side-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>- Bottom). The
        protonated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ammonium nitrogen</ENAMEX> is also making polar
        interaction with the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">delocalized electron</ENAMEX> and backbone
        carbonyl of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Trp182</TIMEX>, and is less than <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1A</NUMEX> away from the
        quaternary nitrogen of docked acetylcholine. Additionally,
        a hydrogen bond between the pyridine nitrogen of nicotine
        and indole nitrogen of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Trp182</ENAMEX> is possible (the two atoms
        are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.4</NUMEX> A apart), but the bond angle is not optimal (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX>
        degrees with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">plane</ENAMEX> of the aromatic side-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX>).
        Interestingly, while <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">conformations</ENAMEX> appear with equal
        probability when the docking is performed without the water
        molecule positioned in the acetylcholine <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>, addition
        of this water molecule results in an extra hydrogen bond
        with the pyridine nitrogen of nicotine, and stabilizes the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">conformation</ENAMEX> presented (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>- Bottom). In the
        alternative, less energetically favorable conformation,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nicotine</ENAMEX> contacts mostly subunit <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">alpha4</TIMEX>, plus <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Leu146</ENAMEX> and
        Trp82 of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">beta2</TIMEX> (data not shown).
        Similarly, acetylcholine and nicotine were docked into
        the agonist binding site at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the alpha3-beta2</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">alpha4</ENAMEX>-beta4
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">alpha7-alpha7</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">interfaces</ENAMEX>. The ligands adopted similar
        conformation as docked to alpha4<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-beta2</TIMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> in
        the vicinity of the ligands are varying from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> receptor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">isotype</ENAMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the other: Thr183</TIMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">alpha4</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ser</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">alpha3</TIMEX> and
        alpha7), <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Ala135</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">beta2</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leu</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">beta4</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Val</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">alpha7</TIMEX>),
        Phe144 of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">beta2</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leu</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">beta4</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gln</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">alpha7</TIMEX>), and Thr83
        of beta2 (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lys</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">beta4</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gln</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">alpha7</TIMEX>) (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
        Neither a threonine, nor a serine at position <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">183</NUMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">subunit 1</ENAMEX> contact the ligands. On the other hand, while
        Ala135 is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">8.5A</NUMEX> away from the docked agonists, a leucine
        could make some hydrophobic interaction with nicotine and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">acetylcholine</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">side-chain</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phe144</ENAMEX> contacts the
        ligands only via its c-alpha an c-beta atoms, and similar
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interaction</ENAMEX> can occur with a leucine or glutamine at this
        position; however, while the conformation presented is
        projecting away from the ligands, alternative conformers
        could bring the side-chain closer to the agonists, and
        represent structural <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">determinants</ENAMEX> for specificity. At last,
        beta-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Thr83</ENAMEX> is rather remote from the ligands (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.5</NUMEX> A), but
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">side-chain</ENAMEX> of a lysine could come closer and influence
        lightly the electrostatic potential of the binding
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cavity</ENAMEX>.
        Based on our <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX>, we calculated the binding energy of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">acetylcholine</ENAMEX> and nicotine to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> receptor isotypes in
        the presence of the water molecule (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>- top). The
        binding energy function, previously validated against a
        diversified benchmark [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] , includes a hydrophobic term,
        an electrostatic term, and an entropic term, but does not
        include <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Van der Waals</ENAMEX> energy, since this term is too noisy;
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Van der Waals</ENAMEX> interactions are supposed to be proportional
        to the interface of the interacting molecules, and
        incorporated into the surface (hydrophobic) <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">term</TIMEX> (see
        Materials and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Methods</ENAMEX>). As a result, the binding energy
        function has an accuracy of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kcal</ENAMEX>/mol, but does not
        account for potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Van der Waals</ENAMEX> clashes. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Van</ENAMEX> der
        Waals interaction energies were calculated separately, and
        are also presented.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1shows</ENAMEX> that binding energy differences between the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> ligands and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> nAChR subtypes are rather small,
        and within the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kcal</ENAMEX>/mol accuracy of the estimates [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>
        ] . As expected, no <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Van der Waals</ENAMEX> clash is observed. The
        calculated energies suggest a lower affinity of nicotine
        for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">alpha7-alpha7</TIMEX> than for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">alpha4-beta2</TIMEX>, which is in
        agreement with experiments [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . The ligands were also
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">docked</ENAMEX> to the crystal structure of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AChBP</ENAMEX> (the binding
        conformation was identical as with nAChRs), and the binding
        energies calculated. Again, the predicted energies of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">acetylcholine</ENAMEX> and nicotine binding to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AChBP</ENAMEX> are close to
        those for binding to nAChRs (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>- top). We also docked
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HEPES</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>, since this ligand was found in the
        crystal structure of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AChBP</ENAMEX>. Low-energy conformations were
        found only in the absence of water molecule, and the
        calculated binding energies (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>- bottom) suggest that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HEPES</ENAMEX> is a poor ligand for nAChRs, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AChBP</ENAMEX>, and was
        observed in the crystal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> because of its high
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">concentration</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">100 mM</NUMEX>) in the crystallization condition [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>
        ] .
        The presence of the isotype diversity of nAChR ligand
        binding pocket should allow for the rational design of
        selective agonists. Variations at <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues alpha4</ENAMEX> Thr183
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">beta2 Ala135</ENAMEX> generate different shapes of the binding
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pocket</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>- Top), but preserve the electrostatic
        potential of the system: all non-conserved <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> at
        position <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">183</NUMEX> are hydrophobic, and hydroxyl of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Thr154</ENAMEX> and
        Ser154 are superimposed, pointing away from the ligand,
        towards the carboxylate of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Asp122</TIMEX>. On the other hand,
        variations at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">residues 83</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">144</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">subunit 2</ENAMEX> can modify
        lightly the charge distribution of the binding site.
        Coloring of the pocket according to its electrostatic
        potential shows for instance that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">alpha7-alpha7</ENAMEX> pocket
        is slightly more electronegative than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">alpha4-beta2</TIMEX> (Figure
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4- Bottom</ENAMEX>). However, these variations are rather limited
        and the agonist binding site remains electronegative for
        all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">isotypes</ENAMEX> tested.
        In order to illustrate how, based on our <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX>, a high
        affinity ligand can be rationally designed to be specific
        for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">beta2-containing</TIMEX> nAChR subtypes, we searched a database
        of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">over 200,000 compounds</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ChemDiv Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego</ENAMEX>, CA),
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">alpha4-beta2</ENAMEX> ligand <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> presenting a functional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> close to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ala</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">135</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">beta2</NUMEX> subunit, hoping that
        such functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> could not accommodate the bulkier <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leu</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">135</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">beta4</TIMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>- Top). Each <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">compound</ENAMEX> of the database
        was docked in the grid potential representation of the
        alpha4<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-beta2 receptor</ENAMEX> (without a water molecule), and
        assigned a score reflecting the quality of the fit, as
        implemented in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICM-VLS</ENAMEX> module (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Molsoft LLC</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego</ENAMEX>,
        CA). The top scoring compounds were considered as good
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ligand</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> and were screened with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> additional
        filters.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) They should present a functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5</TIMEX> A of
        beta2 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ala135</TIMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) They should have a polar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> that fills
        the cavity occupied by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> in the nicotine and
        acetylcholine <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX>, and that makes hydrogen bonds
        similar to the water molecule (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Left</ENAMEX>). We believe
        this <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> filter should result in the identification of
        improved pharmacophores for nAChR ligands.
        Molecule 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1</ENAMEX> is one good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> that matches
        all criteria (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5A</NUMEX>).
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) It is the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">16 thbest</NUMEX> scoring compound, and displays
        better calculated binding energies than acetylcholine or
        nicotine for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">alpha4-beta2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">nAChR</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1- Bottom</ENAMEX>).
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) It presents a pyridine in the vicinity of
        beta2<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-Ala135</TIMEX>, which clashes with the corresponding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leu</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">135</NUMEX>
        of beta4 (Figures <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5Band 5D</ENAMEX>).
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) It displays an amide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> that occupies a cavity not
        filled by nicotine or acetylcholine, and makes a network of
        hydrogen bonds with the indole nitrogen of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">alpha4-Trp182</ENAMEX>,
        the backbone carbonyl of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">beta2-Ser133</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">beta2-Phe144</ENAMEX>, and
        with the backbone nitrogen of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">beta2</ENAMEX>-Leu146 (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5B</NUMEX>).
        To address further the specificity of this ligand
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX>, we docked it, as previously described, to the
        other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> nAChRs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">subtypes</ENAMEX> studied in this work, as well
        as to the crystal structure of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AChBP</ENAMEX>, and calculated the
        corresponding binding energies (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1bottom</ENAMEX>). In all
        cases, the predicted binding energies are better than for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nicotine</ENAMEX> or acetylcholine. The calculated <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Van der Waals</ENAMEX>
        repulsions with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">alpha4-beta2</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">alpha3-beta2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nAChRs</ENAMEX> remain
        small, and within the accuracy limit of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Van der Waals</ENAMEX>
        energy prediction (the otherwise negligible displacement of
        an atom by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a tenth</NUMEX> of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Angstrom</ENAMEX> may result in several
        kcal/mol energy difference). On the other hand, the very
        high <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Van der Waals</ENAMEX> repulsions calculated <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>(bottom)
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">alpha4-beta4</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">alpha7-alpha7</ENAMEX> are a clear indication
        of a steric clash (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5D</NUMEX>): the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ligand</ENAMEX> fits next to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ala</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">135</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">beta2</TIMEX>, but cannot accommodate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leu</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">135</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">beta4</TIMEX>.
      
      
        Conclusions
        Previous reports have shown on other systems that a
        single-residue mutation in a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> is sufficient for the
        development of specific ligands [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14</NUMEX> ] . Based on the
        recent crystal structure of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AChBP</ENAMEX>, we could propose a
        detailed description of the structural variations of nAChR
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subtypes</ENAMEX>. Our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> of the nAChRs binding pocket are only
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">predictive</ENAMEX>, and need to be confirmed experimentally;
        testing 
        in vitro the activity of ligand
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX>, such as 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, derived from the structure of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> would constitute an important <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step towards
        the validation of our <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> as tools for the discovery of
        novel nAChR agonists.

          alpha7, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">beta2 and beta4</TIMEX> nAChR monomers were aligned using
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICM</ENAMEX> multiple sequence alignment algorithm that
          includes the following steps [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 10</NUMEX> ] : <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) pairwise

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Interface</ENAMEX>
          For each nAChR dimer, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">monomer sequences</ENAMEX> were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">threaded</ENAMEX> onto <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two consecutive subunits</TIMEX> of the AChBP
          crystal structure, based on the multiple sequence
          alignment, and the energy of the system was locally
          minimized by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICM</ENAMEX> method [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 18</NUMEX> ] . The orientation
          of all polar hydrogens was systematically optimized
          through conformational space search combined with local
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">minimization</ENAMEX>. All <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nAChR residues</ENAMEX> within <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">7A</NUMEX> of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">putative</ENAMEX> AChBP binding pocket described by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brejc et al.</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> ] that differed from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AChBP</ENAMEX> template <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> were
          energy-minimized in the internal coordinates space using
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICM</ENAMEX> global conformational search algorithm. Energy terms
          included <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Van der Waals</ENAMEX>, electrostatic, hydrogen bond, and
          torsion terms [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] .
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Receptor-Ligand Docking</ENAMEX>
          The flexible ligand / grid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> docking algorithm
          implemented in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICM</ENAMEX> was applied, with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ECEPP/3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> field
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MMFF</ENAMEX> partial charges for the ligand, and hydrophobic,
          electrostatic, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hydrogen</ENAMEX>-bond and surface potential maps
          for the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 19 10</NUMEX> ] . Further optimization with
          flexible ligand and full atom representation of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> was carried out by local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">energy minimization</ENAMEX>,
          where all side-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX> within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6</TIMEX> A of the ligand were
          flexible [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . When docking was performed in the
          presence of a water molecule, the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later</TIMEX> was included in
          the grid representation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>, and was mobile
          during full-atom local minimization.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Binding Energy Calculation</ENAMEX>
          The binding energy function implemented in icm is
          partitioned into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> terms: the hydrophobic, or cavity
          term, that accounts for the variation of water/non-water
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interface</ENAMEX> area, the electrostatic term, composed of the
          coulombic interactions and desolvation of partial charges
          calculated by the boundary elements method, and the
          entropic term, that results from the decrease in the
          conformational freedom of functional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> buried upon
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">complexation</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . A constant term also present in the
          energy function, that accounts for the change of entropy
          of the system due to the decrease of free molecules
          concentration and the loss of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">rotational</ENAMEX>/translational
          degrees of freedom, was omitted, and only differences in
          the binding energies of the ligands are accurate. The
          dielectric constant and surface tension utilized were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">optimized</ENAMEX> against a benchmark of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-protein</ENAMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-small ligand, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-peptide
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">complexes</ENAMEX>, and result in a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">kcal</ENAMEX>/mol accuracy [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ]
          .
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Virtual Library Screening</ENAMEX>
          The high-throughput docking implemented in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICM</ENAMEX>
          program [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] was applied. The procedure followed for
          each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ligand</ENAMEX> was similar than the grid docking previously
          described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] : each flexible ligand of the ChemDiv
          public <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ChemDiv Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego</ENAMEX>) was docked
          automatically into the combination of potential maps
          described above, and assigned a score according to its
          fit with the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">alpha4-beta2</NUMEX> nAChR. The scoring function
          included continuum as well as discreet electrostatics,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hydrophobicity</ENAMEX> and entropy parameters. The screening of
          the database of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 200,000</NUMEX> ligands took <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 2</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> on a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Linux</ENAMEX> cluster of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">150</NUMEX> processors. The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3003</TIMEX>
          compounds which scored better (i.e. lower) than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-35</NUMEX> were
          pre-selected for a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> automatic round of selection:
          only ligands within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5</TIMEX> A of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ala</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">135</NUMEX> of the beta-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> subunit
          and that were hydrogen-bonded to the carbonyl <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> of
          beta-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Ser 133</ENAMEX> were retained. 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> was among the best scoring such
