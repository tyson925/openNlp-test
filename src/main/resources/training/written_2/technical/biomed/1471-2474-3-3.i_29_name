        The knee is one of the most commonly injured joints. The
        stability of the knee is dependent on several muscles, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">meniscus</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> major ligaments. These knee ligaments are
        the medial collateral ligament (MCL), the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral</ENAMEX>
        collateral ligament (LCL), the anterior cruciate ligament
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACL</ENAMEX>), and the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL).
        The effect of strain rate on the failure modes of the
        bone-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ligament</NUMEX>-bone <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> has been investigated. There are
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> failure mechanisms [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] . The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> is
        midsubstance tearing in which the fibers of the ligament
        pull apart in the tissue, generally during a fast loading
        rate. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> mode is ligament-bone interface failure in
        which the fibers fail at the ligament-bone insertion
        without fracture of the underlying bone. The final mode is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tibia</ENAMEX> or femoral avulsion fractures, usually occurring
        during relatively slow loading rates [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ligaments</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone</ENAMEX> have nonlinear time and
        history-dependent viscoelastic properties. These properties
        can be expressed in terms of stress-strain relationships
        with rate as an additional parameter. Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1and</NUMEX> 2show
        typical stress-strain relationships of the ligament and
        bone respectively. For the ligament the slope of the
        stress-strain curve becomes nearly constant in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prefailure</ENAMEX> phase. The curve is composed of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> regions;
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">toe</ENAMEX>, linear, failure, and complete failure [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3 4</NUMEX> ] .
        The ligament failure mode varies with different types of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ligament</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACL</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCL</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCL</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LCL</ENAMEX>) due to their different
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">viscosities</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bone</ENAMEX> also has non-linear behavior and
        the elastic modulus is higher in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone</ENAMEX> than in ligament [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>
        ] .
        Stress (MPa), σ, is defined as the intensity of internal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">force</ENAMEX> over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> cross-sectional area of the original
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">specimen</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . The definition of strain (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">%</NUMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">m/m</ENAMEX>), ε, is
        the change in length of the specimen, divided by its
        initial length [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . Strain with percentage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> is
        obtained by multiplying the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">m/m</ENAMEX> form by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>. The strain
        rate represents the change in elongation with time [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] .
        The extension or deformation rate (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m/sec</ENAMEX>) of the specimen
        divided by its initial length (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX>) gives the strain rate, as
        does the rate of change of the strain itself (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">dε / dt</ENAMEX>). Its
        unit is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">%</NUMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sec</ENAMEX> (or simply sec <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-1</NUMEX>). Unfortunately not all of
        these parameters, or overall dimensions, are always given
        so that reported deformation rates cannot be converted into
        strain rates or vice versa. In addition, strain rates data
        alone does not allow calculations of failure load, since
        neither direct <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> nor effective mass are typically
        reported.
        The electronic version of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medline</ENAMEX> was used to identify
        articles for this review. The keywords used for were strain
        rate, knee injury, and ligament. From the result of this
        search all involving <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">strain-rate</ENAMEX> experiments of the
        bone-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ligament</NUMEX>-bone <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> were further considered. Papers
        with only one bone-ligament attachment were excluded, as
        were those with only relative strain rates. The selected
        papers were further limited to those reporting quantified
        strain rates and the specific nature of the failures.
        There are many recent studies on the effect of the
        strain rate on the failure mode of the knee [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8 9 10 11</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13 14 15</NUMEX> ] . These are summarized in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>. The
        results of most studies show that at low strain rates
        avulsion occurs at the ligament insertion site on the bone
        or the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone</ENAMEX> itself may fail. At high strain rate, it is
        generally reported that the ligament tears [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8 9 10 11 12</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14 15</NUMEX> ] . However, the definitions of a fast or slow
        rate, and the actual rate range covered in each study, are
        different. In addition, the orientation of the
        bone-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ligament</NUMEX>-bone <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> during testing may also affect
        the results, but details of this orientation are not
        typically provided.
        Viidik 
        et al. studied the effects of
        training in a running <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">machine</ENAMEX> on rabbits. They showed the
        weakest point in the tibia-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ligament</NUMEX>-femur system to be one
        of the bony attachments, most often the tibial <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ]
        .
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1974</TIMEX>(a) Noyes 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">et al. used rhesus monkeys</ENAMEX> to
        investigate the effect of strain rate changes on the
        failure mode. The approximate strain rates were <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.62 %</NUMEX>/sec
        -1at the slow rate and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">67 %</NUMEX>/sec -1at the fast rate.
        Ligament tearing happened more at the fast strain rate,
        with bone avulsion occurring more at the slow strain rate [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> ] . They also analyzed the effects of activity on
        ligament failure using the strain rate of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">66.2 %</NUMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sec</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ]
        . This study showed <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60 %</NUMEX> ligament tearing in the control
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">44%</NUMEX> ligament tearing and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">39%</NUMEX> bony avulsion with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX> of immobilization, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">45 %</NUMEX> ligament tearing and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">36%</NUMEX> bony
        avulsion from an exercise <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">65 %</NUMEX> ligament tearing
        from a reconditioning group [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] .

        rate on <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Beagle dogs</ENAMEX> to study the strength of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACL</ENAMEX>. The
        mid part of the ligament ruptured in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">93.7%</NUMEX> of the tests [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> ] .
        Crownishield 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX> tested failure characteristics
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCL</ENAMEX> of rats at strain rates of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8.45*10 -2</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">84.5</NUMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19000</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">51000 %</NUMEX>/sec. As the strain rate increased,
        ligament tearing occurred more than avulsion. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX>
        described the range of injury strain rates in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">man</ENAMEX> as from
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 50 %</NUMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sec</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">150,000 %</NUMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sec</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kennedy</ENAMEX> 
        et al. conducted ultimate failure
        strengths of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACL</ENAMEX> at the strain rates of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">140</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">%/sec.</ENAMEX> The ages of the human specimens ranged from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 to 75</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, with a mean of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">62 years</TIMEX>. The major mode of failure
        was ligament tearing at both of the strain rates. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ]
        .
        In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1976</TIMEX> Noyes 
        et al. evaluated the strength of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACL</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> and rhesus <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkeys</ENAMEX> to analyze age and species
        related changes. The age range of the human specimens was
        from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48 to 86 years</TIMEX> for an older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, and from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 to 26</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> for a younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rhesus monkeys</ENAMEX> were 15 years
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">old</ENAMEX>. For the human specimens a strain rate of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sec</ENAMEX> was
        used for both old and young specimens. A strain rate of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">66</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">%/sec</ENAMEX> was used for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkeys</ENAMEX>. Ligament tearing was
        predominant in the specimens from younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> and from
        rhesus <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkeys</ENAMEX>. Avulsion of bone beneath the ligament
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">insertion</ENAMEX> site was seen for the older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] .
        Woo 
        et al. studied the effect of strain
        rate on MCL failures in skeletally immature and mature
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rabbits</ENAMEX>. The range of strain rate used was from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.011</NUMEX> to
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">222 %</NUMEX>/sec. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tibia</ENAMEX> avulsion developed in all specimens from
        skeletally immature rabbits with the strain rate from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.011</NUMEX>
        to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">155 %</NUMEX>/sec. Results for this group were not reported
        above <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">155 %</NUMEX>/sec. However, ligament tearing occurred from
        skeletally mature rabbits with the strain rate from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.011</NUMEX>
        to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">222 %</NUMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sec</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] .
        Schenck 
        et al. investigated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> "clinically
        applicable" stain rates, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100 and 5400</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">%/sec</ENAMEX> to study human
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACL</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCL</ENAMEX> hyperextension. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCL</ENAMEX>, ligament tearing
        occurred at the lower stain rate, where as bone avulsion
        occurred at the higher strain rate. The order of these
        results is contrary to that of most of the other studies.
        In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACL</ENAMEX>, the major failure mode at the low stain rate
        was similar to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCL</ENAMEX>, with a mixed failure pattern at the
        higher strain rate [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] .
        The scope of these studies covers <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a very</NUMEX> wide range of
        strain rates, multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, various ages, and in some
        cases direct intervention. Given this diverse set of
        results, a mathematical model of ligament and bony insert
        behavior was developed to provide an integrated
        understanding of the reported variations in failure
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mode</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Qualitative
          We present a qualitative analytical model to analyze
          and explain these various results. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> takes into
          account the individual rate sensitivity of the strength
          of both the ligament and the bony insertion points. This
          provides an integrated view of the strength and failure
          mode of the combined system. As the strain rate
          increases, the stiffness and peak failure loads of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ligament</ENAMEX> and bone both increase [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 3 16</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3shows
          the relationship between the ultimate <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX> and strain
          for bone alone and ligament alone with loading rates.
          While the exact mechanisms of these changes are not well
          understood, the effect of strain rate on the
          stress-strain curves is produced in part by internal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">viscosity</ENAMEX> and energy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">dissipation</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Individually,</ENAMEX>
          these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">properties</ENAMEX> can be viewed as providing a protective
          mechanism under many circumstances in that they make the
          joint stiffer and stronger at high loading rates, at
          least up to their strength limits. When reported failure
          modes are considered for the bone-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ligament</NUMEX>-bone complex,
          the effect of the changing strain rate on the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone</ENAMEX> must
          be greater than that on the ligament.
          Failure mode I represents the situation in which bone
          avulsion occurs preferentially over ligament tearing. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ultimate</ENAMEX> failure stress of both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone</ENAMEX> and ligament (σ 
          ult, B , σ 
          ult, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX> ) is relatively small at these
          strain rates compared to the strengths at higher loading
          rates. The strength of the ligament at these rates is
          generally greater than the strength of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone</ENAMEX>. Therefore,
          the bony avulsion failure is more common at low strain
          rates because the bone failure point is reached <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>.
          The use of stress as the controlling parameter is based
          on the assumption of a ligament of uniform area and an
          equal effective bone insertion area. Alternatively the
          discussion could be based on load rather than stress,
          without changing the general argument.
          Failure mode <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> is the case of bony avulsion or
          ligament tearing occurring at similar frequency, i.e.,
          where the ultimate stress of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone</ENAMEX> and ligament are
          similar across the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. This mode occurs at higher
          strain rates than those of mode <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">I.</ENAMEX> While both ligament
          and bone insertion strengths are larger than those in
          mode I at these larger stain rates, the strengths of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ligament</ENAMEX> and the insertion approach equality. Because
          there is not a clearly preferred type of failure in mode
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">II</ENAMEX>, which failure occurs is likely defined more by
          individual variation than by fundamental
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biomechanics</ENAMEX>.
          Failure mode III occurs at higher strain rates in
          which ligament tearing predominates over <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone avulsion</ENAMEX>.
          As the strain rate increases further above that of mode
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">II</ENAMEX>, the ultimate stress of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone</ENAMEX> and ligament continue to
          increase, but now the strength of the bone becomes
          stronger than that of the ligament [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3</NUMEX> ] .
          When the strain rate increases overwhelmingly over
          that of mode <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">III</ENAMEX>, the ultimate stress of bone stays about
          the same as in mode III but the ultimate stress of the
          ligament increases over that of mode III. Failure mode I
          show again. Also, failure mode II represents as the
          strain rate increases more than that of mode <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">I. Fig</ENAMEX>.
          4represents <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">modes I, II</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">III</ENAMEX>, I, and II.
        
        
          Quantitative
          We use the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Kelvin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> as a conceptual representation
          for describing the individual behavior of both the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ligament</ENAMEX> and the bone as a function of loading rate. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kelvin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> is composed of a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">spring</TIMEX> and dashpot element
          arranged in parallel (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>).
          The total <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX> in each system is
          
          
          where 
          E is the respective <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Young</ENAMEX>'s modulus
          or the modulus of elasticity, η is the respective
          coefficient of viscosity, and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">ε</NUMEX>( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> ), are the respective strains and
          strain rates.
          To model the effect of constant strain rate, is set to
          a constant value denoted by . From this, equation (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) can
          be written as
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6represents that <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX> and strain in the
          ligament have a linear relationship under the conditions
          shown in equation (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>). While this is not the usually
          quoted result, it must be remembered that here this is
          under the specific condition of constant strain rate
          loading. When the strain rate increases the slope of this
          curve also increases. These equations describe the effect
          of strain rate on ligament performance, although a
          failure point still has to be specified.
          Neglecting the inertia term for the ligament, a
          balance of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> requires that the bone stress σ 
          B ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> ) be equal to the ligament stress
          σ 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> ) for constant area. Therefore,
          it is possible to solve for the strain ε 
          B ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> ) from equation (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>).
          
          The final equation is following.
          
          While the strain ε 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> ) is only the given function of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>, the strain ε 
          B ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> ) is a function of time and
          constant terms related to both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone</ENAMEX> and ligament
          properties.

        Noyes, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1974a</TIMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1974b</ENAMEX>, studied
        the ACL failure mode of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Rhesus monkeys</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> study
        shows mode I at slow strain rate and mode III at fast
        strain rate. The mixed results suggest operation in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mode II</ENAMEX> region with significant individual variability. In

        Assuming immobilization reduces strength, σ 
        ult, B reduced more than σ 
        ult, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX> , so that they approached
        equality. In exercise, either σ 
        ult, B and σ 
        ult, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX> is not significantly affected, or
        they both may increase without significant relative
        changes. In the latter case the analysis is limited by the
        lack of information actual failure loads or stresses. Even
        though changing their relative value, this effect is
        consistent with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viidik</ENAMEX>,

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1976</TIMEX> studied <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACL</ENAMEX> failure in
        human specimens. Even though different strain rates were
        used, mode III applies to both strain rates in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kennedy</ENAMEX>. In

        affect the relative value of σ

        ult, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX> . However, we have different
        results in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Noyes</ENAMEX>, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al's</ENAMEX> study. The older (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48-86</NUMEX>

        the same failure mode as the younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. These results
        demonstrate that strain rate alone is not the defining
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">parameter</ENAMEX>. Analytically this would be reflected by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">E</ENAMEX>, η,
        and σ 
        ult being a function of age and other
        conditions.
        In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Crownishield</ENAMEX>, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX>'s rabbit specimens, like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noyes</ENAMEX>,
        
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al's</ENAMEX> study, increasing the strain
        rate caused a shift from mode <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">I, to II</ENAMEX>, to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">III</ENAMEX>. The MCL
        study of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Woo et</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al</ENAMEX> is similar to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crownishield et</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al</ENAMEX>
        except for the range of strain rate. Mode I applies to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immature</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> for all strain rates and mode III to mature
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> for all strain rates. Maturing increases strength,
        presumably more so for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone</ENAMEX> than ligament, and causing σ 
        ult, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">B ></ENAMEX> σ 
        ult, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX> . The effect of the strain rates
        used in each group is not seen, probably because they are
        not sufficiently different.
        Schenck, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> reported their results as
        different from previous studies, but this is not clear
        given the variation in specimens and strain rates used.
        Therefore, the results of the effect of strain rate for the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCL</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACL</ENAMEX> were reverse from those of the previous
        studies, using strain rates intended to correlate
        differences between sporting and trauma [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . However,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> other study, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Crownnishield</ENAMEX>, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> MCL, used strain
        rates as high or higher than <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schenck</ENAMEX>, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX>'s "fast" rate. Accepting that
        the rate and human results are consistent, Schenck 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX>'s results suggest that the
        relative effect of stain rate on strength has a second
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross</ENAMEX> over point. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 8shows this relationship.
      
      
        Discussion
        The effect of the strain rate on the failure modes of
        the bone-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ligament</NUMEX>-bone <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> is an important factor in
        knee joint injury. We have defined <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> ranges of failure
        as a function of strain rate and other parameters. Avulsion
        happens more than ligament tearing in mode I which is
        primarily associated with low strain rates. The number of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">avulsion</ENAMEX> is comparable with the number of ligament tears in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mode II</ENAMEX>, where <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> variation is the dominant effect.
        Ligament tearing occurs more than bony avulsion in mode III
        that is associated with high strain rates. Finally, at very
        high strain rates the continued attraction in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone</ENAMEX> and
        ligament strength again, causes the ligament to become
        stronger than <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone</ENAMEX>. Thus, mode <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">I and mode II</ENAMEX> can be defined
        based on strain rates. The integrative concept for these
        failure modes is that both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone</ENAMEX> and ligament strengths
        increase with increasing strain rates, and that these are
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least two</NUMEX> points at which these functions cross. These
        results have important implications with respect to further
        experimental studies in this area. It is critical that
        strain rates be carefully defined, and that comparisons
        with other work be made on the basis of similar values,
        rather than just "high" and "low". <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Secondly</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, age,
        condition and other variables compound the difficulty of
        drawing broad conclusions, as does the lack of detail on
        orientation of the bone-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ligament</NUMEX>-bone <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> during
        testing.
