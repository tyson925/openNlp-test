        Opioid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> belong to the large superfamily of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein coupled receptors</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> major types of
        opioid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors (Î¼</ENAMEX>, Î´ and Îº) have been cloned and each one
        is associated with several physiological and behavioural
        roles. The focus of the present work is the Î´ opioid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Delta</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">opioid receptors</ENAMEX> play a modulatory role in
        analgesia, hibernation, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">autonomic</ENAMEX> nervous system function,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neuroendocrine</ENAMEX> system function, mood driven behaviours and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">olfaction</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . Thus, understanding the requirements for
        activation of Î´ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">opioid receptors</ENAMEX> can lead to identification
        and design of novel drugs acting through this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> for
        treatment of various physiological problems.
        While designing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> with selectivity to a single
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> can be a desirable approach in drug design,
        another approach may be to design <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> that act on more
        than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> receptor, but with differential activity on each
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>. These would be <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> that act as an agonist at
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> and as an antagonist or partial agonist at
        another receptor type. The latter approach would be useful
        in situations where the same <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> type that mediates
        the beneficial effect of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> also mediates the
        untoward effect [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . In this case interaction with
        another receptor type could reverse the unwanted effects
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with the activation of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>.
        In the absence of comprehensive activation data for
        opioid ligands at Î´ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">opioid receptors</ENAMEX>, we set out to
        characterize a set of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fifteen opioid ligands</ENAMEX> for their
        activity in cells expressing only Î´ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">opioid receptors</ENAMEX>. These
        ligands were selected based on our previous data showing
        that they bound <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">opioid receptors</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . However,
        model tissue studies [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] and 
        in vivo studies [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] had suggested
        that these ligands exhibited differential activation
        profiles at the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">opioid receptors</ENAMEX>. Thus the present
        study was designed, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) to describe the activation profiles
        of a set of opioid ligands not previously defined at an
        isolated cell system expressing only Î´ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">opioid receptors</ENAMEX>,
        and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) to compare the relative efficacies and potencies of
        these ligands to the strongest ligand in the set,
        metazocine, to the common opioid analgesic, morphine and to
        the endogenous Î´ opioid ligand, met-enkephalin.
        In this study, the activity of Î´ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">opioid receptor</ENAMEX> was
        measured by assessing the levels of inhibition of
        forskolin-stimulated cAMP production in the presence of
        various opioid ligands. It has been reported that Î´ opioid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">receptors couple</ENAMEX> more efficiently to adenylyl cyclase
        system than to Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channels</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . This evidence supports
        the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cAMP system</ENAMEX> for assessing the activity of these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>. Moreover, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cAMP</ENAMEX> has been implicated in playing a
        role in the analgesic effects mediated through Î´ opioid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9</NUMEX> ] . Human embryonic kidney cells stably
        expressing mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Î´ opioid receptors</ENAMEX> were used to
        characterize the activation profiles of opioid ligands in
        this study. The results describe the activity of a set of
        ligands not previously characterized at Î´ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">opioid receptors</ENAMEX>.
        The results obtained from this study will serve to define
        the relative efficacies and potencies of a set of opioid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ligands</ENAMEX> compared to one another and differentiate between
        the full and partial agonists at Î´ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">opioid receptors</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Results
        
          Receptor activation
          All ligands used (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>) were non-peptide ligands
          selected for lack of selectivity for different opioid
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>. In the majority of cases the data were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reproducible</ENAMEX> and inter-experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">variability</ENAMEX> was small
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Thus the data from several experiments were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">normalized</ENAMEX> to the top of the fitted curve (no ligand,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">forskolin</ENAMEX> alone), the results of several experiments
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pooled</ENAMEX> and a new fitted curve constructed (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). The
          IC 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> values in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1are</ENAMEX> the results of
          the pooled normalized data from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> or more experiments
          carried out in duplicate.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> ligands, nalbuphine and naltrexone were
          categorized as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX>. All other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ligands</ENAMEX> studied
          showed a robust inhibitory effect on the forskolin
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stimulated</ENAMEX> cAMP production (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). The rank order of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">efficacy of the ligands</ENAMEX> tested was <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">metazocine</ENAMEX> = xorphanol

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dezocine</ENAMEX>. Statistical analysis showed that most of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agonists</ENAMEX> tested had efficacies that were not
          significantly different from that of the endogenous
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ligand</ENAMEX> met-enkephalin. The only exceptions were the
          highly efficacious ligands fentanyl (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 0.05</ENAMEX>),
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">metazocine</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 0.001</ENAMEX>) and xorphanol (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">p</ENAMEX> <
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.001</NUMEX>).
          The potencies for the different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ligands</ENAMEX> ranged from
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.2</NUMEX> - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2039</NUMEX> nM. The most potent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ligands</ENAMEX> studied, as
          measured by the lowest IC 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> values (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>), were etorphine,
          cyclazocine, lofentanil, and xorphanol with IC 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> 's of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 10</NUMEX> nM. The other
          ligands, met-enkephalin, WIN <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44,441</NUMEX>, hydromorphone and
          Butorphanol, exhibited potencies of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10-100</NUMEX> nM; metazocine
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SKF</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10047</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">100-200</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">nM</ENAMEX>, and nalbuphine, dezocine and
          morphine, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">400-1000 nM.</ENAMEX> The least potent <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ligand</ENAMEX> was
          fentanyl with an IC 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 2 Î¼M</NUMEX>. The rank order of
          potency of these ligands was;

          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2depicts</NUMEX> dose-response curves of a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> set of ligands. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Etorphine</ENAMEX> and lofentanil
          are shown as examples of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> very efficacious and highly
          potent ligands. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SKF</ENAMEX> 10047 is <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> of a very
          efficacious ligand with intermediate potency. Finally,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fentanyl</ENAMEX> is shown as an example of a ligand with very low
          potency, which is nevertheless very efficacious if high
          enough concentrations are used.
        
        
          Receptor binding
          Human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells were transfected to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">express</ENAMEX> mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Î´ opioid receptors</ENAMEX>. These cells do not
          express any <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">endogenous Î´ opioid receptors</ENAMEX>, as they lack
          binding of the radioactive tracer [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3H</TIMEX>]-DPDPE (data not
          shown), thus they serve as a good system for the
          expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">opioid receptors</ENAMEX>. A single clone of HEK
          cells, stably expressing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1925</TIMEX> Â± <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">425</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fmole</ENAMEX>/mg <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> Î´
          opioid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>, was selected for this study. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          d for [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3H</TIMEX>]-DPDPE in these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> was
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.65 Â± 0.27 nM</NUMEX>. These cells were used to characterize the
          activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">fifteen opioid ligands</ENAMEX> in inhibiting
          forskolin-stimulated cAMP production.
          Ligands that showed very low potencies or low enough
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">efficacies</ENAMEX> to be tested for antagonistic effect were
          further characterized for their binding affinities at Î´
          opioid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>. All <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ligands</ENAMEX> studied exhibited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          i values in nanomolar range. The rank
          order of affinity of the ligands was xorphanol > Win
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">44,441></NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">nalorphine > morphine â‰¥ nalbuphine</ENAMEX> >
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fentanyl</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). The rank order of affinity agrees
          with the rank order of potency of these ligands in
          inhibiting forskolin-stimulated cAMP production.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        Ligands acting at Î´ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> can induce antinociception
        both spinally and supraspinally [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11 12</NUMEX> ] , thus
        identifying ligands that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">activate Î´ opioid receptors</ENAMEX> and
        determining their physiochemical characteristics is
        essential to understanding opioid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor pharmacology</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">physiology</ENAMEX>. There is evidence suggesting that Î´ selective
        opioid ligands do not cause changes in respiratory
        parameters [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . Thus, suggesting that designing
        specific ligands that act at Î´ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">opioid receptors</ENAMEX> may be
        useful in formulating analgesics without the side effect of
        ventilatory <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">depression</ENAMEX>. Yet, some selective Î´ ligands have
        been shown to be ineffective antinociceptive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> when
        given <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">systemically</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15 16</NUMEX> ] . The reason for this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ineffectiveness</ENAMEX> is not clear. Still, other reports, have
        suggested that opioid ligands with agonistic effect at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Î</NUMEX>¼
        opioid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> and antagonistic effect at Î´ opioid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> are potentially useful analgesics [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3 17 18</ENAMEX> ] .
        These latter results advocate that the key to designing
        opioid ligands with optimal analgesia and minimal side
        effects may be in the design of ligands that act on more
        than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> receptor type, but activate each receptor
        differently. Thus, it is useful to identify opioid ligands
        with differential activation profiles and characterize
        their physiological effects (analgesic and unwanted
        effects). Prior to the design of any novel <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> based on
        this approach, it is necessary to clearly understand how
        the known nonselective opioid ligands act at Î´ opioid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>. Such information can not only help explain some
        of the paradoxical behavioural data of these ligands, but
        it can also explain the interaction of each ligand with a
        single receptor involved in modulation of the pain
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathways</ENAMEX>. The present data serve to define the mode of
        action of a set of opioid ligands at Î´ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">opioid receptors</ENAMEX> and
        will help explain the physiological effect of these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ligands</ENAMEX>. Moreover, since Î´ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">opioid receptors</ENAMEX> have been
        reported to exert a physiology indicative of regulatory
        effects on hemodynamic balance and cardiac function as well
        as hibernation, a better understanding of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Î´</ENAMEX> receptor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pharmacology</ENAMEX> can lead to possible novel uses of Î´ ligands
        independent of analgesia.
        The present study was designed as one of the steps in
        defining the detailed pharmacology of a set of
        non-selective opioid ligands and aimed at defining the
        activation profiles of these ligands at a well-defined
        system expressing only Î´ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">opioid receptors</ENAMEX>. The use of such
        a system is essential for understanding the mode of action
        of ligands at a specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>. Such data can then be
        used to interpret the findings from more complex settings,
        such as 
        in vivo studies, where multiple
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">opioid</ENAMEX> receptor <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">types</ENAMEX> are expressed.
        The data presented in this report agree with available
        published data, thus establishing that the methods used
        were valid and could be successfully used to provide useful
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> for previously uncharacterised ligands. For example,
        as reported, etorphine [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] and lofentanil [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] were
        shown to be highly potent and efficacious at Î´ opioid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>.
        Comparison of the efficacies of the set of agonists in
        this study to that of the endogenous ligand,
        met-enkephalin, showed that all were full agonists.
        Moreover, fentanyl, metazocine and xorphanol could be
        considered "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">super agonists</ENAMEX>" at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">delta</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> based on
        having efficacies significantly greater than
        met-enkephalin. This observation suggests that in
        situations where the endogenous ligand is present (such as
        in a stressed animal), it is possible to achieve further
        activation of Î´ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">opioid receptors</ENAMEX> by the application of one
        of these ligands. Moreover, the efficacies of the above
        "super agonists" were comparable to that of Î´ selective
        ligands such as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">SNC80 and BW373U86</TIMEX>. Based on previous
        reports, maximum inhibitory effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SNC-80</ENAMEX> in transfected
        Î´ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">opioid receptors</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">71</NUMEX> Â± <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">94</NUMEX> Â± <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2%</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ]
        with IC 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> values of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 and 6.3</NUMEX> nM respectively.
        The maximum effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BW373U86</ENAMEX> has been reported to be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX> Â±
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9%</NUMEX> with IC 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.9 nM</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . Some ligands that
        exhibited very low potencies in this study, such as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fentanyl</ENAMEX> or metazocine, were amongst the most efficacious
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ligands</ENAMEX> tested suggesting that these ligands are capable of
        maximally <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">activating Î´ opioid receptors</ENAMEX>. Thus, different
        concentrations of these ligands can be used to achieve
        various physiological effects based on the pharmacological
        properties of these ligands on other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">opioid receptors</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fentanyl</ENAMEX> is a synthetic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">opioid</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ligand</ENAMEX> belonging to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">phenylpiperidine</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of ligands. Based on receptor
        binding assays, fentanyl has an affinity for Î¼ opioid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">receptors</ENAMEX>, that is <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">100-1000</ENAMEX> fold higher than that for Î´
        opioid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 24</NUMEX> ] . However, no published
        activation data for fentanyl at Î´ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">opioid receptors</ENAMEX> was
        available. 
        In vivo , fentanyl is a strong
        analgesic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">agent</ENAMEX> in pharmacological doses due to its
        interaction with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Î¼ opioid receptors</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . However, at
        higher toxic doses it shows general opioid toxicity
        symptoms in addition to muscular rigidity, which are
        reversible by naloxone. Muscular rigidity of fentanyl has
        been suggested to occur via several mechanism involving
        glutamatergic pathways [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] , serotonergic system [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ]
        as well as noradrenergic system [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27 28</NUMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> other
        potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pathway</ENAMEX> may be via regulation of dopaminergic
        system as suggested before [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] possibly via Î´ opioid
        receptor system as explained here. It has been reported
        that stimulation of Î´ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">opioid receptors</ENAMEX> can cause inhibition
        of dopamine release in striatal pathways, resulting in
        muscular rigidity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . The present report shows that
        although fentanyl has low affinity and low potency at Î´
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">opioid</ENAMEX> receptor, it is highly efficacious at these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>. Thus, at high fentanyl concentrations Î´ opioid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> can also be fully activated possibly leading to
        the inhibition of dopamine release and the resultant muscle
        rigidity. So the data presented can serve to describe the
        mechanism of action and physiological observations after
        application of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> 
        in vivo . Based on the present data,
        a distinct effect of morphine compared to fentanyl can be
        observed at Î´ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">opioid receptors</ENAMEX>. While fentanyl is a full
        agonist at Î´ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">opioid receptors</ENAMEX>, morphine is only a partial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agonist</ENAMEX>. Thus, although both these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> can activate Î´
        opioid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> with low potency, at high concentrations
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">morphine</ENAMEX> cannot stimulate Î´ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> as effectively as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fentanyl</ENAMEX>. Thus, fentanyl, but not morphine, can elicit
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">physiological</ENAMEX> changes that are mediated by activation of Î´
        opioid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>.
        A different scenario holds true for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> ligands,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">xorphanol</ENAMEX> and WIN <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44,441</NUMEX>. Both these ligands have high
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">affinities</ENAMEX> and potencies at Î´ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">opioid receptors</ENAMEX> with
        xorphanol being very efficacious at Î´ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">opioid receptors</ENAMEX>. At
        Î¼ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">opioid receptors</ENAMEX>, however, the activation profiles of
        these ligands are different. While both these ligands bind
        with high affinities (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">less than 1 nM</NUMEX>) to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Î</NUMEX>¼ opioid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">receptors</ENAMEX>, WIN <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44,441</NUMEX> acts as an antagonist at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Î</NUMEX>¼ opioid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> and xorphanol is a very weak agonist at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Î</NUMEX>¼ opioid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">receptor</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gharagozlou et</ENAMEX> al. unpublished results). Thus
        these ligands can be useful in clinical applications where
        activation of Î´ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">opioid receptors</ENAMEX> needs to be combined with
        a weak action or an antagonistic action at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Î</NUMEX>¼ opioid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>. Such an application can be very important due to
        the unique physiology of Î´ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">opioid receptors</ENAMEX>. Studies such
        as presented here can serve to provide the data necessary
        for application of opioid ligands in such unique settings.
        Moreover, until now the activity of xorphanol at Î´ opioid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">receptors</ENAMEX> had not been described. This ligand had been
        described as a mixed agonist-antagonist opioid ligand [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX> ] with agonistic activity at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Î</NUMEX>º <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">opioid receptors</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] .
        Overall very little work has been done on xorphanol and
        little is known about it except that it is an orally active
        analgesic with limited physical dependence liability [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ]
        . Thus the present report describing its activity at Î´
        opioid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> provides useful data on this ligand.
        Nalorphine, has been previously categorized as a "mixed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">agonist/antagonist</ENAMEX>" ligand [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . These are ligands that
        are believed to act as an agonist at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Î</NUMEX>º and as an antagonist
        at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Î</NUMEX>¼ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">opioid receptors</ENAMEX>. No published 
        in vitro data was available for the
        activation profile of this ligand at Î´ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">opioid receptors</ENAMEX>. In
        this study nalorphine was shown to be an antagonist at Î´
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">opioid</ENAMEX> receptor with a moderate binding affinity. Such a
        moderate affinity makes it possible for nalorphine to
        antagonize the effect of other ligands or the endogenous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ligand</ENAMEX> (like met-enkephalin) at Î´ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">opioid receptors</ENAMEX> while
        possibly acting as an agonist at other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">opioid receptors</ENAMEX>.
        Based on the regulatory role of Î´ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">opioid receptors</ENAMEX> such
        applications may be numerous. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> similar to the one
        presented in this report, will open the door for novel
        applications of these ligands in the treatment of various
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ailments</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Conclusions
        The present study was designed to characterize the
        activation profiles of a set of opioid ligands in cells
        expressing only Î´ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">opioid receptors</ENAMEX>. These ligands had not
        been previously characterized at Î´ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">opioid receptors</ENAMEX>. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> produced from this study can be used to achieve
        several goals. (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) These data can lead to elucidation of
        the complete activation profiles of these ligands, leading
        to clarification of the mechanisms involved in
        physiological effects of these ligands at Î´ opioid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>. (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) These data can be used as a basis for novel
        use of existing opioid ligands based on their pharmacology
        at Î´ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">opioid receptors</ENAMEX>. (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) These 
        in vitro data can be utilized to
        define the physiochemical features of the ligands defining
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agonism</ENAMEX> and antagonism at Î´ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">opioid receptors</ENAMEX>, leading to
        design and discovery of novel opioid analgesics. (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) In
        combination with 
        in vivo data characterizing analgesic
        and unwanted effects of these ligands, the 
        in vitro data can be used to identify
        the activation profile of the ideal opioid analgesic that
        has minimal side effects. Such information, combined with
        the knowledge on the physiochemical characteristics of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agonists</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX> at each receptor, will lead to the
        design of novel opioid analgesics with minimal side
        effects.

          Rockville, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MD</ENAMEX>). Stable clones were selected using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Î¼g/ml Geneticin Â®.</ENAMEX> Single clone were picked and tested
          for expression of Î´ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">opioid</ENAMEX> receptor by binding assay. One

          assessed by [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3H</TIMEX>]-DPDPE binding, was propagated for use
          in this study.
        
        
          Binding assays
          Saturation binding assays were carried out for [
          3H]-DPDPE in HEK cells as described previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] .
          Crude cell homogenate (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20-25 Î¼g</NUMEX> of per assay tube) was
          used and incubation was in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tris HCl</ENAMEX>, pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.4</NUMEX> at room
          temperature for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 hours</TIMEX>. The assay was terminated by
          rapid filtration through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Whatman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GF/B</ENAMEX> filters using a
          FilterMate <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell harvester</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Packard Instruments</ENAMEX>) followed
          by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> washes, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> ml each, with ice cold buffer.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Radioactivity</ENAMEX> retained on the filters was measured using
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Microscint 0</ENAMEX> in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TopCount</ENAMEX> liquid scintillation counter
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Packard Instruments</ENAMEX>). Competition binding assays were
          carried out in crude <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">membrane</ENAMEX> homogenate of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HEK</ENAMEX>-Î´ cells.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Binding</ENAMEX> was carried out in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250</NUMEX> Î¼l volume of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> mM Tris
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCl</ENAMEX> buffer, pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.4</NUMEX> in the presence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nM</ENAMEX> [
          3H]-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPDPE</ENAMEX> and increasing concentrations (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24-32</NUMEX> different
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">concentrations</ENAMEX>) of unlabeled ligand. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Incubation</ENAMEX> and
          binding were as described above. Binding data were
          analyzed using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affinity Analysis Software</ENAMEX> as
          described before [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34 35</NUMEX> ] . For preparation of crude
          membrane homogenate, confluent cultures of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HEK</ENAMEX>-Î´ cells
          were harvested using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">phosphate buffered saline</ENAMEX>. Following
          centrifugation at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">700</NUMEX> Ã—g, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell pellet</ENAMEX> was resuspended
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ice</ENAMEX>-cold <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tris HCl</ENAMEX> buffer pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.4</NUMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 10</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">7cell/ml</ENAMEX>, and homogenized using a polytron at setting 6
          for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 seconds</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell homogenate</ENAMEX> was stored in
          aliquots at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">-86Â°C until</TIMEX> use. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Protein</ENAMEX> content of the cell
          homogenate was determined using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bio-Rad protein</ENAMEX> assay
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reagent</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bio-Rad</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hercules</ENAMEX>, CA).
        
        
          Whole cell adenylyl cyclase assays
          Inhibition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Forskolin</ENAMEX> stimulated cyclic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMP</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cAMP</ENAMEX>)
          production by exposure to increasing concentrations of
          agonists were evaluated in intact cells. Exponentially
          growing HEK-Î´ cells were harvested and resuspended in
          serum free <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">DMEM/F12</ENAMEX> medium. Cells were plated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">96</TIMEX> well
          microtiter plates at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5 Ã— 10 4cells/</ENAMEX>well in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> Î¼l volume.
          To each well, phosphodiesterase inhibitor
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine</TIMEX> (IBMX) was added to a final
          concentration of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100 Î¼M</NUMEX>, followed by addition of agonists
          at different concentrations and incubation at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37Â°C</TIMEX>.
          Following <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15 minutes</TIMEX> incubation, forskolin was added to
          each well to a final concentration of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 Î</NUMEX>¼M followed by
          another incubation for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15 min</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37Â°C</TIMEX>. The final reaction
          volume was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">200 Î¼l</NUMEX>. The reaction was terminated by
          aspiration of the medium and addition of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">200 Î¼l</NUMEX> lysis
          buffer from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Biotrakâ„¢ cAMP Enzyme Immunoassay</ENAMEX> kit from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amersham Pharmacia Biotech</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buckinghamshire</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX>).
          The rest of the assay followed the protocol provided with
          the kit. Actual amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cAMP</ENAMEX> was determined for each
          sample in comparison to a standard curve of known amounts
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cAMP</ENAMEX> provided in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cAMP</ENAMEX> kit, as described in the kit
          protocol.
        
        
          Agonism
          Agonistic activity of opioid ligands was assessed by
          measuring the inhibitory effect of the ligands on
          forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> from each
          experiment were normalized to the top of the curve (no
          ligand, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX>), expressed <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as percent</NUMEX> inhibition of
          forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation and were fit to a
          sigmoidal function by using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> site competition function
          as described below. The efficacy of each ligand was
          defined <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as percent</NUMEX> inhibition of forskolin stimulated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cAMP</ENAMEX> production compared to no ligand levels (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0%</NUMEX>
          inhibition, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> cAMP production).
        
        
          Antagonism
          Compounds with very little 
          in vitro agonistic activity
          (<<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> inhibition of cAMP production) for which the
          dose response curves could not be fitted, were tested for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antagonism</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Antagonists</ENAMEX> were identified as ligands that
          were able to repeatedly block the inhibitory effect of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
          nM etorphine on forskolin stimulated cAMP production. In
          these assays, antagonist was added to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> along
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IBMX</ENAMEX>. After <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15 minutes</TIMEX> of incubation, the agonist
          was added and the cells were incubated with both ligands
          for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">an additional 10 minutes</TIMEX>. After addition of
          forskolin, the cells were incubated for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> additional
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes</TIMEX>. The rest of the assay was as described
          above.
        
        
          Curve fitting
          The analysis of ligand activity was performed using
          PRISM software (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GraphPad Software, Inc.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego</ENAMEX>, CA). A
          computer-generated "best fit" of non-linear regression
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> was used to provide estimate of IC 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> . Dose response data generated by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cAMP</ENAMEX> enzyme immunoassay (EIA) system were fitted with the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> site competition function.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> processing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> from each dose response curve were normalized to
          the top of the respective curve. The normalized data from
          multiple dose response curves were combined and a new
          dose response curve was fitted to the combined data and
          maximal inhibition was determined for the combined data.
          IC 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> values presented are the mean Â± SEM
          of IC

          from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Life Technologies</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockville</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MD</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DPDPE</ENAMEX> was
          obtained from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peninsula Laboratories</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">San</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carlos</ENAMEX>, CA),
          and [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3H</TIMEX>]-DPDPE was from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Multiple Peptide Systems</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">San</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diego</ENAMEX>, CA). All other reagents were of analytical grade
          from standard commercial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>.
          All ligands used were prepared as <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> mM stock
          solutions in water except WIN <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44,441</NUMEX>, which was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> mM. All
          ligands were dissolved in distilled <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> except
          cyclazocine, dezocine, etorphine, which were dissolved in
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX>. For the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> dissolved in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX>, the
          final concentration of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethanol</ENAMEX> was <<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.01%</NUMEX> which had no
          affect on the assays performed.
        
        
          Statistical analysis
          Maximal inhibitory effect of each ligand was compared
          to the levels of maximal inhibition by met-enkephalin,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">metazocine</ENAMEX> and morphine using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANOVA</ENAMEX> analysis with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dunnett</ENAMEX>'s multiple comparison as post test using PRISM
          software (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GraphPad Software, Inc.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego</ENAMEX>, CA).
          Significant difference between the inhibitory effects of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> ligands was determined whenever p < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX>.
