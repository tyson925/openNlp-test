        Carcinoma of cervix uteri (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cervical cancer</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX>) is a
        leading cause of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer-related</ENAMEX> mortality in women
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">worldwide</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX> arises by distinct morphologic
        changes from normal epithelium and progresses to carcinoma
        through a series of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">well-defined preinvasive lesions</ENAMEX>.
        Histologically, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX> presents as either squamous cell
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">carcinoma</ENAMEX> (SCC) or adenocarcinoma (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AC</ENAMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] with SCC
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">predominating</ENAMEX>. Converging evidence from epidemiological and
        molecular studies suggests that infection of genital human
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">papillomavirus</ENAMEX> (HPV) is causally linked to the development
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . Since only a small fraction of HPV-infected
        cervical intra-epithelial neoplastic (CIN) lesions progress
        to invasive <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>, these studies further suggest that in
        addition to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPV</ENAMEX>, other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> genetic factors play a role in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cervical carcinogenesis</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . A number of molecular
        studies have identified genetic alterations in these two
        histologic types of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX> and at various stages of precursor
        lesions [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7 8</NUMEX> ] . Despite this molecular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">characterization</ENAMEX>, the genetic basis of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX> initiation and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">progression</ENAMEX> is still very poorly understood. Therefore,
        identification of the underlying genetic changes may
        provide further insight into the molecular basis of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX>.
        Epigenetic hypermethylation in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> regions of a
        number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> has been recognized as an important change
        in the development of human cancer [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . A growing number
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cancer-related genes</ENAMEX> have been identified to harbor
        methylation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cytosine residues</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">CpG</ENAMEX>-rich promoter
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX>. The pattern of such <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">promoter methylation</ENAMEX> has
        been noted to be non-random in various tumor types, while
        certain genes are commonly methylated in diverse tumor
        types [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11</NUMEX> ] . The extent of aberrant promoter
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypermethylation</ENAMEX> and its association with loss of gene
        function in cancer suggests that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">CpG</ENAMEX> island methylation is
        an important mechanism in inactivating <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX> suppressor
        genes (TSGs).
        The role of epigenetic gene inactivation in cervical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tumorigenesis</ENAMEX> is poorly understood. A few previously
        published reports on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX> and its precursor <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> showed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter methylation</ENAMEX> of specific genes [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13</NUMEX> ] . However,
        these studies were limited by the small number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and
        tumors examined. To investigate the role of promoter
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">methylation</ENAMEX> in detail in cervical tumorigenesis, we
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">evaluated CpG</ENAMEX> methylation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">90</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX> specimens
        and cell lines. We found <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">86.6%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> exhibiting
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter methylation</ENAMEX>. The 
        CDH1 , 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAPK</ENAMEX> , 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RARB</ENAMEX> , and 
        HIC1 gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> were frequently
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">methylated</ENAMEX>. Methylation status was correlated with clinical
        and histologic characteristics, and microsatellite
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">instability</ENAMEX> (MSI). We also found evidence that promoter
        methylation inactivates gene expression in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX> and exposure
        to methylation and/or histone deacetylase (HDAC)-inhibiting
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> reactivate the gene expression.

          hypermethylation was not found in the DNA isolated from
          normal cervical smears for any of the tested genes.
          However, hypermethylation was detected in one or more

          the patterns are similar, primary tumors had a higher
          frequency of methylation of 
          CDH1 and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DAPK genes</ENAMEX> as compared to cell

          Analyses of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPV</ENAMEX> and microsatellite
          instability
          Eighty-six of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">90</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95.6%</NUMEX>) tumors were positive for HPV
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>. The remaining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> tumors were HPV negative. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPV</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>
          alone or in combination with other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">types</ENAMEX> was found in
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">55</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">61.1%</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPV</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> was found in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">eight</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.9%</NUMEX>) tumors,
          while other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">types</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> different types) in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25.6%</NUMEX>)
          tumors.
          Of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">82</TIMEX> primary tumors studied for promoter
          methylation, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</NUMEX> tumors were also examined for
          microsatellite instability (MSI) using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">49</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">di</ENAMEX>- or
          tetra-nucleotide markers [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15 16 17</NUMEX> ] . We found <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> of
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">18.8%</NUMEX>) tumors had MSI-H, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">48</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">18.8%</NUMEX>) tumors
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">exhibited MSI-L</ENAMEX> phenotype. The remaining tumors did not
          show <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSI</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Promoter hypermethylation</ENAMEX> in relation to
          histological, clinical and genetic characteristics
          To evaluate the relationship between promoter
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypermethylation</ENAMEX> and clinico-pathologic features, as well
          as other genetic changes, methylation status was
          correlated with histology, age, stage and size of the
          tumor, clinical outcome, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPV</ENAMEX> type, and microsatellite
          instability. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2shows</ENAMEX> the results of univariate
          analyses examining the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> between methylation
          and these characteristics. Although both squamous cell
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">carcinoma</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCC</ENAMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">85.7%</NUMEX>) and adenocarcinoma (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AC</ENAMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX>)
          exhibited an overall high rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter methylation</ENAMEX>,
          we found statistically significant differences in various
          genes in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these two histologic subsets</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). Promoter
          methylation of the 
          CDH1 , 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RARB</ENAMEX> , 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FHIT</ENAMEX> , and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MGMT genes</ENAMEX> was noted only in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCC</ENAMEX>,
          whereas the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AC</ENAMEX> exhibited significantly higher frequency
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter methylation</ENAMEX> of 
          HIC1 (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60%</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AC</ENAMEX> vs. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15.6%</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCC</ENAMEX>), 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APC</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AC</ENAMEX> vs. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6.5%</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCC</ENAMEX>),
          and 
          BRCA1 (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40%</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AC</ENAMEX> vs. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.9%</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCC</ENAMEX>)
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>).
          A significant correlation was observed between the
          overall frequency of methylation and the tumor stage (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> =
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.001</NUMEX>). Higher stage (stages <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II-IV</ENAMEX>) tumors exhibited an
          increased overall frequency of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> methylation
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). However, the differences were not
          statistically significant when individual genes examined.
          On the other hand, 
          RASSF1A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">methylation</ENAMEX> was associated
          with low-grade tumors (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.003</NUMEX>). Tumor size has no
          effect on the overall frequency of methylation. Age also
          has no influence on overall frequency of promoter
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">methylation</ENAMEX>. However, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RARB</ENAMEX> gene was more frequently
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">methylated</ENAMEX> in younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">34.7%</NUMEX> in below 50 years
          and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">21.2%</NUMEX> in above <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50 years age</TIMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.02</NUMEX>). Promoter
          methylation of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APC</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.0%</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> below <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> vs. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">24.2%</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> above <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50 years age</TIMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX>=
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.001</NUMEX>) and 
          BRCA1 (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.1%</NUMEX> in below <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50 years</TIMEX> and
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9.1%</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> above <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50 years</TIMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were
          significantly higher in older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
          In order to assess the prognostic role, we also
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">correlated</ENAMEX> treatment response and clinical outcome with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter methylation</ENAMEX>. The overall frequency of
          methylation was higher in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who died of cancer
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOC</ENAMEX>) (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95.3%</NUMEX>) as compared to those who were alive with

          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.015</NUMEX>). Although statistically not significant, all
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> whose tumors showed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter methylation</ENAMEX> of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGMT</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4 tumors</ENAMEX>) and

          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1-21 months</TIMEX> of follow-up after the initial diagnosis.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Promoter methylation</ENAMEX> of the remaining <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> did not show
          such differences in relation to the outcome. To assess
          the role of radiation and/or chemotherapy treatment on
          outcome, we correlated methylation with response in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at least 5 months</TIMEX> follow up after
          treatment. No significant differences in the overall
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter methylation</ENAMEX> were found in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with complete
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">remission</ENAMEX> (CR) compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who DOC or had only
          partial response (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PR</ENAMEX>). In this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, all the patients
          that showed methylation of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGMT</ENAMEX> and 
          BRCA1 genes failed to respond to
          the treatment suggesting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter methylation</ENAMEX> of these
          genes may be a bad prognostic indicator (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Promoter methylation</ENAMEX> of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RARB</ENAMEX> gene was also predicted a
          worse prognosis <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as 80%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with methylation
          were either <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DOC</ENAMEX> or only partial responders compared to

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3summarizes</ENAMEX> the results from multivariate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cox</ENAMEX>
          Survival models. Overall, after adjusting for age,
          treatment, tumor size, stage and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPV</ENAMEX> type, neither total
          number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methylated genes</ENAMEX> nor presence of methylation of
          each specific gene were statistically significantly
          related to survival. However, methylation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> did
          suggest a doubling ( 
          RASSF1A and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGMT</ENAMEX> ) or tripling ( 
          BRCA1 ) of risk compared to those
          who did not have these genes methylated. These
          differences were not statistically significant due to
          small number of tumors analyzed and need to be confirmed
          using a larger sample size.
          Type of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HPV</ENAMEX> infection had no association with the
          status of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter methylation</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). Although the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSI</ENAMEX> phenotype also had no significant correlation with
          overall promoter methylation, the 
          HIC1 (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.02</NUMEX>) and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APC</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.08</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were
          frequently methylated in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> exhibiting MSI-H
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenotype</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          CDH1 and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RARB</ENAMEX> expression in CIN
          To examine the role of 
          CDH1 and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RARB genes</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX> progression, we
          carried out immunohistochemical analysis in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> CIN
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">specimens</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nine</ENAMEX> low-grade and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> high-grade). None of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">low-grade CINs</ENAMEX> showed down-regulated expression, while
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 2</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">30</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6.7%</NUMEX>) showed absent or reduced expression
          suggesting that 
          CDH1 inactivation is a later event
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX> development. The expression pattern of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RARB</ENAMEX> in
          normal epithelium is complex since the staining
          intensities are highly variable between nuclear and
          cytoplasmic compartments. There was no normal epithelium
          to evaluate the expression in most CIN cases studied.
          However, all the cases that we evaluated for RARB
          immunoreactivity showed some positive mesenchymal cells.
          We evaluated the intensity of nuclear staining in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX>
          cases of paraffin-embedded tissues. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11.1%</NUMEX>) of the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> low-grade <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CINs</ENAMEX> showed decreased nuclear expression,
          whereas, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60%</NUMEX>) of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> evaluable high-grade <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">CIN lesions</ENAMEX>
          showed complete lack of nuclear expression (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). If
          confirmed, the down-regulated RARB expression in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">high-grade CINs</ENAMEX> suggests that this occurs early in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">progression</ENAMEX> and plays a role in the development of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Gene expression is down regulated by promoter
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypermethylation</ENAMEX> and reactivated by demethylation
          To examine the biological role of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> methylation
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX>, we assessed the levels of mRNA by
          semi-quantitative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> cell lines and compared
          with the respective control values obtained from the
          averages calculated from <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 normal cervix</TIMEX> after
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">normalization</ENAMEX> against 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACTB</ENAMEX> . This analysis was performed
          on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (

          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RARB</ENAMEX> gene showed either complete
          absence of or down regulated expression in all cell lines
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">6 methylated and 2 unmethylated</NUMEX>). Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> lines
          with 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RARB</ENAMEX> gene methylated, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HT-3</ENAMEX>,
          MS751, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ME-180</ENAMEX>) exhibited reactivation upon treatment
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5-Aza-2</ENAMEX>' deoxycytidine or n-butyrate alone or the
          combination of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> cell lines (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C4-I</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">CaSki</ENAMEX>,
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SW756</ENAMEX>) that had promoter methylation of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RARB</ENAMEX> did not reactivate expression
          after treatment with these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the two
          unmethylated cell lines also reactivated the expression
          of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RARB</ENAMEX> .
          The 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDH</ENAMEX> gene exhibited a complete
          absence of expression in one cell line (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">SW756</NUMEX>) that
          showed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter hypermethylation</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> other cell lines
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-33A</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SiHa</ENAMEX>) without evidence of methylation (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">SW756</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> line with methylation and one of the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> unmethylated cell lines showed reactivated expression
          upon treatment with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5-Aza-2</ENAMEX>' deoxycytidine or in
          combination with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">n-butyrate</NUMEX>, but not with n-butyrate
          alone. The remaining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> cell lines neither showed
          evidence of decreased mRNA nor any effect of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">demethylating</ENAMEX> or HDAC-inhibiting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> on expression
          levels.
          The 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAPK</ENAMEX> gene showed a complete absence
          of expression in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> and down regulated expression in
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">8 CC</ENAMEX> cell lines studied (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>
          cell lines with down regulated expression, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> had promoter
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">methylation</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> had unmethylated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAPK</ENAMEX> gene. Both methylated cell
          lines (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HT-3</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SiHa</ENAMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-33A</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MS751</TIMEX>, and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ME-180</ENAMEX>) of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> unmethylated cell lines showed
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reactivation</ENAMEX> upon exposure to <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5-Aza-2</ENAMEX>' deoxycytidine or
          in combination with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">n-butyrate</NUMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the unmethylated
          cell lines (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">SW756</NUMEX>) that showed a complete absence of
          expression did not reactivate after treatment.
          The 
          HIC1 gene was methylated in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>
          cell lines. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> of the methylated cell lines (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-4I</ENAMEX>,
          SiHa, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ME-180</ENAMEX>) and one of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> unmethylated cell
          lines (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">MS751</NUMEX>) showed down regulated expression. Treatment
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5-Aza-2</ENAMEX>' deoxycytidine or n-butyrate alone or the
          combination of both activated gene expression in all the
          cell lines, whether or not <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> had detectable
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">methylation</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>).
          The 
          RASSF1A gene was methylated in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
          cell lines and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> showed a complete lack of
          expression. None of the unmethylated cell lines showed
          evidence of down-regulated expression of 
          RASSF1A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mRNA</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> of three cell
          lines with 
          RASSF1A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">methylation</ENAMEX> and complete

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5-Aza-2</ENAMEX>' deoxycytidine alone or in combination with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX>-butyrate. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the methylated cell lines (HT-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>),
          however, did not reactivate gene expression after
          treatment. The unmethylated cell lines showed normal
          expression and the treatment had no effect on
          expression.
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGMT</ENAMEX> was methylated in two cell
          lines. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> methylated cell lines (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CaSki</ENAMEX>)
          showed a complete absence of expression while the other

          deacetylating inhibitor did not activate the expression
          in any cell line regardless of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter methylation</ENAMEX>. 
          MLH1 gene was methylated in one
          cell line (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">SW756</NUMEX>) but we found no evidence of
          down-regulated expression in this cell line (data not

        Discussion
        Genetic alterations play an important role in the
        development of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 7 8</NUMEX> ] . Our extensive molecular
        analyses identified a number of specific genetic changes in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">invasive</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX> and its precursor <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 14 15 16 17 18 19</NUMEX>
        ] . However, epigenetic alteration in cervical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tumorigenesis</ENAMEX> is not well characterized [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13</NUMEX> ] . In the
        present study, we identified an overall methylation in
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">87.8%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CC</ENAMEX> cases. Previous studies by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dong et al</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">79%</NUMEX>) and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Virmani et al</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">72.4%</NUMEX>) have also reported a similar overall
        high frequency of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter methylation</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13</NUMEX> ] . We
        identified promoter methylation in ><NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX> cases in 
        CDH1 , 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAPK</ENAMEX> , and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RARB genes</ENAMEX>, while it was less
        frequent (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10-25%</NUMEX> cases) in 
        HIC1 , 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FHIT</ENAMEX> , 
        RASSF1A , and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">APC genes</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> of 
        CDKN2A , 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGMT</ENAMEX> , 
        BRCA1 , 
        TP73 , 
        TIMP3 , 
        GSTP1 , and 
        MLH1 genes were rarely (<<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX>
        cases) methylated.
        
        CDH1 is the most commonly methylated
        gene in the present study showing promoter methylation in
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">51.1%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX> cases. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dong</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">co-workers</ENAMEX> have shown earlier
        that the 
        CDH1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> is methylated in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">28%</NUMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">invasive</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . E-cadherin, 
        CDH1 , is a major adhesion component
        of epithelial cells, which plays an important role as an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">invasion</ENAMEX> suppressor gene. Loss of function of 
        CDH1 gene has been shown to occur in
        widespread of epithelial tumor types by mutational or
        promoter hypermethylation mechanisms [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 20</NUMEX> ] . We have
        also identified loss of expression of 
        CDH1 gene in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">37.5%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX> cell lines
        analyzed. Thus, these data suggest that inactivation of the
        
        CDH1 gene by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> methylation
        plays a major role in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX> tumorigenesis. However, our
        immunohistochemical analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cadherin protein</ENAMEX> showed
        no evidence of decreased expression in precursor CIN
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX>. Therefore, these data indicate that the
        methylation of 
        CDH1 gene is a late event in the
        development of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX>.
        
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAPK</ENAMEX> gene is methylated in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">43.3%</NUMEX>
        cases in the present study. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dong</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">co-workers</ENAMEX> also
        previously showed promoter methylation in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">51%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ]
        . 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAPK</ENAMEX> is a positive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediator</ENAMEX> of the
        programmed cell death induced by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma-interferon</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] .
        Loss of 
        DAPK expression has been shown to
        occur in a number of human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">malignancies</ENAMEX>, primarily by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter hypermethylation</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . It has also been shown
        that loss of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAPK</ENAMEX> gene expression was associated
        with aggressive and metastatic phenotype in many tumor
        types [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . In the present study, in addition to showing
        high frequency of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter methylation</ENAMEX> of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAPK</ENAMEX> gene, we found a complete lack
        of expression in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of the methylated cell lines and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
        of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> unmethylated cell lines. Thus, our results suggest
        that loss of expression occurs in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX> cell lines by
        mechanism other than complete <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">promoter methylation</ENAMEX>.
        Therefore, our data further suggest a role for 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAPK</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX> tumorigenesis.
        The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> most commonly methylated gene in the present
        study is 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RARB</ENAMEX> . A previous study also has
        reported promoter methylation in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">33.3%</NUMEX> of invasive <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX>, and
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11% and 29%</NUMEX> of low- and high-grade <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">CIN lesions</ENAMEX>,
        respectively [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> suggest that 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RARB</ENAMEX> methylation is an early event in
        multistage cervical carcinogenesis. Our semi-quantitative
        analysis of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RARB</ENAMEX> gene expression by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> showed
        down-regulated expression in all the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> cell lines
        analyzed whether or not the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter methylated</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>).
        In addition, our immunohistochemical analysis of RARB
        showed lack of expression in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60%</NUMEX> of high-grade <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CINs</ENAMEX>. It has
        been reported that 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RARB</ENAMEX> mRNA is down regulated in a
        number of tumor types [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] , including cervical <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> ] . Taken together, these data support the concept that 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RARB</ENAMEX> play an important role early in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cervical cancer</ENAMEX> progression. The direct role of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RARB</ENAMEX> in regulating gene expression
        and its retinoid-mediated antiproliferative,
        differentiative, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">immuno-modulatory</ENAMEX>, and apoptotic-inducing
        properties may offer a therapeutic target in the future for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX> treatment [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] .
        As reported in a previous study, we also found promoter
        methylation of 
        HIC1 in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">22.2%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . 
        HIC1 is a zinc finger transcription
        factor that is transcriptionally silenced by promoter
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">methylation</ENAMEX> in several types of human cancer [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] .

        of wild type allele develop carcinomas, sarcomas and
        lymphomas, suggesting that this gene acts as a tumor
        suppressor gene [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . 
        HIC1 gene was down regulated in
        majority of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX> cell lines examined by us and this
        down-regulated expression was reactivated upon treatment
        with demethylating and HDAC-inhibiting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>. These
        results support the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX> suppressor role of 
        HIC1 and its inactivation by promoter
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">methylation</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX> may be a critical epigenetic change in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX> development.
        The present methylation profile of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX> identified
        significant differences in the methylated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCC</ENAMEX>
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AC</ENAMEX>. We found that methylation of 
        HIC1 , 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APC</ENAMEX> , and 
        BRACA1 genes was more common in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AC</ENAMEX>
        while 
        CDH1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter methylation</ENAMEX> was seen
        only in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCC</ENAMEX>. Such differences in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> major histologies
        have also been reported previously for 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAPK</ENAMEX> , 
        HIC1 , and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">APC genes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . However, we found 
        CDH1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> methylation restricted
        to SCC in the present study, while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dong et al</ENAMEX> found
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">methylation</ENAMEX> in both histological types [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . This
        difference may be due to small number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> we
        studied. Distinct patterns of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> methylation between
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AC</ENAMEX>, however, suggest that epigenetic pathways of
        tumor suppression may be different in these histologic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subtypes</ENAMEX>. Contrary to the previous reports, we found a low
        frequency of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">p16/</ENAMEX>CDKN2A gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> methylation
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13 28 29</NUMEX> ] . The reason for these differences is
        currently unclear.
        Our statistical correlative analysis of promoter
        methylation with clinicopathologic parameters, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPV</ENAMEX> type,
        and microsatellite instability identified significant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associations</ENAMEX>. A most significant finding was that overall
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter hypermethylation</ENAMEX> is associated with the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">progression</ENAMEX> and predicts significantly poor disease-free
        survival. This was most evident in 
        BRCA1 and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MGMT genes</ENAMEX>, where all the patients
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter methylation</ENAMEX> were dead (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">multivariate Cox</ENAMEX> regression analysis showed that promoter
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">methylation</ENAMEX> is an independent predictor of outcome for 
        BRCA1 (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-fold risk) and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGMT</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.3</NUMEX> fold risk) genes. Promoter
        methylation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cancer-related genes</ENAMEX> has been reported to
        predict patient prognosis for a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30 31</NUMEX> ] .
        
        BRCA1 plays a critical role in DNA
        repair and recombination, cell cycle checkpoint control,
        and transcription. This gene has been shown to be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypermethylated</ENAMEX> in tumors arising from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast</ENAMEX>-ovarian
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer syndrome</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] . Although we detected complete
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter methylation</ENAMEX> of 
        BRCA1 gene in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 6%</NUMEX> of primary
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tumors</ENAMEX>, other mechanisms that inactivate this gene might
        exist. The present <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSP</ENAMEX> data and its relation to poor
        clinical outcome warrants a further study of 
        BRCA1 role in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX>. 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGMT</ENAMEX> gene encodes
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6</ENAMEX>)-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">methylguanine</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA methyltransferase</ENAMEX> and this enzyme
        effectively removes <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA adducts</ENAMEX> formed by alkylating agents
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] . Epigenetic gene silencing of 
        MGMT confers enhanced sensitivity to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">alkylating</ENAMEX>-based chemotherapy, and lack of methylation
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">associates</ENAMEX> with failure to respond to chemotherapy [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34 35</NUMEX>
        ] . On the contrary, all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> that had 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGMT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter methylation</ENAMEX> were dead
        within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21 months</TIMEX> of initial diagnosis, which predicts a
        poor prognosis. A possible explanation for this failure to
        respond may be that all the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in the present
        study were treated only with radiotherapy with or without
        combination of surgery. The standard treatment for
        advanced-stage cervix <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> has been the combination of
        radical surgery and radiotherapy [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] . The utility of
        cytotoxic chemotherapy in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with advanced <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX> has
        been recognized recently [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] . Thus, the epigenetic gene
        silencing of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MGMT</ENAMEX> , although in a small
        proportion, may serve as indicator of responsiveness to
        treatment with chemotherapeutic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> that cause DNA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adducts</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX>.
        Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in the present study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> were
        treated with traditional radiation and surgery treatment
        protocols. To assess the impact of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> methylation on
        treatment, we compared the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> followed for more than
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5 months</TIMEX> after treatment. This analysis suggests that 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RARB</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">methylation</ENAMEX> predict a worse
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">prognosis</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.02</NUMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twelve</NUMEX> of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RARB</ENAMEX> methylation were DOC or did not
        respond to the current treatment, while <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 3</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>
        (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RARB</ENAMEX> methylation exhibited complete
        response. Since 
        RARB functions as a <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor</ENAMEX> suppressor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX> and its chemopreventive effects are purely based on
        retinoid induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reactivation</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> that received
        radiation therapy will have no effect on these tumors. Our
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>, therefore, suggest that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> showing 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RARB</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter methylation</ENAMEX> may benefit
        from targeted chemopreventive treatment of combination of
        retinoic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>, demethylating, and chromatin modifying
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> that reactivate the gene expression. An
        understanding of the exact mechanisms of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RARB</ENAMEX> loss of function in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX> is
        essential for such a strategy.
        Microsatellite instability (MSI) is hallmark of mismatch
        repair-deficient <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX>, which has been observed in all
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX> arising from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hereditary Non-polyposis Colorectal</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Cancer</ENAMEX> (HNPCC) syndrome, some sporadic colorectal and other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSI</ENAMEX> is generally associated with germ-line
        mutations in one of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MMR genes</ENAMEX>, 
        hMLH1 and 
        hMSH2 . Epigenetic inactivation of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter hypermethylation</ENAMEX> of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APC</ENAMEX> and 
        HIC1 also results in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSI</ENAMEX> phenotype in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sporadic colorectal cancers</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39 40</NUMEX> ] . Accumulating
        evidence supports the view that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter methylation</ENAMEX> of
        mismatch repair genes may be related to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">phenotype</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42</NUMEX> ] . A number of previous studies have shown the
        existence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSI</ENAMEX> phenotype in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43 44</NUMEX> ] . In the present
        study, we found that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSI</ENAMEX>-H occurs at an increased frequency
        in tumors with 
        HIC1 and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter hypermethylation</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Association of</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter methylation</ENAMEX> with MSI
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phonotype</ENAMEX> has been previously reported in endometrial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX> ] . Although the significance of these results
        is currently unclear, we believe that inactivation of these
        genes by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> methylation causes microsatellite
        instability and may contribute to the development of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX>.
        Aberrant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> methylation changes that occur in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> are associated with transcriptional repression and
        loss of function of the methylated gene [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . Since we
        found evidence of down-regulated expression of several
        methylated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX> cell lines, we tested to see if this
        down-regulation could be reactivated by methylation and
        HDAC-inhibiting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>. Transcriptional silencing of genes
        resulting from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> hypermethylation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CpG</ENAMEX> islands is
        reversed by treatment with the hypo-methylating agent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5-aza-2</ENAMEX>'-deoxycytidine and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HDAC-inhibiting agent n</ENAMEX>-butyrate
        in a dose and duration-dependent manner. We found that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5-Aza-2</ENAMEX>'-deoxycytidine treatment alone or in combination
        with n-butyrate resulted in reactivation of gene expression
        in most cell lines that showed promoter methylation. In
        some cell lines, exposure to n-butyrate alone has resulted
        in reactivation of the gene expression, for example in 
        HIC1 gene (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). These data,
        therefore, suggest that other epigenetic mechanisms
        involving defects in chromatin modification factors such as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">acetylation</ENAMEX> and methylation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">histone proteins</ENAMEX> may also
        play role in gene silencing. Thus, our data also suggest
        that epigenetic changes that accompany <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">methylation</ENAMEX> are
        common in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX> and play critical role in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX> development.
      
      
        Conclusions
        The present study identified promoter methylation in a
        number of genes in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX>. The most frequently methylated genes
        were 
        CDH1 , 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAPK</ENAMEX> , 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RARB</ENAMEX> , and 
        HIC1 . We have also shown that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter methylation</ENAMEX> of these genes result in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">transcriptional</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">repression</ENAMEX>. Furthermore, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RARB</ENAMEX> gene expression is down
        regulated in high-grade <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CINs</ENAMEX>. These data suggest that some
        of the methylated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> may play a role early in the
        progression of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>. Here we showed that promoter
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">methylation</ENAMEX> is associated with advanced stage of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RARB</ENAMEX> and 
        BRCA1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter methylation</ENAMEX> predict a
        worse prognosis, and the 
        HIC1 and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter methylation</ENAMEX> is
        frequently associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MSI</ENAMEX>. This knowledge of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epigenetic</ENAMEX> changes in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX> may have implications in our
        understanding of the role they play in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX> development.
        Particularly, if the present results are replicated and
        identified in precancerous <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX>, this may be useful in
        predicting the high-risk <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> to progression and serve
        as targets of treatment.

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX>, Tumor tissues, and cell lines
          A total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">82</NUMEX> tumor biopsies derived from previously
          untreated primary invasive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CCs</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> cell lines were
          used. The tumor biopsies were ascertained from patients
          evaluated at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Instituto Nacional de Cancerologia</ENAMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Fe de Bogota</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colombia</ENAMEX>) and from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of</ENAMEX>

          were classified as squamous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell carcinoma</ENAMEX> (SCC) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>
          as adenocarcinoma (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AC</ENAMEX>). Clinical information such as age,
          stage and size of the tumor, follow-up after treatment
          was collected for all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. Patient follow-up data
          was collected from the review of institutional medical

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> after
          appropriate informed consent. Cell <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">pellets</ENAMEX> obtained from
          the swabs were used to isolate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CC</ENAMEX> cell lines <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">SiHa</ENAMEX>,

          Carpenteria, CA) system, using diaminobenzidine as a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chromogen</ENAMEX>. Tumors were considered positive for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E-</ENAMEX>cadherin
          when cells showed membrane staining. For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RARB</ENAMEX>, staining
          in normal epithelium either nuclear or cytoplasmic or
          both were considered positive. Normal epithelium and

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">demographic</ENAMEX>, and genetic characteristics using <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chi-Square</ENAMEX>
          test [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">55</TIMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fisher</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Exact</ENAMEX> test (for small cell
          counts) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">56</TIMEX> ] . Characteristics that we examined
          included: histology, stage, tumor size, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s age,
          clinical outcome, treatment response, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPV</ENAMEX> type, and
          microsatellite instability. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cox Proportional Hazard</ENAMEX>
          Models [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">57</TIMEX> ] were further applied to assess the relative
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">hazard</ENAMEX> (risk) of dying associated with each methylated
          gene after adjusting for age, treatment status, tumor
          size, stage, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPV</ENAMEX> type.
