        During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last two decades</TIMEX>, the contribution of specialized
        mesenchymal cells, i.e., fibroblast-derived vascular
        pericytes, monocyte-derived cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MDC</ENAMEX>), and lymphocytes,
        to the proliferation, differentiation, and aging of
        tissue-specific cells in various epithelial, parenchymal,
        and muscle tissues has gained increasing interest [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1, 2,</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10</ENAMEX>]. Recent developments in the
        understanding of the role of mesenchymal cells and their
        products in regulation of proliferation and differentiation
        of tissue cells were initiated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than seventy years ago</TIMEX>,
        when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alexis</ENAMEX> Carrel demonstrated that leukocyte extracts,
        like embryonic tissue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">extracts</ENAMEX>, stimulate multiplication of
        fibroblasts 
        in vitro, and suggested that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">leukocytes</ENAMEX> can bring growth- activating <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substances</ENAMEX> to
        tissue-specific cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>]. Later, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s and 1970s</TIMEX>,
        lymphocytes were shown to promote tissue growth and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">regeneration</ENAMEX> (reviewed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ref.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>]). In spite of these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">achievements</ENAMEX>, our understanding of the interactions between
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mesenchymal</ENAMEX> and tissue-specific cells is still in its
        beginning. While a lot of work has been done on the role of
        various growth factors and cytokines produced by
        mesenchymal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> on the cell cycle and death 
        in vitro [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18</TIMEX>],
        little is known about interactions between mesenchymal and
        tissue-specific cells 
        in vivo. 
        The role of mesenchymal cells in homeostasis of normal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tissues</ENAMEX> (and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>) is still poorly understood. Our
        studies [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2, 9, 10</ENAMEX>], and those of others [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3, 4, 5, 6,</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7, 8</ENAMEX>], demonstrate that the interaction between mesenchymal
        cells and tissue-specific cells is complex. The nature of
        the interactions may depend on the tissue type, e.g.,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">liver</ENAMEX>, brain and muscle with very long lived differentiated
        cells, vs. epidermis, ectocervix and vagina, where cells
        growth and die at a relatively rapid rate. Alternatively,
        it may depend on the prevention ("stop effect") or
        allowance/stimulation of differentiation of cells into the
        suicidal <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> (apoptosis) by mesenchymal cells in a given
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epithelium</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>]. The relationship of mesenchymal and
        epithelial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> appears to be tissue-specific and
        established during the critical period of development,
        which coincides with the end of the immune adaptation [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>].
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Specialized</ENAMEX> mesenchymal cells, such as pericytes, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MDC</ENAMEX> and T
        lymphocytes, may significantly influence the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentiation</ENAMEX> and aging of epithelial cells. The extent
        to which epithelial cells are stimulated to differentiate
        by mesenchymal cells is dependent on the extent to which
        the particular tissue differentiates during the critical
        period of development [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>]. We have also suggested that
        advanced differentiation of epithelial cells may require
        certain cytokines released from T cells and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DC</ENAMEX> undergoing
        suicide [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>].
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">terminal stage</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell differentiation</ENAMEX> is apoptosis,
        during which cells undergo DNA fragmentation and die.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apoptosis</ENAMEX> is an active process, and it is induced by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p53</TIMEX>,
        which inhibits cell growth and activates and represses gene
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcription</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>]. Proapoptotic function of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p53</TIMEX> appears
        to be regulated by 
        ras proto-oncogene. Cells transformed
        with mutated 
        ras exhibit a defect in the signal
        transduction pathway regulating <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">p53</NUMEX> function and alteration
        in the expression of apoptotic (bax) or anti-apoptotic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">bcl-2</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>].
        In human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ectocervix</ENAMEX>, the interactions between cells of
        mesenchymal origin and these of epithelial origin change
        when examined in a cross section from the basal (immature)
        layer, where stem cells reside, to the outermost layers,
        where the epithelial cells are oldest and highest
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">differentiated</ENAMEX>. Hence the ectocervix represents a suitable
        model for the investigation of mesenchymal cell association
        with the differentiating and aging epithelial cells 
        in vivo. 
        The data presented here indicate that phylogenetically
        and ontogenetically developed hierarchy of mesenchymal
        cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MDC</ENAMEX>, pericytes, T cells) and immunoglobulins (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IgM</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IgG</ENAMEX>) accompanies differentiation of epithelial cells from
        immature into the mature and aged <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">phenotype</TIMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intraepithelial T</ENAMEX> lymphocytes and mature <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DC</ENAMEX> exhibit
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">suicide</ENAMEX>, and immunoglobulins are associated with aging and
        apoptosis of epithelial cells.
      
      
        Results and discussion
        
          Mesenchymal cells
          The stratified epithelium of uterine ectocervix
          consists of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> layers of epithelial cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1A).
          The basal layer ( 
          b ) is formed by a single row of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">basal</ENAMEX> or stem cells. Parabasal layer ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pb</ENAMEX> ) is formed by several layers of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">parabasal</ENAMEX> (young) epithelial cells. Intermediate layer ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">im</ENAMEX> ) consists of multiple layers of
          mature epithelial cells. Superficial layer ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX> ) is formed by several layers of
          aged cells. These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> morphologically distinct layers
          are divided by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three interfaces</NUMEX> - b/pb, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pb</ENAMEX>/im, and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">im</ENAMEX>/s
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interface</ENAMEX>. The parabasal and intermediate layers can be
          divided into the lower, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid</TIMEX>, and upper layers, the
          superficial layer into the lower and upper layers.
          Mesenchymal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> are present in the lamina propria
          and some invade among epithelial cells. Staining for CD14
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1A) shows small primitive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MDC</ENAMEX> in lamina propria but
          not within the epithelium. Detail, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1B, shows
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD14</NUMEX> cells with the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">basement membrane</ENAMEX> and
          extension among basal epithelial cells. Recent study has
          shown that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD14</TIMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">lipopolysaccharide</ENAMEX> receptor, is itself
          involved in the stimulation of cell proliferation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>].
          Similar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of CD14 primitive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MDC</ENAMEX> with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">proliferating Ki67</ENAMEX> epithelial cells was detected in
          ovarian <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX> (unpublished data). In ectocervix, the
          staining for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ki67</TIMEX> (inset, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1A) shows that this marker
          of proliferation is expressed in the nuclei of parabasal
          cells adjacent to the b/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pb interface</ENAMEX>. This indicates that
          in the stratified epithelium of ectocervix, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ki-67</ENAMEX> is
          still expressed in the postmitotic cells leaving the
          basal layer and entering differentiation.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1Cshows <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staining</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Thy-1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">glycoprotein</ENAMEX>, also
          called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Thy-1</ENAMEX> differentiation <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>], of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fibroblasts</ENAMEX> and pericytes associated with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microvasculature</ENAMEX> (arrows) adjacent to the basement
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">membrane</ENAMEX>. Detail of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Thy-1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">staining</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1D) shows that
          pericytes secrete intercellular vesicles, which migrate
          among basal epithelial cells to the b/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pb interface</ENAMEX>, where
          they collapse into empty <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> ("spikes"). <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1E,
          and detail <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1F</TIMEX>, show that major histocompatibility complex
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHC</ENAMEX>) class I molecules are not expressed by basal
          epithelial cells, but they are strongly expressed
          throughout the parabasal layer, including lower parabasal
          cells. Hence, targets for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Thy-1</ENAMEX> vesicles appear to be
          parabasal cells adjacent to the b/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pb interface</ENAMEX>, i.e.,
          epithelial cells expressing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> I and entering
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentiation</ENAMEX>.
          The intercellular <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Thy-1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vesicles</ENAMEX> have been shown by
          immunoelectron microscopy to exhibit <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Thy-1</ENAMEX> surface
          expression and to contain a substance lacking Thy-1
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">staining</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>]. They may represent a unique paracrine
          mechanism, so called "targeted delivery," by which
          certain growth <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor</ENAMEX> (vesicle content) is delivered by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chemotaxis</ENAMEX> to certain type/stage specific target cells
          expressing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Thy-1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ligand</ENAMEX>. However, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Thy-1</ENAMEX> has not been yet identified.
          Targeted delivery of some growth factors by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intercellular</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Thy-1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vesicles</ENAMEX> can be enabled by tissue
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">specificity of Thy-1</ENAMEX> glycoprotein carbohydrate moieties [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX>]. Thy-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> differentiation <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> consists of a single
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ig</ENAMEX> domain and represents <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the most primitive and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ancestral</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of immunoglobulin (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ig</ENAMEX>) superfamily. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ig</ENAMEX>-related molecules have a diversity of functions, but
          in most cases the common denominator is a recognition at
          the cell surface [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>].
          It has been suggested that the involvement of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ig</ENAMEX>-related molecules in tissue interactions is more
          primitive than their involvement in the immune system and
          the immune functions evolved from the sets of molecules
          mediating tissue interactions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>]. Also, the only
          function of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Thy-1</ENAMEX> and other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ig</ENAMEX>-related molecules is to
          mediate recognition, with the consequences of recognition
          being due to the differentiated state of the cells. It
          requires that the correct ligand and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> are
          expressed on the appropriate cells at the right time [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>].
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> I and class <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">II</ENAMEX> molecules are other members
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ig</ENAMEX> superfamily. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2Ashows that large quantities of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HLA-DR</ENAMEX> molecules are secreted by precursors of dendritic
          cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DC</ENAMEX>) among epithelial cells in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid</TIMEX> parabasal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">layer</ENAMEX> (arrows). This site-specific HLA-DR secretion is
          particularly evident when <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">precursors</ENAMEX> are compared with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inactive MDC</ENAMEX> in lamina propria (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ip</ENAMEX>) or mature <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DC</ENAMEX> in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">intermediate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">epithelial layers</ENAMEX> (arrowheads).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> cells expressing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD8</TIMEX>, which is another <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ig</ENAMEX>
          superfamily, accumulate in lamina propria, enter
          epithelium, and migrate through parabasal epithelial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">layers</ENAMEX> (arrow. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2B) expressing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> I (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1E),
          toward the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pb</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">im interface</ENAMEX> (dashed line). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> cells
          entering lower intermediate layers exhibit fragmentation
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">arrowheads</NUMEX>). No T cells were detected in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid</TIMEX>
          intermediate layers or at the epithelium surface.
          CD68 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">epitope</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MDC</ENAMEX>, mucin-like molecule belonging to
          the lysosomal-associated membrane <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> family [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>],
          was expressed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MDC</ENAMEX> in the lamina propria (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2C).
          However, within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">epithelium</TIMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CD68</NUMEX> appeared during
          transformation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DC</ENAMEX> precursors into mature <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DC</ENAMEX>, in the
          upper parabasal layers (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arrow</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mature DC</ENAMEX> (black
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arrowheads</ENAMEX>) secreted <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CD68</NUMEX> among intermediate epithelial
          cells, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD68</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">mucin</ENAMEX>-like molecules accompanied aging of
          epithelial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> (white arrowheads) including surface
          layers.
          Staining for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD1a</TIMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ig</ENAMEX>-related molecule
          characteristic for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Langerhans</ENAMEX>' cells, was not detected in
          lamina propria (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2D). Dendritic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> precursors
          (arrows) and mature <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DC</ENAMEX> (black arrowheads) were stained.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mature DC</ENAMEX> reaching mid intermediate layers exhibited
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fragmentation</ENAMEX> (white arrowheads) similar to that of T

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1Aand <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2A</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cand</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2D</ENAMEX>, show that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MDC</ENAMEX> associated with
          stratified epithelium of ectocervix exhibit
          differentiation associated with morphological changes and
          show changes in immunohistochemical features.
          Interestingly, although lamina propria of ectocervix
          showed the presence of primitive (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">CD14</NUMEX>) moderately
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HLA-DR</ENAMEX>) and well differentiated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MDC</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">CD68</NUMEX>), the
          monocyte-derived cells entering <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">epithelium</ENAMEX> appear to
          initiate a new differentiation associated with CD1a
          expression and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HLA-DR</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CD68</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">secretion</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Immunoglobulins
          Natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">autoantibodies</ENAMEX> are present in the blood of
          normal healthy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>, and they are almost
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">exclusively IgM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX>, although some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IgG</ENAMEX> and IgA
          natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">autoantibodies</ENAMEX> can also be detected, that bind to
          a variety of self-antigens, including self <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IgG</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4, 27</ENAMEX>].
          When compared to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">IgG</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IgM</ENAMEX> molecules appear earlier in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phylogeny</ENAMEX> and ontogeny [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28, 29</TIMEX>].
          Staining of ectocervical epithelium for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IgM</ENAMEX> is shown
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2E. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Basal</ENAMEX> and lower parabasal layers were
          unstained but IgM binding increased toward the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pb</ENAMEX>/im
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interface</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#1</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2E). In the intermediate layers,
          similar increase of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IgM</ENAMEX> binding was detected toward the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">im/s interface</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#2</NUMEX>). In the superficial layers most
          prominent staining was found at the epithelium surface
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">#3</NUMEX>). Hence, there was a high affinity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IgM</ENAMEX> toward the
          upper cells in the parabasal, intermediate and surface
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">layers</ENAMEX> (white arrowheads).
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IgG</ENAMEX> did not bind to the basal, parabasal or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">intermediate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX>, but showed binding to the entire
          superficial layer (arrowhead, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2F). These data
          indicate that natural autoantibodies exhibit a
          stage-specific binding to epithelial cells. Similar
          stage-specific binding to epidermis was also detected for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">natural IgM</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IgG</ENAMEX> autoantibodies in normal human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sera</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>].
        
        
          Dual color immunohistochemistry experiments
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Basal</ENAMEX> and parabasal layers of normal ectocervical
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epithelium</ENAMEX> show the presence of T cells and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MDC</ENAMEX>. A
          possibility exists that, beside interaction with
          epithelial cells, these mesenchymal cell types may

          field <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fluorescence</ENAMEX>). It is apparent that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MDC</ENAMEX> interact
          with epithelial cells adjacent to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">basement</ENAMEX> membrane
          (open white arrow) and migrate from lamina propria into
          the epithelium (white arrowhead). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Migration of T</ENAMEX> cells
          through the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">basement membrane</ENAMEX> is also evident (yellow
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arrowheads</ENAMEX>).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> cells invading <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">epithelium</ENAMEX> accumulate in the basal
          layer, and some of them enter parabasal layer with the
          assistance of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MDC</ENAMEX> (solid white arrows). Under the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pb</ENAMEX>/im
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interface</ENAMEX> (dashed line) T cells are associated with the
          differentiation of mature <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DC</ENAMEX> (solid yellow arrow). The T
          cells passing <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pb</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">im interface exhibit</ENAMEX> HLA-DR expression
          (open short yellow arrows). In the lower intermediate

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">yellow arrow</ENAMEX>). These data indicate that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MDC and T</ENAMEX> cells
          continuously migrate into the epithelium, interact among
          themselves in the parabasal layer, and show dramatic
          changes at the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">pb/im interface.</ENAMEX>

          (yellow arrowhead) accompany fragmentation of T cells
          (yellow arrows). These data indicate that transition of
          parabasal into intermediate epithelial cells at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pb</ENAMEX>/im
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interface</ENAMEX> is associated with transformation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DC</ENAMEX>
          precursors into mature <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DC</ENAMEX> with the assistance of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">activated</ENAMEX> (HLA-DR) T cells. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> entering

          In addition to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">CD8</TIMEX>, we also studied changes of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CD3 T</ENAMEX>

          cells at the epithelium surface. In contrast to T cells,
          fragmentation of mature <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DC</ENAMEX> occurred more distantly from
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pb</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">im interface</ENAMEX>, among mid intermediate layers (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.

          for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ras</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5J,<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K,L</ENAMEX>) showed similar features.
          Altogether, these observations indicate that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intraepithelial T</ENAMEX> cells and mature <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DC</ENAMEX> underwent apoptotic
          fragmentation among differentiating epithelial cells.
          Except epithelium surface, no <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p53</ENAMEX> and ras expression was
          detected in differentiating epithelial cells.
        
        
          Complete and restricted mesenchymal-epithelial
          network
          It is here shown that mesenchymal-epithelial
          interactions in stratified epithelium of ectocervix
          exhibit stage-specific interactions between mesenchymal
          and epithelial cells. They also include interactions of
          mesenchymal cells themselves either in lamina propria, in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> with microvasculature adjacent to the
          basement membrane, or in epithelium, in association with
          particular stage of differentiation of epithelial
          cells.
          The stratified epithelium of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ectocervix</ENAMEX> exhibits
          morphologically distinct stages of differentiation with
          well defined interfaces, and parabasal, intermediate and
          superficial layers can be subdivided further (lower, mid
          and upper layers of parabasal and intermediate cells, and
          lower and upper layers of surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX>). Hence, the
          mesenchymal-epithelial interactions should involve
          epithelial-epithelial interactions between and within
          epithelial layers. Some of these interactions, like
          diminution of contact inhibition, can be considered as
          downstream initiators of tissue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regeneration</ENAMEX>.
          We speculate that activation of basal (stem) cells
          toward proliferation is not a spontaneous process
          resulting from diminution of contact inhibition, but
          requires an involvement of so called basic "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Tissue</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Unit</ENAMEX>" 
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCU</ENAMEX>) of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tissue Control System</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX>]. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCU</ENAMEX> is associated with microvasculature and
          consists of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX>: perivascular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MDC</ENAMEX>, pericytes,
          and autonomic innervation. Extensions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MDC</ENAMEX> among basal
          epithelial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1B) indicate that they may be
          involved in the recognition of demands of epithelium for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">regeneration</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Perivascular MDC</ENAMEX> interact with pericytes [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>], which are accompanied by autonomic innervation [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX>]. The innervation is involved in the regulation of
          tissue quantity, possibly through the regulation of
          activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pericytes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>]. From this point of view, one
          should consider an involvement of epithelial-mesenchymal
          and mesenchymal-neural interactions as components of
          mesenchymal-epithelial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX>.
          In the ectocervix, epithelial cells differentiate from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immature</ENAMEX> toward aged cells, which undergo apoptosis with
          p53 and ras expression (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5Iand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">5L</ENAMEX>). This is
          accompanied by mesenchymal cells, which interact
          themselves and undergo differentiation and apoptotic
          fragmentation within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">epithelium</TIMEX>, and by binding of IgM
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IgG</ENAMEX>. Such situation can be viewed as a "complete
          mesenchymal-epithelial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX>" (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>).
          On the other hand, epithelial, parenchymal and muscle
          cells in many other tissues are somehow prevented from
          apoptosis, yet most of them do not exhibit infiltration
          by T cells and apoptosis of mesenchymal cells under
          physiological conditions. They do, however, contain basic
          TCUs associated with microvasculature. In addition to
          tissue regeneration, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCU</ENAMEX> is supposed to regulate
          differentiation of endothelial cells involved in homing
          of tissue committed T cells and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MDC</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>). The latter
          have been proposed to carry epigenetically encoded "stop
          effect" which stimulates differentiation of adult tissues
          to certain <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">stage</ENAMEX>, but prevents advanced differentiation
          and aging (see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ref.</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9, 10</ENAMEX>]). Such "restricted
          mesenchymal-epithelial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX>" still allows
          regeneration, but ensures preservation of tissue cells in
          the optimal stage of differentiation.
          Epigenetic programing of the "stop effect" appears to
          depend on the extent of differentiation of tissue cells
          during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">critical</TIMEX> period of development, such as
          termination of the immune adaptation. In simple terms, if
          the differentiation of tissue cells is suppressed,
          immature <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> will persist during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">adulthood</TIMEX> (muscular
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dystrophy</ENAMEX>), and if it is accelerated, premature aging
          will occur (degenerative <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>].
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        Our observations indicate that the phylogenetically and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ontogenetically</ENAMEX> developed hierarchy of mesenchymal cells
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MDC</ENAMEX>, pericytes, T cells) and immunoglobulins (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IgM, IgG</ENAMEX>)
        accompanies differentiation of epithelial cells from
        immature into the mature and aged <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">phenotype</TIMEX>. In agreement
        with views of others [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>], we propose that the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> of
        interactions involved (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>) is not uniquely concerned
        with immunity, but it includes basic interactions which
        stimulate differentiation of mesenchymal and epithelial
        cells. Involvement of immune system-related elements (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MDC</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T</ENAMEX> cells and B cells) in regulation of epithelium
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentiation</ENAMEX> represents a basic mechanism of immune
        physiology toward self, from which the immune surveillance
        toward nonself has evolved. Accordingly, when required, the
        intraepithelial mesenchymal cells regulating tissue
        differentiation may be converted into effectors of immunity
        against infected epithelial cells. Further studies of the
        mesenchymal-epithelial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX> may bring novel approaches
        to the prevention and therapy of tissue dysfunctions
        characterized by permanent tissue immaturity (muscular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dystrophy</ENAMEX>) or accelerated aging (degenerative
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX>).

          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">unlabeled antibody</ENAMEX> (HLA-DR) by the peroxidase-conjugated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> as above [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX>], without hematoxylin
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">counterstain</ENAMEX>. The slides were then incubated with the
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> unlabeled <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX>, washed, incubated with
          FITC-conjugated second <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX>, washed again and mounted
          in aqueous medium [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX>]. The antibody reagents in the
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> labeling sequence do not react with those in the
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> sequence because the latter are altered by the
          reaction product of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diaminobenzidine</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX>].
          Peroxidase-FITC technique allows separate visualization
          of peroxidase in visible light (either transmitted or
          dark-field illumination), visualization of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FITC</ENAMEX> alone in
          incident fluorescence, and combined visualization of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">peroxidase/FITC</ENAMEX> in dark-field transmitted fluorescence.
          Microphotography was performed using color negative
          films, and negatives scanned to obtain positive images
          ported into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Power</ENAMEX>-Point and processed <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">as</NUMEX> above.
