        Introduction
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Cardiovascular diseases</ENAMEX>, a major health <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> in
        industrialized <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3 4</NUMEX> ] , include
        vasculopathies such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">atherosclerosis</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] and autoimmune
        vascular <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lupus</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] , graft versus host
        disease [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] , and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">systemic sclerosis</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . Many factors
        are involved in the development and progression of these
        diseases including lifestyle (diet, smoking, and lack of
        physical exercise); <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, and environment [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3 4</NUMEX> ] .
        Also, infectious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX>, including both bacterial
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chlamydia</ENAMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 10</ENAMEX> ] , and viral (CMV) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12</NUMEX> ] , have
        been implicated. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV</ENAMEX>, a herpes virus, causes chronic
        asymptomatic infections in immunocompetent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>,
        termed latency [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . However, in situations of
        immunocompromise, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV</ENAMEX> is reactivated, which in many cases
        leads to organ failure and death [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . Epidemiological
        reports indicate that chronic CMV infections in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> may
        play an important role in pathogenesis of vascular diseases
        such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">atherosclerosis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">systemic sclerosis</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> ] . In addition, a recent report [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] revealed that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSc</ENAMEX> autoantibodies bind to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CMV late protein UL94</ENAMEX> and induce
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apoptosis</ENAMEX> in endothelial cells therefore implicating
        molecular mimicry as a potential mechanism accounting for
        the link between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSc</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV</ENAMEX>.
        Here we report that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCMV</ENAMEX> infections of gene-targeted
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice lacking</ENAMEX> IFN-γ<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> and subjected to whole body irradiation
        develop <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">vascular lesions</ENAMEX> that over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4 months</TIMEX> progress to
        severe <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vasculopathy</ENAMEX> characterized by significant neointima
        formation, a prominent feature of autoimmune vasculopathies
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>. Furthermore, imunohistochemical analyses
        indicate the presence of significant lymphohistiocytic
        infiltrate in the adventitia of affected arteries
        containing both T and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B-lymphocytes</ENAMEX>. Neointima stained
        positive for both -smooth muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">actin</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCNA</ENAMEX> indicating
        proliferation of smooth muscle cells possibly mediated by
        growth factors TGF-β 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PDGF</ENAMEX>-A and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PDGF-B</ENAMEX>, while TUNEL
        indicated apoptosis in the intimal layer in affected
        arteries.

          MCMV strain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smith</ENAMEX> stock was purchased from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Type Tissue Collection</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockville</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MD</ENAMEX>) This virus stock
          had been propagated in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SC-1 cells</ENAMEX> (mouse embryo
          fibroblast cell line). To enhance pathogenicity, the

          injection with <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5 x 10</ENAMEX> 5plaque forming <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> (pfu). Two
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX> after infection <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were sacrificed, salivary
          glands were collected, and virus stock was prepared as a
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> weight/volume homogenate. Concentration of virus in
          these homogenates was determined by a standard plaque
          assay on an infected <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3T-12</ENAMEX> fibroblast cell line. Final

          any of the control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 2A</ENAMEX>).
          Verhoeff-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">van Gieson</ENAMEX> staining of aortas collected from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFN</ENAMEX>-γ<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>-/- mice <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30 days</TIMEX> after irradiation (not shown) and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFN</ENAMEX>-γ<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>-/- mice <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60 days</TIMEX> after irradiation (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>)
          indicated that the intimal vascular lesion induced by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCMV</ENAMEX> infection was characterized by collagen deposition
          and smooth muscle proliferation. We utilized monoclonal
          antibody specific for α-SMA, a marker for myofibroblast
          cells, and found that neointima seen in the aortas of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCMV</ENAMEX> infected experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> contained
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">myofibroblasts</ENAMEX>. (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Immunohistochemical characterization of immune
          response to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">MCMV</ENAMEX> infection
          Immunohistochemical characterization of the
          inflammatory infiltrate seen in the adventitia and media
          of the affected aortas revealed both helper T-lymphocytes
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD4</NUMEX> +) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4B<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">) and cytotoxic T-lymphocytes</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD8</NUMEX> +)
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4C) throughout the lesion. Since one of the
          characteristics of autoimmune <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">vasculopathies</ENAMEX> is the
          appearance of high numbers of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">γ/δ</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCR</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] bearing
          cells, we studied this cell type in our model of vascular
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>. Results from these experiments revealed a large
          number of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">γ/δ</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCR</ENAMEX> bearing lymphocytes throughout the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lesion</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4D). We also investigated the presence of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B-lymphocytes</ENAMEX> in the vascular lesion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCMV</ENAMEX> infected
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T-lymphocytes</ENAMEX> were identified throughout the
          lesion these cells were mostly found in small follicles
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4A).
        
        
          Investigation of the role of cytokines and growth
          factors
          Growth factors possibly responsible for the neointimal
          proliferation were studied based on their putative
          importance in autoimmune <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">vasculopathies</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>.
          Immunohistochemical analysis indicated a significant
          overproduction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-β 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PDGF</ENAMEX>-A, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PDGF-B</ENAMEX> in the MCMV
          induced intimal lesion (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-β <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PDGF</ENAMEX>-A
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunoreactivity</ENAMEX> in affected <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">arteries</ENAMEX> is localized to all
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> layers (intima, media, adventitia) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5Band <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">5D</ENAMEX>),
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PDGF-B</ENAMEX> staining is localized to the media and neointima
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5F). <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MCP-1</ENAMEX>, a chemokine that has been implicated in
          pathogenesis of several autoimmune <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">vascular diseases</ENAMEX>
          including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSc</ENAMEX>, was noted in the adventitia and media of
          affected <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">arteries</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). We did not detect MCP-1
          positive staining in neointima (data not shown).
        
        
          Role of apoptosis and proliferation
          Further, we investigated the role of apoptosis and
          proliferation in vascular pathology triggered by MCMV
          infection of immunosuppressed <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. 
          In situ <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TUNEL</ENAMEX> revealed positive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">staining</ENAMEX> in the intimal layer of affected aortas (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fig</ENAMEX>
          7A). In addition, a small portion of infiltrating
          inflammatory cells stained positive by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TUNEL</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 7B).
          Smooth muscle/myofibroblast cells forming the neointima
          did not reveal any cells positive by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TUNEL</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 7A).
          Immunohistochemical staining for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCNA</ENAMEX> was used to
          identify cell proliferation. The majority of cells in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neointima</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 7Cand <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>), as well as infiltrating
          inflammatory cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 7Dand <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">FIG</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>), exhibit
          immunoreactivity for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCNA</ENAMEX>, indicating active
          proliferation.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        The major finding of this study is the formation of
        neointima associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">MCMV</ENAMEX> infection in
        immunocompromised <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. The disease described in our study
        resembles pathological processes seen in other autoimmune
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vasculopathies</ENAMEX>. However, it is important to note that while
        there are undoubtedly autoimmune aspects of
        atherosclerosis, this issue is still under debate [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] .
        The formation of neointima characteristic of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vasculopathy</ENAMEX> in autoimmune <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> by this approach has,
        to our knowledge, not been previously reported. While MCMV
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vasculitis</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFN</ENAMEX>-γ<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>-/- <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> has been previously reported [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> ] , that study does not focus on intimal proliferation.
        In our experimental conditions we were able to increase
        yield from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">62%</NUMEX> affected <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFN</ENAMEX>-γ<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>-/- <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> infected
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCMV</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> by including whole body irradiation of
        chronically infected <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IFN-γR-/-</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). In addition,
        a striking increase in the severity of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">intimal lesions</ENAMEX> was
        noted in irradiated <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). We propose that there
        are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> possible explanations for the increase in both the
        number of affected <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, as well as increase in the
        severity of vascular disease in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCMV</ENAMEX> infected <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IFN</ENAMEX>-γ<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>-/-
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> receiving whole body irradiation treatment. First,
        sublethal irradiation additionally immunosuppresses the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> allowing unlimited replication of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCMV</ENAMEX> which may
        lead to direct viral damage. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, the immune system
        after recovering from effects of radiation (reconstitution)
        contains large number of MCMV specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CTLs</ENAMEX> that may be
        capable of inducing intimal pathology while attempting to
        clear the infection.
        CMV infections have been implicated in a number of
        vascular <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV</ENAMEX> invades the vascular endothelium
        with the development of both latency and intermittent
        shedding of the virus to distal tissues, often by
        detachment of infected endothelial cells. In
        immunocompetent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> CMV infections are of chronic
        or latent type and are usually not associated with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">clinically detectable disease</ENAMEX>. In immunocompromised
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> such as neonates, transplant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV</ENAMEX> infections are a leading cause of
        organ failure and death. Nonetheless, the mechanisms of CMV
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reactivation</ENAMEX> and induction of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">vascular lesions</ENAMEX> are not well
        understood. Clinical and epidemiological studies strongly
        suggest the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">CMV</ENAMEX> infection in the progression
        of numerous vascular <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX>, including atherosclerosis [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 17 18 19 20</NUMEX> ] , rapidly progressive coronary artery
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, endothelialitis in heart transplant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 22 23 24</NUMEX> ] , coronary restenosis [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 26</NUMEX> ] , and
        inflammatory aortic disease [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27 28</NUMEX> ] as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSc</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> ] . We attempted to reproduce the endpoint of such
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> by using immunosupression and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">CMV</ENAMEX> infection,
        allowing us to investigate cellular and molecular events
        leading to this pathology. While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSc</ENAMEX> is an autoimmune
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> affecting microvasculature, some recent studies
        also described increased incidence of vascular pathology in
        the large arterial <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSc</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29 30 31</NUMEX> ] .
        However, it is still unclear if macro vascular pathology is
        a primary feature of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSc</ENAMEX> or an indirect effect of some of
        the downstream events related to this disease.
        Inoculation of immunocompetent <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCMV</ENAMEX> causes
        persistent productive infection in salivary glands followed
        by latency [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32 33</NUMEX> ] . This latency is characterized by the
        presence of the viral genome whereas infectious viral
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">particles</ENAMEX> could not be detected. In addition it was
        possible to reactivate virus either 
        in vivo or 
        in vitro from tissue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">explants</ENAMEX>. While
        there are several lines of evidence to suggest that the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immune</ENAMEX> system, or its absence, plays a role in MCMV
        reactivation from latency [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34 35</NUMEX> ] the mechanism is not
        known. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Latent CMV</ENAMEX> in many organs can be reactivated from
        its dormant <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> by several means of immunosuppression,
        including transmission from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX> to immunosuppressed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX> of transplants, and blood transfusion.
        Prior studies describe development of MCMV associated
        vascular <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> in large arterial <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.p.</ENAMEX> injection of suckling <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> induces vascular <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> in
        the aorta and pulmonary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">artery</ENAMEX>, which are characterized by
        cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">infiltrates</ENAMEX> containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">T-lymphocytes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] . A
        more recent study describes the development of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MCMV</ENAMEX> induced
        vascular <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> in the aorta of both <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">immunocompetent mice</ENAMEX>
        and those lacking IFN-γ responsiveness where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IFN</ENAMEX>-γ is
        determined to be a major antiviral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor</ENAMEX> preventing the
        long term persistence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">aortic vascular lesions</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] .
        The present study focused on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">neointima</ENAMEX> formation, which was
        seen only in immunocompromised <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. Our results indicated
        presence of both CD4 +helper, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CD8</NUMEX> +cytotoxic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T-lymphocytes</ENAMEX> in the adventitia of the affected <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">arteries</ENAMEX>.
        Significant portion of these <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">T-lymphocytes</ENAMEX> are <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">γ/δ-TCR</ENAMEX>
        +This subpopulation of lymphocytes has been identified as
        part of the pathogenesis of autoimmune <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX>. For
        example, it has been shown that γ/δ-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCR</ENAMEX> +lymphocytes from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSc</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> recognize and lyse endothelial cells at a
        significantly higher rate then γ/δ cells isolated from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . Also, a recent study indicates
        that γ/δ-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCR</ENAMEX> +bearing lymphocytes play an important role in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immune</ENAMEX> response of immunosuppressed transplant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX>
        to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">CMV</ENAMEX> infection [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] . NK cells, natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX>, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">complement</ENAMEX>, potentially important in controlling CMV
        infection, await further study.
        Growth factors TGF-β, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PDGF</ENAMEX> are contributing factors
        in vascular <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-β upregulates α-smooth muscle
        actin <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene transcription</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] . Since we identified
        significant α-smooth muscle actin expression in our model
        and this coincided with the expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-β, it is
        possible that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-β mediates α-smooth muscle actin
        expression in our <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>. The elevated expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PDGF</ENAMEX> in
        our <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> is also significant since the expression of these
        growth factors by endothelial cells can be induced by
        direct immune cell - endothelial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell interaction</ENAMEX>,
        promoting smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">atherosclerosis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV</ENAMEX>, as well as other viruses,
        induces expression of a number of cytokines and growth
        factors in cells 
        in vitro, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-β, a
        profibrogenic cytokine [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40 41</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MCP-1</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the
        β-chemokine (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C-C</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ] and this chemokine has been
        implicated in pathogenesis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSc</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX> ] . Our results
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>) indicate that this chemokine may play a role in
        recruitment of inflammatory cells to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV</ENAMEX> infected
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vasculature</ENAMEX>.
        We investigated the role of apoptosis in pathogenesis of
        MCMV induced intimal lesion since apoptosis of virally
        infected cells is one of the mechanisms by which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> may
        limit the virus spread. The presence of apoptotic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T-lymphocytes</ENAMEX> has been reported to be a feature of MCMV
        infection [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> ] . Apoptosis of vascular endothelium
        induced by <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">immune effectors</ENAMEX> has been described in both SSc
        patient <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX> as well as those of UCD <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">chickens</ENAMEX> (one of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> models for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSc</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX> ] . Recently, it has been
        reported that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IgG</ENAMEX> autoantibodies from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">SSc</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> bind CMV
        late <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein UL94</ENAMEX> and this induces apoptosis in human
        endothelial cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . We detected the presence of
        apoptotic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> in the intimal layer as well as in
        inflammatory infiltrate of the affected aortas (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
        7A& <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">7B</ENAMEX>). In the future we will ask if apoptosis in our
        model is induced by <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-endothelial</ENAMEX> autoantibodies, MCMV
        infection of endothelium, or is induced and/or perpetuated
        by inflammatory cells. Apoptosis of vascular endothelium
        may be the trigger that initiates the uncontrolled repair
        mechanism characterized by the proliferation of smooth
        muscle cells/myofibroblasts, leading to the development of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neointima</ENAMEX> in MCMV induced <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">vascular disease</ENAMEX>.
        The development of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV</ENAMEX> induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vasculopathies</ENAMEX> is a major
        cause of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">morbidity</ENAMEX> and mortality in immunosuppressed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. CMV infections have been identified as important
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediator</ENAMEX> of organ failure and death in transplant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">AIDS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. Although the role of CMV
        infection in pathogenesis of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">vascular diseases</ENAMEX> in
        immunocompetent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> is less clear, epidemiological
        studies strongly suggest that chronic or latent infections
        may accelerate the development of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> such as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">atherosclerosis</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSc</ENAMEX>. In fact, it is fair to hypothesize
        that several diseases thought to be of "idiopathic" origin
        may be triggered by chronic infections with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CMV</ENAMEX> and other
        infectious <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> in the genetically susceptible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX>.
        Animal models, such as those described in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>, will
        allow us to better understand the role that viral
        infections play in the pathogenesis of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">vascular diseases</ENAMEX>.
        It is crucial to identify factors responsible for
        contributing to the development of vascular pathology in
        order to develop better preventive as well as treatment
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">modalities</ENAMEX>.
