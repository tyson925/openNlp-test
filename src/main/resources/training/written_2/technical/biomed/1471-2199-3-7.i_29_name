        The human 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FHIT</ENAMEX> gene, located at the chromosome
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> fragile site <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">FRA3B</TIMEX>, is inactivated early in the
        development of many tumors [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . Murine 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fhit</ENAMEX> is also located at a fragile
        site [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3</NUMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> heterozygous for disruption of 
        Fhit , given low intragastric doses
        of the mutagen <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-nitrosomethylbenzylamine, develop stomach
        and sebaceous tumors [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] that can be prevented by viral
        Fhit expression [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . Fhit, a dimer of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">147</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>
        subunits, is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of the histidine triad (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIT</ENAMEX>)
        superfamily of nucleotide hydrolases and transferases [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7</NUMEX>
        ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hint</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> of the HIT superfamily are
        found in all forms of life [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . The 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. cerevisiae Hint</ENAMEX> homolog, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Hnt1</TIMEX>, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rabbit Hint</ENAMEX> possess adenosine monophosphoramidase activity
        that functions in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> to positively regulate function of
        Kin28, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ccl1 and Tfb3</TIMEX>, which constitute the kinase component
        of general transcription <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor TFIIH</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . A new Hint
        related <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Aprataxin</ENAMEX>, is mutated in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> with
        ataxia with oculomotor apraxia [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11</NUMEX> ] and has a yeast
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homolog</ENAMEX> termed Hnt3 [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fhit</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> of
        the HIT superfamily have been found in fungi [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13</NUMEX> ] ,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2 14 15</ENAMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] and hydrolyze
        diadenosine tetraphosphate, diadenosine triphosphate and
        other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>'-5"'-dinucleoside polyphosphates. The middle
        histidine of the histidine triad (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">His96</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human Fhit</ENAMEX>),
        which is critical for hydrolysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ApppA by Fhit</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 16</NUMEX> ]
        , is not necessary for tumor suppression [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18</NUMEX> ] .
        Nonetheless, wild-type and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">His96Asn</NUMEX> forms of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fhit</ENAMEX> are
        saturated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ApppA</ENAMEX> in the low micromolar range and form
        stable <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> with non-hydrolyzable <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ApppA</ENAMEX> in which two
        ApppA analogs are bound per <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fhit</ENAMEX> dimer and all phosphates
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cluster</ENAMEX> on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> surface of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . These
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">observations</ENAMEX> suggested that Fhit-substrate <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> may be
        the active, signaling form of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fhit</ENAMEX> and that the function of
        the catalytically essential histidine may be to terminate
        the lifetime of signaling complexes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] .
        Given that neither transcriptional nor
        post-transcriptional regulation has been reported for Fhit
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, the level of biological activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fhit</ENAMEX> may be
        controlled by levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fhit</ENAMEX> substrates, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX>, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that interact with Fhit-nucleotide <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX>. Fhit
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worms</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] bind <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ApppA</ENAMEX> and
        AppppA with 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> values of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 to 3 μM</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Human Fhit</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ]
        and the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. cerevisiae Fhit</ENAMEX> homolog [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] ,
        which was called Aph1 but is here termed Hnt2 under
        nomenclature aproved by the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saccharomyces Genome Database</ENAMEX>, cleave
        ApppA more readily while <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Aph1</TIMEX>, the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> pombe homolog, cleaves <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AppppA</ENAMEX> more
        readily [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . Consistent with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ApppA</ENAMEX> hydrolase
        activity of purified <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Fhit protein</ENAMEX>, most cancer cell lines
        that are Fhit negative at the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> level have higher
        levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ApppA</ENAMEX> than cell lines that are Fhit positive [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX>
        ] . Nonetheless, the actual concentrations of dinucleoside
        polyphosphates were submicromolar in every <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> culture
        sample [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] and thus, under the reported culture
        conditions, the measured dinucleoside polyphosphates would
        not be expected to occupy the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fhit</ENAMEX> active site
        substantially [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . Dinucleoside polyphosphate levels
        were measured in adenine-requiring 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> cerevisiae strains before or after
        disruption of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fhit</ENAMEX>-homologous 
        HNT2 gene [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] and in
        adenine-requiring 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> pombe strains as a function of
        disruption and overexpression of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fhit</ENAMEX>-homologous 
        aph1 gene [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . Recently, it was
        observed that diadenosine polyphosphates undergo a divalent
        cation-dependent conformational change that might mediate
        their biosynthesis, catabolism or signaling properties [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX>
        ] .
        Here we discover a requirement of adenine biosynthesis
        for high-level dinucleoside polyphosphate accumulation in
        the absence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fhit</ENAMEX> homolog in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> cerevisiae . By constructing
        active site mutants of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Hnt2</TIMEX> that were expressed in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX>,
        we demonstrate that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ApppN</ENAMEX> and, to a lesser degree, AppppN
        levels are controlled by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Hnt2</TIMEX> active site. An added
        benefit of these constructions is the availability of yeast
        strains that possess high levels of dinucleoside
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polyphosphates</ENAMEX> and at the same time express a mutant
        Fhit-homologous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, because these are conditions which
        have been postulated to constitute the signaling form of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fhit</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . Finally, using controlled genotypes we
        revisited conditions that lead to increased accumulation of
        dinucleoside polyphosphates [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33</NUMEX>
        ] . Recognizing that 
        hnt2 deletion is a pathological
        condition, we were particular interested in identifying
        conditions that lead to accumulation of such compounds in
        cells that contain a functional 
        HNT2 gene, rather than simply
        identifying conditions that produce diadenosine
        polyphosphate accumulation in the absence of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Hnt2</TIMEX>. While
        cells without a functional 
        HNT2 gene accumulate dinucleoside
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polyphosphates</ENAMEX> in excess of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 μM</NUMEX> in a variety of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nonstressed</ENAMEX> and stressed conditions, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">46°C</TIMEX> heat shock was
        the only condition that produced dinucleoside polyphosphate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accumulation</ENAMEX> in excess of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 μM</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> containing a
        functional 
        HNT2 gene. These conditions did not
        render the cells conditionally null for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Hnt2</TIMEX> because cells
        expressing 
        HNT2 continued to limit dinucleoside
        polyphosphate accumulation during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> of heat shock,
        though at levels of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~0.1</NUMEX> mM.
        Recently, discovery that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hint</ENAMEX>-homologous 
        HNT1 gene is required for high
        temperature growth on galactose and observations that
        alleles of 
        cak1 , 
        kin28 , 
        ccl1 and 
        tfb3 are hypersensitive to loss of
        Hnt1 enzyme activity provided evidence that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hnt1</ENAMEX> enzyme
        activity positively regulates Kin28 function, particularly
        on galactose media [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . Though phenotypic consequences
        of 
        hnt2 mutations have yet to be
        discovered, our observations suggest that synthetic lethal
        interactions with 
        hnt2 mutations are likely to be found
        in adenine prototrophic strains undergoing heat shock.
      
      
        Results and discussion
        
          Disruption of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HNT2and</ENAMEX> tetrad analysis of
          dinucleoside polyphosphate levels
          An earlier report demonstrated that disruption of 
          HNT2 was tolerated by haploid yeast
          strains without an effect on growth and that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ApppN</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">AppppN</ENAMEX> accumulate <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30 and 3</NUMEX>-fold, respectively on account
          of the 
          hnt2 deletion [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . Because
          those data were obtained by random spore analysis, we
          considered it important to test whether elevated
          dinucleoside polyphosphate levels co-segregate with 
          hnt2 disruption in all tetrads
          examined and whether any other commonly used genetic
          markers affect dinucleoside polyphosphate levels. Diploid
          strain BY71 (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>), created to be heterozygous for 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAT</ENAMEX> , 
          ADE2 , 
          HIS3 , 
          LEU2 , 
          LYS2 , 
          MET15 , 
          TRP1 , 
          URA3 and 
          HNT2 , was allowed to sporulate and
          was then dissected. As shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, tetrads
          produced <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> viable <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of which were large
          and white, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of which were smaller and pink on YPD
          medium, which scored as ade- on SDC -<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ade</NUMEX> medium. Markers
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">segregated 2:2</ENAMEX> in nearly all cases and possession of a
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1976</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">bp PCR fragment</ENAMEX> using primers <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4726 and 4722</TIMEX> always
          correlated with geneticin-resistance while possession of
          a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1200</TIMEX> bp product correlated with geneticin-sensitivity,
          as expected for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">segregants</ENAMEX> containing a nondisrupted 
          HNT2 gene.
          Haploid segregants from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> complete tetrads were
          cultured for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24, 48 and 72 hours</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">medium</ENAMEX>, lysed,
          and levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ApppN</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AppppN</ENAMEX> were determined. As shown
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>, strains containing an intact 
          HNT2 gene were never observed to
          have calculated intracellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ApppN</ENAMEX> levels above <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 μM</NUMEX> and
          typically were found to have <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ApppN</ENAMEX> levels below <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> μM.
          Strains disrupted for 
          hnt2 had <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ApppN</ENAMEX> levels of
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6 to 43 μM</TIMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX> of culture, rising
          to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 30 to 300</NUMEX> μM and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">350 μM</NUMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two</TIMEX>
          and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three days</TIMEX> of culture, respectively. The 
          ade2 mutation was partially
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epistatic</ENAMEX> to the effect of 
          hnt2 disruption on ApppN
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accumulation</ENAMEX>. 
          hnt2Δ strains containing 
          ade2 mutations were several fold
          lower in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">ApppN</ENAMEX> accumulation than 
          hnt2ΔADE2 isolates. Thus, deletion
          of 
          hnt2 afforded a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</NUMEX>-fold increase in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ApppN</ENAMEX> in 
          ade2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX>, consistent with an
          earlier report of a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31-fold</NUMEX> effect [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] , but a
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">211</NUMEX>-fold increase in 
          ADE2 strains.
          Earlier, 
          hnt2 deletion was reported to
          increase <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AppppN</ENAMEX> levels <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 2.5</NUMEX>-fold but the study was
          performed in 
          ade2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . Consistent
          with that report, the three 
          hnt2 <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ade2</NUMEX> strains showed only a
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-fold higher <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">AppppN</ENAMEX> level than the three 
          HNT2 <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ade2</NUMEX> strains, when nucleotide
          levels were averaged across the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> time points. In
          contrast, 
          hnt2ΔADE2 strains achieved a
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.7</NUMEX>-fold higher level of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AppppN</ENAMEX> than 
          HNT2 <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ADE2</NUMEX> strains. Larger increases
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">AppppN</ENAMEX> concentrations have been seen with disruption
          of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Apa1 and Apa2</TIMEX>, the diadenosine tetraphosphate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylases</ENAMEX> in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> cerevisiae [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34 35</NUMEX> ] ,
          indicating that they have a more significant role in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">controlling AppppN</ENAMEX> levels than does Hnt2. In the case of
          disruption of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fhit</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Hnt2</NUMEX>-homologous 
          aph1 gene in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. pombe</ENAMEX> , which encodes an enzyme
          relatively specific for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AppppA</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] , a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">290</NUMEX>-fold
          increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">AppppA</ENAMEX> concentration was observed [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] .
          Our data indicate that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hnt2</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">hydrolyzes</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ApppN</ENAMEX> and AppppN 
          in vivo in budding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> and that
          an intact adenine biosynthetic pathway is required for
          high-level synthesis and accumulation of adenylylated
          dinucleoside polyphosphates.
        
        
          Hnt2 active site-dependence of dinucleoside
          polyphosphate accumulation
          Catalytic activity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fhit ApppA</ENAMEX> hydrolase depends
          on <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">His96</NUMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 16</NUMEX> ] . To test whether the active site of
          Hnt2 is necessary to control dinucleoside polyphosphate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accumulation</ENAMEX> 
          in vivo , wild-type and mutant
          alleles of 
          HNT2 that differ at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">His109</TIMEX>,
          corresponding to human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Fhit His96</ENAMEX>, were expressed from
          the 
          HNT2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> on plasmids (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>)
          in 
          hnt2ΔADE2 strain <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BY71-6c</ENAMEX>. As shown
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>, reintroduction of wild-type 
          HNT2 produced a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40 to 125</NUMEX>-fold
          reduction in intracellular concentrations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ApppN</ENAMEX> and a
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX>-fold reduction in levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AppppN</ENAMEX>. This
          reduction was active-site dependent: adding back
          multicopy 
          HNT2 with the nucleophilic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">histidine</ENAMEX> replaced by alanine or aspartate reduced
          dinucleoside polyphosphate levels less than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-fold.
        
        
          Dinucleoside polyphosphate levels may not be
          limited by the levels of lysyl tRNA synthetase
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AppppA</ENAMEX> is induced by heat shock in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] and
          the induction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AppppA</ENAMEX> was thought to be a function of
          the heat-shock inducible <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LysU</ENAMEX> lysyl tRNA synthetase.
          However, deletion of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lysU</ENAMEX> had no effect on heat-shock
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inducible AppppA</ENAMEX> accumulation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] . The 
          KRS1 gene [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] encoding cytosolic
          lysyl tRNA synthetase was cloned into multicopy plasmid

          ADE2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HNT2</ENAMEX> ) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BY71-6c</ENAMEX> ( 
          ADE2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hnt2</ENAMEX> ) were transformed with
          pM1 and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the pRS423</TIMEX> control plasmid, and cultures were
          harvested at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24, 48 and 72 hours</TIMEX>. Determination of ApppN
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AppppN</ENAMEX> concentrations revealed that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ApppN</ENAMEX> levels are
          substantially higher in 
          hnt2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> than in isogenic
          wild-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">types</ENAMEX> at all time points and that plasmids
          conferring multiple copies of 
          KRS1 did not increase <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ApppN</ENAMEX> or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AppppN</ENAMEX> levels at any culture time point (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5</ENAMEX>). To
          address whether <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plasmid pM1</ENAMEX> indeed increased lysyl tRNA
          synthetase activity, lysates from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pRS423</TIMEX> and
          pM1-transformed <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BY71-6c</ENAMEX> were assayed for incorporation of
          3H <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">lysine</ENAMEX> into <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast tRNA</ENAMEX>. As shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>,
          tRNA-dependent lysine incorporation was increased
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.1</NUMEX>-fold by expression of 
          KRS1 from a multicopy plasmid.
        
        
          Heat shock is the most effective stress for
          elevation of dinucleoside polyphosphates
          In the wild and in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> are exposed
          to stresses such as hypo-osmotic or hyperosmotic
          conditions, toxic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cations</ENAMEX>, heat shock and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>-cycle
          disruptive reagents. To test whether such conditions
          induce dinucleoside polyphosphates in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hnt2</NUMEX>- or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Hnt2</NUMEX>+
          cells, we incubated 
          ADE2 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hnt2</ENAMEX> and 
          ADE2 <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">HNT2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX>
          sorbitol, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> mM CdCl 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">46 °C</TIMEX> heat shock, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> mM caffeine,
          or in rich <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">media</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two hours</TIMEX> and determined
          dinucleoside polyphosphate levels. Additionally, to test
          whether moderate overexpression of the lysyl tRNA
          synthetase gene affected accumulation, we compared
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> transformants to multicopy 
          KRS1 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">transformants</ENAMEX> of the two
          strains. As shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 6</ENAMEX>, the 
          hnt2 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> had substantially
          higher <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ApppN</ENAMEX> levels than 
          HNT2 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> under all conditions.
          Among the 
          hnt2 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX>, only heat shocked
          samples showed evidence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ApppN</ENAMEX> levels higher than the
          levels in nonstressed 
          hnt2 cells. Similarly, among the 
          HNT2 <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX>, the heat shocked
          samples showed increased <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ApppN</ENAMEX> levels compared with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX>-treated cells while CdCl 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> and other treated samples showed no
          significant changes. 
          KRS1 on a multicopy plasmid showed
          no significant alteration of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ApppN</ENAMEX> levels in any sample.
          As with other experiments, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AppppN</ENAMEX> levels were lower than
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ApppN</ENAMEX> levels in all cases. Heat shock was the best
          inducer of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AppppN</ENAMEX>. Hypotonic, hypertonic and caffeine
          treated media produced no increase in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">AppppN</ENAMEX> (not
          shown).
          To further investigate the kinetics of heat shock and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cadmium-induction of ApppN</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AppppN</ENAMEX> levels, we
          transformed 
          hnt2ΔADE2 strain <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BY71-6c</ENAMEX> with
          multicopy plasmids containing no 
          HNT2 gene, the wild-type 
          HNT2 gene, or the 
          HNT2-His109<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ala</ENAMEX> or 
          HNT2<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">-His109Asp</ENAMEX> alleles of 
          HNT2 . Cultures were exposed to
          either <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> mM CdCl 
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 or 46°C</TIMEX> heat shock and intracellular
          concentrations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ApppN</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AppppN</ENAMEX> were determined at
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30-minute</TIMEX> timepoints.
          As shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ApppN</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AppppN</ENAMEX> levels are
          higher in 
          hnt2 strains than in cells with a
          functional 
          HNT2 gene, and were not
          significantly elevated by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> mM CdCl 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> . However, when cells were heat
          shocked, as shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ApppN</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AppppN</ENAMEX> levels
          increased substantially in cultures with every 
          HNT2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genotype</ENAMEX> (absence, presence or
          active site mutation). Increases in dinucleoside
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polyphosphates</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Hnt2</NUMEX>+ cultures cannot be attributed to
          thermal inactivation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Hnt2</TIMEX> because the presence of 
          HNT2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">plasmids</ENAMEX> continues to reduce
          incremental increases in dinucleoside polyphosphates even
          in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the fourth hour</TIMEX> of the heat shock. Furthermore, the
          active-site mutant alleles of 
          HNT2 , 
          HNT2-His109<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ala</ENAMEX> and 
          HNT2<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">-His109Asp</ENAMEX> , provided on
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">plasmids</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pB32</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pB86</ENAMEX>, demonstrated intermediate
          abilities to control dinucleoside polyphosphate levels,
          suggesting that elevated temperature reduces the
          catalytic defects of these mutant enzymes. The high
          levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ApppN</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">~100 μM</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">AppppN</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~10</NUMEX> μM) and the
          fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Hnt2-containing samples</ENAMEX> continue to reduce the 
          rate of increase in dinucleoside
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polyphosphates</ENAMEX> without reducing their concentrations
          demonstrate that heat shock induces dinucleoside
          polyphosphate synthesis and that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hnt2</ENAMEX> is saturated under
          such conditions. In 
          Xenopus oocytes, however, some work
          has suggested that heat shock-dependent accumulation of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AppppN</ENAMEX> is largely due to inactivation of degradative
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enzymes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] .
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        It had been reported that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hnt2</ENAMEX> controls <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ApppN</ENAMEX> levels 
        in vivo , with a minor effect on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AppppN</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . Here we show that the 
        ade2 mutation present in earlier
        experiments prevents accumulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ApppN</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AppppN</ENAMEX> and
        reduced the magnitude of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Hnt2</TIMEX> effect. In 
        ADE2 strains examined herein,
        deletion of 
        HNT2 increased levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ApppN</ENAMEX> and
        AppppN by factors of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 200 and 4</NUMEX>, respectively.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mutagenesis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] , X-ray crystallography [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 40</NUMEX> ] , and
        stereochemical analysis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ] indicate that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">His96</ENAMEX> is the
        nucleophile that attacks the α-phosphate of Fhit
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">substrates</ENAMEX>. Our analysis shows that the corresponding
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">residue</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">His109</NUMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Hnt2</TIMEX>, is required for hydrolysis of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ApppN</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AppppN</ENAMEX> substrates 
        in vivo .
        Other than effects on the concentrations of
        intracellular nucleotides, neither deletion of 
        HNT2 nor mutation of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">His109</NUMEX> of 
        HNT2 had phenotypic consequences. In
        the case of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hint</ENAMEX>-homologous 
        HNT1 gene of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. cerevisiae</ENAMEX> , the phenotype of the
        single mutant was mild and the biological pathway, positive
        regulation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Kin28</TIMEX>, the yeast homolog of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cdk7</TIMEX>, was
        revealed by synthetic lethal interactions between 
        hnt1 and hypomorphic alleles of 
        cak1 , 
        kin28 , 
        ccl1 and 
        tfb3 [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . Because backup systems
        to limit problems with 
        hnt2 mutant cells apparently exist,
        synthetic lethal interactions may be critical to identify
        the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Hnt2</NUMEX> biological pathway. Thus, if the major function of
        
        HNT2 is simply control of
        dinucleoside polyphosphates lest their accumulation inhibit
        other enzymes (i.e., <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McLennan</ENAMEX>'s "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foe</ENAMEX>" hypothesis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ] ),
        then synthetic lethal phenotypes ought to be sought with 
        hnt2 mutant strains that are
        wild-type for the adenine biosynthetic pathway, potentially
        under heat shock conditions. On the other hand, if the
        major function of Hnt2 depends on formation of an
        enzyme-substrate complex [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] , then synthetic lethal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interactions</ENAMEX> ought to be sought in heat shocked 
        ADE2 <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">HNT2</NUMEX>-His109<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ala</ENAMEX> strains. In fact,
        because 
        ADE2 <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">HNT2</NUMEX>-His109<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ala</ENAMEX> strains have high
        levels of dinucleoside polyphosphates and an Hnt2
        polypeptide, such a strain may be sensitized to secondary
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutations</ENAMEX>, whether dinucleoside polyphosphates are friend
        or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">foe</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ] .

          pRS423, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pB05</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pB32 and pB86</TIMEX> and transformants were
          selected on SDC-his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX>. Intracellular concentrations
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ApppN</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AppppN</ENAMEX> were determined for transformants
          from cultures in SDC-his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> as above. To determine
          whether a multicopy lysyl tRNA synthetase plasmid
          affected accumulation of dinucleoside polyphosphates, we
          transformed 
          HNT2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ADE2 strain BY71-16d</ENAMEX> and 
          hnt2ΔADE2 strain <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BY71-6c</ENAMEX> with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control plasmid</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pRS423</ENAMEX> and with plasmid <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pM1</TIMEX>.
          Transformants were grown for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24, 48 and 72 hours</TIMEX> in
          SDC-his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX> and intracellular dinucleoside
          polyphosphate concentrations were determined as above. To
          survey dinucleoside polyphosphate induction as a function
          of potential stress conditions, strain <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BY71-6c</ENAMEX> was
          transformed with either <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pRS423</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">pM1</NUMEX> (effectively 
          hnt2Δ and 
          hnt2Δ YEp 
          KRS1 , respectively) and strain
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BY71-16d</ENAMEX> was transformed with the same plasmids
          (effectively 
          HNT2Δ and 
          HNT2Δ YEp 
          KRS1 , respectively). After <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">48</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> of culture, cells were pelleted and resuspended in
          either <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YPD</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, SDC-his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX>, or the same media
          supplemented with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> mM CdCl 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> mM caffeine or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1 M</ENAMEX> sorbitol.
          The SDC-his sample was incubated for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 hours</TIMEX> at 46°C
          while other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> were incubated for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 hours</TIMEX> at room
          temperature prior to extraction for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">determination</ENAMEX> of
          dinucleoside polyphosphate concentrations. To determine
          the time course of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ApppN</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AppppN</ENAMEX> levels as a function
          of stresses, we used strains <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BY71-16d</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">BY71</NUMEX>-6c
          transformed with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pRS423</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pB05</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pB32</TIMEX>, or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pB86</TIMEX>.
          Transformants were cultured for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">48 hours</TIMEX>, treated with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
          mM CdCl 
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 or 46°C</TIMEX> heat shock, and then
          harvested for nucleotide quantitation at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 minute</TIMEX>
          intervals. Experiments presented in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Tables 2, 4,</ENAMEX> 5and
          6were performed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> times,
          respectively. Experiments presented in Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3and</NUMEX> 4were
          performed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> times each. Because diadenosine
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polyphosphate</ENAMEX> levels vary with time in culture,
          generating a higher or lower range of values in
          independently conducted experiments, we did not average
          values obtained in separate experiments. For the data
          presented in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 6</ENAMEX>, triplicate cultures were prepared
          and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ApppN</ENAMEX> levels for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">identically</ENAMEX> treated samples are
          provided as averages ± standard deviations.
        
        
          Lysyl tRNA synthetase activity assay
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Strain BY71-6c</ENAMEX> was transformed with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">plasmids</ENAMEX> pRS423
          and pM1 (multicopy 
          KRS1 ) and cultures were grown as
          for measurement of dinucleoside polyphosphate levels.
          Lysates were prepared by glass bead disruption in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> mM
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tris Cl</ENAMEX> pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.5</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DTT</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40%</NUMEX> glycerol. Incorporation of
          tritiated lysine into tRNA was measured by modification
          of the protocol of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hou</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">51</TIMEX> ] . Reactions contained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          micrograms of total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20 mM KCl</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> mM MgCl 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> mM dithiothreitol, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>
