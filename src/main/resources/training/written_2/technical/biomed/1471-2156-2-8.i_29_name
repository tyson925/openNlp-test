        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dystrophin</ENAMEX> and its associated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are thought to be
        involved in the anchoring of the muscle cell membrane to
        the extracellular matrix [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>], and the absence of many of
        these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> can lead to the phenotype of muscular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dystrophy</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>]. The dystrophin-associated protein complex
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAPC</ENAMEX>) consists of several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subgroups</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX>,
        each associated either directly or indirectly with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dystrophin</ENAMEX>. The sarcoglycans are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> transmembrane
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>] that are organized by a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> called
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sarcospan</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>]. This <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> is thought to be involved in
        signalling at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> membrane [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>]. A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> subcomplex,
        known as the dystroglycan complex [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>], interacts directly
        with dystrophin in the cytoplasm and laminin in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">extracellular matrix</ENAMEX>, thus providing a structural link
        between the inside and the outside of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">A third</NUMEX>
        subcomplex involves the dystrobrevins [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7, 8</ENAMEX>] and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">syntrophins</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>] which form a complex at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal
        region of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dystrophin</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10, 11, 12</TIMEX>] and have an as yet
        unidentified function.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Desmuslin</ENAMEX> (DMN) was recently identified as an
        α-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">dystrobrevin</NUMEX>-interacting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> via the yeast <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-hybrid
        method [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>]. Both desmuslin mRNA and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> are expressed
        primarily in cardiac and skeletal muscle and the gene
        encodes a novel intermediate filament (IF) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1253</TIMEX>
        amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Electron</ENAMEX> microscopic analysis shows that
        desmuslin colocalizes with desmin, another muscle IF
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Co-immunopreciptation</ENAMEX> experiments revealed that
        the desmuslin and α-dystrobrevin interaction involves the
        region of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> encoded by exons <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8-16</NUMEX> of α-dystrobrevin
        and domains <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1A through 2A</TIMEX> of the desmuslin rod domain.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Desmuslin</ENAMEX> is hypothesized to function as a mechanical
        support to the muscle myofibers by making a previously
        unrecognized linkage between the extracellular matrix via
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAPC</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Z</ENAMEX>-discs through desmin and plectin [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>].
        As several IF <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, including desmin, have been
        implicated in human genetic disorders such as dominant and
        recessive congenital and adult onset myopathies [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15, 16</TIMEX>,
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17, 18</TIMEX>], desmuslin becomes a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> to be involved in
        myopathies as well. Supporting this is the exclusive
        expression of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMN</ENAMEX> in skeletal and cardiac muscle.
        The 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMN</ENAMEX> gene was analyzed for mutations
        in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">71</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with various forms of muscular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dystrophy</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">myopathy</ENAMEX>. In addition to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9 single</NUMEX>-nucleotide polymorphisms
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNPs</ENAMEX>) that do not change the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein sequence</ENAMEX>, we
        identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNPs</ENAMEX> that do alter the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> they encode.
        Although examination of controls has shown that none of
        them is likely to cause the phenotype, our results are
        useful for future disequilibrium studies of this region of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">chromosome 15q26.3</ENAMEX> and for mutation analysis and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> studies in other genetic disorders.
      
      
        Results and Discussion
        Using the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMN</ENAMEX> cDNA sequence (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">AF359284</NUMEX>) as a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">query</ENAMEX> to blast the public human genome database, we found a
        genomic clone (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">AC018999</NUMEX>) that included the entire desmuslin
        coding sequence. The alignment identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> exons which are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">schematically</ENAMEX> indicated in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Eleven</NUMEX> sets of primer
        pairs were developed to amplify the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> exons and the
        flanking intron sequences (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). The primers were
        designed to amplify overlapping segments of the desmuslin
        coding sequence as indicated in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>.
        Desmin, a desmuslin-interacting <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, has been
        implicated in hereditary distal myopathies implying that
        desmuslin itself may also be involved in myopathies of
        unknown etiology. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA samples</ENAMEX> isolated from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">71</NUMEX> dystrophic
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">myopathic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (as described in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>) were
        analyzed by direct sequencing to determine whether the
        phenotype was the result of a desmuslin mutation. All
        observed variants were subsequently tested in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">≤</ENAMEX> 156 control
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX>. These analyses revealed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> common and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> rare
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNPs</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19, 20</TIMEX>] that alter an amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid codon</ENAMEX>; 7 result in
        non-conservative amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> changes (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>).
        None of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNPs</ENAMEX> seem associated with the patient
        phenotypes as each was also found in the control
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Nine</NUMEX> silent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNPs</ENAMEX>, which did not alter an amino
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>, were also identified in the patient <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>;
        several of these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNPs</ENAMEX> showed a high degree of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">heterozygosity</ENAMEX>. Most were tested for and detected in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>, thus making desmuslin an unlikely
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> to be involved in these myopathies, but this
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> pass can be followed by others in a larger set of
        patient samples.
        Interestingly, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>, a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">C598T</NUMEX> substitution resulting in
        a premature stop codon in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">exon 1</TIMEX>, was detected in a single
        Nemaline myopathy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>. Neither the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">proband</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mother</ENAMEX> nor
        any of the other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> was found to carry this mutation
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2A</NUMEX>). The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">C598T</NUMEX> mutation removed a <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Pvu II</ENAMEX> site, thus
        permitting detection of the alteration by restriction
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">digest</ENAMEX> analysis of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> product generated from genomic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>. The assay is outlined schematically in Figure 2Band
        documented in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2C</TIMEX>. Using this <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Pvu II</ENAMEX> assay, the C598T
        change was detected in the unaffected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">father</ENAMEX> of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>, making it unlikely that heterozygosity for the
        C598T change is the causative mutation in the myopathic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proband</ENAMEX>.
        The removal of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Pvu II</ENAMEX> site allowed rapid screening
        of additional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and control <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> by DNA
        amplification of the region and subsequent digestion of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> product with <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Pvu</ENAMEX> II. One of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">312</NUMEX> control chromosomes was
        found to have lost the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Pvu II</ENAMEX> site, and the heterozygous
        presence of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">C598T</NUMEX> mutation was confirmed by DNA
        sequencing of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> product. Thus it is likely that the
        C598T mutation is not responsible for the myopathic
        phenotype of the proband. This is a surprising result
        considering that a single copy of this stop codon is
        present in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.44%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2/454</NUMEX>) of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.002%</NUMEX> of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> is predicted to carry this nonsense mutation
        in a homozygous <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>. The phenotype of the latter
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> is not known.
        There is the possibility that either the heterozygous
        C598T 
        DMN mutation combined with another
        mutation in a different gene or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the C598T</TIMEX> in a homozygous
        state causes muscular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dystrophy</ENAMEX> or myopathy of unknown
        genetic pathogenesis. The C598T 
        DMN mutation is a good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> to
        be a modifier for muscular and/or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cardiac phenotypes</ENAMEX>,
        considering: (i) the frequency of the mutation in the
        normal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> in the heterozygous as well as homozygous
        state; and (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ii</ENAMEX>) the key role of desmuslin in connecting the
        Z-discs to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">extracellular matrix</ENAMEX>. The desmuslin SNPs
        should be examined in a larger set of myopathy and muscular
        dystrophy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> to test this hypothesis. More
        specifically, it should be determined whether there is a
        statistically significant difference in the frequency of
        individual or clustered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNP</ENAMEX> haplotypes between the patient
        and the control <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX>.
        The desmuslin coding sequence is highly polymorphic with
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNPs</ENAMEX> that do not alter an amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> that do. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Ten</TIMEX>
        of these variations have minor allele frequencies that are
        represented in over <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> of the chromosomes sampled. These
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> are spaced within a genomic interval of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">≤ 28</ENAMEX> kilobases,
        or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 1</NUMEX> per <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2800</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX>. These highly informative
        markers are thus very useful for genetic analysis. The
        presence of so many SNPs within the coding sequence of a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> is somewhat unexpected and is much greater than
        that documented for other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. This degree of variability
        may reflect a redundancy of desmuslin at the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Z</ENAMEX>-line where
        other IF <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with potentially overlapping functions
        are located [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>].
      
      
        Conclusions
        The characterization of the individual components that
        form <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complexes</ENAMEX> in skeletal muscle and heart,
        especially information concerning genotype-phenotype
        correlations, will increase our understanding of the
        pathophysiology of human muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX>. We encourage
        other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> to test for the presence of the C598T 
        DMN mutation in their human patient
        samples affected by muscular and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cardiac diseases</ENAMEX>. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> of desmuslin null <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> models will also
        contribute to the understanding of the role of this protein
        in muscle and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cardiac disease</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Materials and Methods
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Blood samples</ENAMEX> were obtained from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and control
        subjects under <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">IRB</ENAMEX>-approved informed consent. The genomic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> extracted from these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood samples</ENAMEX> was used as the
        template for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> assay. Using an Advantage-GC cDNA PCR
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">polymerase</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clontech</ENAMEX>) and 
        Pfu <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA polymerase</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stratagene</ENAMEX>), PCR
        was carried out with primers specific to the exon and/or
        intron of 
        DMN sequence (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>) under the
        following conditions: <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">94°C</NUMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> min followed by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> cycles
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">94°C</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 min</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">57-59</NUMEX> °C for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 min</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">72°C</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3 min and a</TIMEX>
        final extension time of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 min at 72°C</NUMEX>. The amplification
        products were purified using the QIAGEN PCR purification
        kit and analyzed on either an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABI</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">373</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">377</NUMEX> automated
        sequencer with fluorescent dye terminator chemistry
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Applied Biosystems</ENAMEX>).
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> products were also digested with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pvu</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> and Msp
        I in order to screen for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the C598T</TIMEX> and C2836T <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNPs</ENAMEX>,
        respectively.
