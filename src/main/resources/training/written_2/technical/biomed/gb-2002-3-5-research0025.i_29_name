        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Aerobic organisms</ENAMEX> produce intracellular thiols such as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">glutathione</ENAMEX> (GSH), homoglutathione [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>], γ-glutamylcysteine
        (γ-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Glu-Cys</ENAMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>], <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">γ-glutamylcysteinylserine</NUMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>] and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mycothiol</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>] for protection against reactive oxygen
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">species</ENAMEX> formed as by-products of aerobic metabolism. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GSH</ENAMEX> is
        the most common of these. In addition to buffering the
        redox status of the cytoplasm and protecting biomolecules
        against oxidative damage, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GSH</ENAMEX> provides reducing equivalents
        to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">several enzymes</NUMEX> (including ribonucleotide reductase [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>], <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>'-phosphoadenosine <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-phosphosulfate reductase [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>] and
        arsenate reductase [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>]), and serves as a substrate for
        glutathione- 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S -transferases</ENAMEX>, which detoxify
        potentially dangerous electrophiles.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GSH</ENAMEX> is found primarily in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gram</ENAMEX>-negative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> and
        eukaryotes, and only rarely in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gram</ENAMEX>-positive bacteria
        (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). It is not found in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Archaea</ENAMEX> or in
        amitochondrial eukaryotes such as 
        Entamoeba histolytica [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>], 
        Giardia duodenalis [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>], 
        Trichomonas vaginalis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>] and 
        Trichomonas foetus [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>]. This
        distinctive pattern led to the proposal that the genes for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GSH</ENAMEX> biosynthesis may have been transferred to eukaryotes
        from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> via the progenitor of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mitochondria</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8, 11</ENAMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>]. If this hypothesis is true, then the genes for GSH
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biosynthesis</ENAMEX> in eukaryotes should resemble those from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alpha-proteobacteria</ENAMEX>, the modern <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> of the
        mitochondrial progenitor [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13, 14</TIMEX>].
        The biosynthesis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GSH</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) requires <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enzymes</ENAMEX>. γ-Glu-Cys ligase (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GshA</ENAMEX>) catalyzes the formation of
        a peptide bond between the γ-carboxylate of glutamate and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cysteine</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GSH</ENAMEX> synthetase (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GshB</ENAMEX>) catalyzes the subsequent
        formation of a peptide bond between the cysteinyl
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">carboxylate of γ-Glu-Cys</ENAMEX> and the amino <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of glycine.
        Each of these reactions requires hydrolysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> to drive
        formation of the peptide bond.
        We have analyzed the sequences of genes encoding GshA
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GshB</ENAMEX> and have discovered that the evolutionary history
        of these genes is more complex than expected. Our results
        are consistent with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> possible explanations for the
        distribution of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GshA genes</ENAMEX>. The most likely possibility is
        that <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">GshA</ENAMEX> arose in the bacterial domain, and the gene was
        transferred to eukaryotes at an early stage in their
        evolution. A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>, less appealing, possibility is that a
        GshA gene was present in the last common ancestor and was
        subsequently lost from many <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>, primarily those that
        live under anaerobic conditions. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GshB</ENAMEX> appears to have
        arisen independently within <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> and eukaryotes
        subsequent to the acquisition of the GshA gene. Notably, in
        each domain, the scaffold typical of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>-grasp
        superfamily was utilized to provide <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">GshB</ENAMEX>. Multiple examples
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral</ENAMEX> transfer of the GshA gene are evident, the most
        dramatic being a trans-domain transfer from an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alpha</ENAMEX>-proteobacterium to a plant sometime before <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">million</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX>.
      
      
        Results and discussion
        
          GshA sequences fall into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> distinct
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">groups</ENAMEX>
          We assembled an initial set of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GshA</ENAMEX> sequences by
          searching the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">NCBI Protein database</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>] using either
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GshA</ENAMEX> or glutamate-cysteine ligase as query words. The set
          was expanded using the output of BLAST [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>] searches
          with the sequences from 
          Escherichia <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coli</ENAMEX>, Saccharomyces
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cerevisiae</ENAMEX> and 
          Arabidopsis thaliana. Some of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> found in the BLAST searches correspond to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hypothetical proteins</ENAMEX> whose functions have not been
          experimentally verified. For <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> that are known to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">synthesize GSH</ENAMEX>, these sequences are likely to encode
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GshA</ENAMEX>. However, the assignment of function is uncertain
          for the sequences from 
          Mycobacterium tuberculosis,
          Streptomyces coelicolor and 
          Clostridium acetobutylicum because
          these <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> are not known to synthesize <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GSH</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4,</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX>].
          The sequences in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GshA</ENAMEX> set fall into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> distinct
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">groups</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>) that have no significant relationship to
          each other on the basis of pairwise sequence identities.
          The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> consists primarily of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gamma-proteobacteria</ENAMEX>, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> of non-plant eukaryotes
          and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> primarily of flowering <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">alpha-proteobacteria.</ENAMEX> Pairwise sequence identities within
          each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> range from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">24 to 93%</NUMEX> for group <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX> to
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">98%</NUMEX> for group <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, and from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">45 to 93%</NUMEX> for group <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group</ENAMEX> 1
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">corresponds</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GCS</ENAMEX> entry in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pfam</ENAMEX> database [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>].)
          The clustering of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GshA</ENAMEX> sequences into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> was
          confirmed using PSI-BLAST [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>]. PSI-BLAST is an
          iterative form of BLAST in which sequence information
          from hits found with an initial query sequence is
          incorporated into a profile that is used in subsequent
          searches. We carried out PSI-BLAST searches using GshA
          sequences from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> (group <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1, gi12517129</ENAMEX>), 
          Drosophila melanogaster (group <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2,</ENAMEX>
          gi7290879), and 
          Mesorhizobium loti (group <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3,</ENAMEX>
          gi13475748). In each case, PSI-BLAST converged within a
          few iterations (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>, respectively), and
          no <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> were found, even with
          statistically insignificant scores (data not shown).
          Cyanobacterial sequences (not shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>) are found
          in the PSI-BLAST output for group <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, but are quite
          distantly related to the other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> 3 sequences
          (typically <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 20%</NUMEX> sequence identity).
          The lack of significant overall sequence identity
          between the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> could indicate that
          these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> arrived at a common function by convergent
          evolution from different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">progenitors</ENAMEX>, or that the
          sequences have diverged so far that evolutionary
          relationships are no longer readily apparent. For truly
          related but very divergent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, it is often possible
          to identify locally conserved regions that are important
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> and/or function. Therefore, our next
          approach was to search for such motifs using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Block Maker</ENAMEX>
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19, 20</TIMEX>]. (It would be ideal to search for motifs with a
          divergent set of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in which the pairwise
          identities are less than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 40%</NUMEX>, so that the motifs
          found are highly conserved because they are important for
          structure and/or function. However, the high pairwise
          identities between <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> and alpha-proteobacterial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> in group <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> made this impossible.) Using a query
          set containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> group <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> sequences, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> 2
          sequences, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> group <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> sequences, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
          cyanobacterial sequences, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Block Maker</ENAMEX> identified three
          blocks of conserved sequence (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). A search of the
          non-redundant database using a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSSM</ENAMEX> (position-specific
          <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">scoring matrix</ENAMEX>) generated from these blocks retrieved a
          total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">81</NUMEX> sequences with 
          E -values <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">less than 10</TIMEX>. No proteins
          with identified functions other than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GshA</ENAMEX> were found with
          
          E -values <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 7</NUMEX>. Thus, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSSM</ENAMEX> was very effective at discriminating between GshA
          and non-GshA sequences in the database. Many of the
          sequences were duplicate entries of a single sequence or
          sequences from multiple strains of the same <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX>.
          Taking this into account, the search retrieved <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44</NUMEX>
          sequences of known or putative <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GshAs with E-</ENAMEX>values less
          than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. A subset of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> representing all
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> and cyanobacteria is shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>. The 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -values for each occurrence of
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> motifs, as well as the 
          E -values for each sequence, are
          very low in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. These data provide support
          for a real but distant relationship between the three
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of sequences, as well as the cyanobacterial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX>.
          It is difficult to generate reliable phylogenetic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> in cases such as this in which only small blocks of
          conserved sequence can be identified. Figure 4shows a
          tree generated from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> conserved blocks using the
          parsimony method in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAUP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4.0b</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>]. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> topology
          supports the findings reported above in that the
          sequences cluster into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> distinct <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, with the
          cyanobacterial sequences being most closely associated
          with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> 3 (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> and alpha-proteobacteria)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX>. The available information does not provide
          reliable information about the order of branching within
          each of these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. Similar findings were obtained
          using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">neighbor</ENAMEX>-joining method in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PAUP</ENAMEX>. A general
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> of eukaryotic and alpha-proteobacterial
          sequences that would support the hypothesis that the
          eukaryotic gene arose by transfer from the mitochondrial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">progenitor</ENAMEX> is not seen. The striking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of plant
          sequences with alpha-proteobacterial sequences will be
          addressed below.
        
        
          Possible explanations for the distribution of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GshA</ENAMEX>:
          lateral transfer versus massive gene loss
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5shows</NUMEX> the distribution of known and putative
          GshA genes mapped onto a universal <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX> of life generated
          using rRNA sequences. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> possible scenarios could
          account for the observed pattern of distribution. First,
          a GshA gene might have arisen early in either the
          bacterial or eukaryotic lineage and undergone a lateral
          transfer to the other domain. Alternatively, a GshA gene
          could have been present in the last common ancestor, but
          have been lost in nearly all <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Archaea</ENAMEX>, the
          deepest-branching eukaryotes and many <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>. Although
          the possibility of massive loss of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GshA</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> glance
          seems unlikely, careful perusal of Figures <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1and</NUMEX> 5reveals
          that most of the genera that lack <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GSH</ENAMEX> and/or GshA lack
          aerobic metabolism and therefore do not need <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GSH</ENAMEX> for
          protection against <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">reactive oxygen</ENAMEX> species. Many Archaea
          (all of the methanogens, as well as 
          Archaeoglobus, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pyrodictium</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thermoproteus</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thermofilum</ENAMEX> ) are anaerobes. 
          Thermoplasma, although
          facultatively aerobic, respires <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sulfur</ENAMEX> rather than
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX>. The deepest-branching eukaryotes ( 
          Giardia, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Trichomonas</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vairimorpha</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Encephalitozoon</ENAMEX> ) lack
          mitochondria, and therefore aerobic metabolism. 
          Entamoeba histolytica has
          apparently lost its mitochondria and now lacks aerobic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">respiratory</ENAMEX> pathways. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bacteria</ENAMEX> such as 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aquifex</ENAMEX> and 
          Thermotoga are anaerobes. Thus, the
          possibility of massive gene loss in these lineages is
          quite plausible. However, a problem with this hypothesis
          is that it requires that the GshA gene, which appears to
          be important only to aerobes, must have originated in the
          last common ancestor before the emergence of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, which occurred only after the
          evolution of cyanobacteria <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">about 2.6 billion</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX>].
          The possibility that <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">GshA</ENAMEX> arose early in the bacterial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lineage</ENAMEX> and then was transferred to the eukaryotic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">lineage</ENAMEX> and into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> archaeon ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Halobacterium</ENAMEX> ) is perhaps more
          appealing. GshA may have arisen in cyanobacteria
          concomitant with the origin of oxygenic photosynthesis, a
          particularly attractive hypothesis because this would
          have been the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time protection against reactive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">oxygen species</ENAMEX> would have been important. Later, as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteobacteria</ENAMEX> developed aerobic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">metabolic</ENAMEX> processes that
          took advantage of the growing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> concentration in the atmosphere, the
          consequent production of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">reactive oxygen species</ENAMEX> would
          have given a selective advantage to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">microbes</ENAMEX> that
          acquired a GshA gene by <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral</ENAMEX> gene transfer from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cyanobacteria</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GshA</ENAMEX> would have been advantageous to
          aerobic eukaryotes as well, providing selective pressure
          for the acquisition and retention of a bacterial GshA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>. Transfer of a GshA gene from the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alpha</ENAMEX>-proteobacterial progenitor of mitochondria, as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">postulated</ENAMEX> previously [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8, 11, 12</ENAMEX>], is one possible
          mechanism for the spread of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GshA</ENAMEX> into eukaryotes. Our
          analysis does not show a significant association between
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eukaryotic</ENAMEX> and alpha-proteobacterial sequences that would
          support this mechanism (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). However, the extreme
          divergence of the sequences limits our ability to resolve
          phylogenetic relationships, so this mechanism remains a
          possibility. There are other possible mechanisms for an
          early trans-domain lateral gene transfer, as well. For
          example, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Doolittle</ENAMEX> has proposed that protists that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">consume bacteria</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> may incorporate bacterial genes
          into their genomes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>].
        
        
          Lateral transfer of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GshA</ENAMEX> genes
          Lateral transfer of genes between <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> is
          recognized to occur very frequently, especially for genes
          involved in metabolism [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24, 25, 26</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lateral</ENAMEX> transfers
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> into eukaryotic nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> from the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alpha</ENAMEX>-proteobacterial progenitor of mitochondria and into
          plant nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> from the cyanobacterial progenitor of
          chloroplasts are well documented. Only a few other cases
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral</ENAMEX> transfers between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">domains</ENAMEX> have been reported.
          Examples include transfer of the phosphoglucose isomerase
          gene from a eukaryote to a bacterium [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>] and
          displacement of several aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">parasitic</ENAMEX> and symbiotic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> by eukaryotic and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">archaeal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counterparts</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>]. Our results show clear
          evidence of a trans-domain transfer of a GshA gene from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alpha</ENAMEX>-proteobacteria to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>. Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4shows</TIMEX> that the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> provide <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> bootstrap support to the clustering of
          plant <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">sequences</ENAMEX> with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> 3 alpha-proteobacterial
          sequences, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3illustrates</ENAMEX> the strikingly high
          pairwise sequence identities between <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alpha</ENAMEX>-proteobacterial sequences. Many of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alpha</ENAMEX>-proteobacteria are either plant pathogens (for
          example, 
          Agrobacterium tumefaciens ) or
          plant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">commensals</ENAMEX> (for example, 
          Sinorhizobium meliloti and 
          Zymomonas mobilis ). The close
          physical association between these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> and plants
          apparently provided an opportunity for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral</ENAMEX> transfer
          of the GshA gene, perhaps <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than 300 million</NUMEX> years
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ago</TIMEX>. A partial sequence is available for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GshA</ENAMEX> from the
          conifer 
          Picea abies (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">gi12580873</NUMEX>). This
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">77%</NUMEX> identity to the 
          A. thaliana sequence and thus
          belongs to group <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. Conifers diverged from the lineage
          leading to flowering <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">300-350 million years ago</TIMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX>]. Thus, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral</ENAMEX> transfer of the alpha-proteobacterial
          GshA gene may have occurred before the divergence of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conifers</ENAMEX>. Additional sequences from other conifers and
          more primitive <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> are needed to pin down the timing
          of this transfer.
          Lateral gene transfer from alpha-proteobacteria to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> is particularly intriguing because transfer and
          retention of a foreign <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> in a sophisticated
          multicellular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> is more difficult than in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bacteria</ENAMEX> can acquire <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> from their environment
          in multiple ways (transformation, transduction and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conjugation</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>]. Furthermore, a transferred gene can
          be easily transmitted to progeny after recombination into
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genomic</ENAMEX> or plasmid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>. However, known mechanisms for
          transfer of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> into <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> are more limited. The best
          understood mechanism is the transfer of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T-strand</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> from
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ti-</ENAMEX>plasmid of 
          Agrobacterium tumefaciens into
          wounded plant tissues, a process resulting in the
          formation of tumors [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>]. It is not known whether
          foreign genes can be transferred into <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> by this
          mechanism in nature, but such a process is plausible.
          Perpetuation of a transferred gene is also not as easily
          achieved in seed <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> as it is in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>, because the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX> must be incorporated into <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genomic DNA</ENAMEX> in apical
          meristem cells, undifferentiated stem cells that produce
          new organs, including the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cones</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flowers</ENAMEX> that generate
          male and female <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">gametes</ENAMEX>. An interesting issue is whether
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> 3 alpha-proteobacterial gene displaced an
          ancestral group <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> eukaryotic gene, or whether the
          ancestral gene was first lost, allowing the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alpha</ENAMEX>-proteobacterial gene to fill the functional
          gap.
          Additional potential cases of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral</ENAMEX> gene transfer
          are also suggested by our data. GshA from 
          Xylella fastidiosa, a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gamma-proteobacterium</ENAMEX>, clusters with group <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, rather than
          with the other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX>-proteobacterial sequences in group
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. This <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> is a plant pathogen, and its physical
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> has apparently provided an
          opportunity for gene transfer, either from a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> or,
          more likely, from an associated alpha-proteobacterium.
          Sequences from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Halobacterium sp</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NRC</ENAMEX>-1 (archaeon),

          Streptococcus pneumoniae (low-GC

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alpha</ENAMEX>-proteobacterial sequences in group <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, and a
          sequence from 
          Clostridium acetobutylicum, a
          low-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GC Gram</ENAMEX>-positive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacterium</ENAMEX>, clusters with the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gamma</ENAMEX>-proteobacterial sequences in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Group</ENAMEX> 1. (Note that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">synthesis of γ-glutamyl</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cysteine</ENAMEX> has been demonstrated in

          not in 
          Mycobacterium tuberculosis,
          Streptomyces coelicolor or 
          Streptococcus pneumoniae .) The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">occurrence of GshA</ENAMEX> homologs in these <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> could
          reflect persistence of an ancestral <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GshA</ENAMEX> in only some
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genera</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Archaea</ENAMEX> and in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gram</ENAMEX>-positive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>,
          or could be the result of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral</ENAMEX> transfer into a limited
          number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>. As discussed above, it is difficult
          to distinguish between these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> explanations, although
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral</ENAMEX> gene transfer hypothesis is most
          appealing.
        
        
          Why are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GshA</ENAMEX> sequences so divergent?
          The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GshA</ENAMEX> sequences are so divergent
          that it was difficult to demonstrate an evolutionary
          relationship between them. This level of sequence
          divergence is unexpected, and warrants some thought.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> obvious factors contribute to divergence of
          sequence in orthologs. First, the organisms being
          compared may be very distant. This explanation is
          probably not sufficient to explain the sequence
          divergence in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GshAs</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX>-proteobacteria
          represented in group <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> are reasonably closely related to
          the alpha-proteobacteria in group <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, and the crown
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eukaryotes</ENAMEX> in group <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> are reasonably closely related to
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> in group <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. Orthologous relationships between
          these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> can often be identified. Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,923</NUMEX> COGs
          (clusters of orthologous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32, 33, 34</TIMEX>] identified
          in 
          P. aeruginosa (a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">gamma-proteobacterium</ENAMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX> are also found in the
          combined <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> containing 
          Mesorhizobium loti and 
          Caulobacter crescentus (both
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alpha-proteobacteria</ENAMEX>). As a specific example, the GshB
          sequences from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> (a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma-proteobacterium</ENAMEX>)
          and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">crescentus</ENAMEX> have <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">41%</NUMEX> identity,
          and those from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">human</ENAMEX> have <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">43%</NUMEX>
          identity. Detection of orthologs in even more distantly
          related organisms is also possible in many cases. We have
          used PSI-BLAST to find orthologs of enzymes that use
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">glutathione</ENAMEX> (including glutaredoxins, glutathione- 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S -transferases</ENAMEX>, glutathione
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reductases</ENAMEX> and glutathione peroxidases) in both bacteria
          and eukaryotes (data not shown).
          A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> reason that homologous sequences may be very
          divergent is that little selective pressure has been
          required to maintain function at the level required for
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> to succeed. This situation may occur if the
          reaction being catalyzed is not very demanding, or if the
          product of the reaction does not contribute to the
          fitness of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> in an important way. An example
          of the first scenario is 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">o</ENAMEX> -succinylbenzoate synthase, which
          catalyzes the dehydration of
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2-hydroxy-6-succinyl-2,4-cyclohexadiene</NUMEX> carboxylate to
          form 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">o</ENAMEX> -succinylbenzoate synthase in the
          biosynthetic pathway for menaquinone synthesis. 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">o -Succinylbenzoate</ENAMEX> synthases from
          various organisms have very low pairwise sequence
          identities compared to those seen for other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of
          the enolase superfamily. The low sequence identities in
          these enzymes have been interpreted as reflecting
          relatively low constraints upon the sequence because the
          reaction is quite facile even in the absence of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enzyme</ENAMEX> (because it forms an aromatic product), and thus
          the enzyme is not required to provide a great deal of
          assistance [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX>]. This scenario is unlikely to account
          for the divergence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GshA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, as formation of a
          peptide bond is a quite difficult reaction. In fact,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>-grasp superfamily that catalyze
          comparable reactions (that is, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">GshBs</ENAMEX> (see further below),
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal S6 modification enzymes</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ala-D</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ala</ENAMEX> ligases)
          are sufficiently well conserved to be easily detected by
          PSI-BLAST, even though they utilize different substrates
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX>]. With respect to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> scenario, it is clear
          that the ability to synthesize <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GSH</ENAMEX> provides a significant
          advantage. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bacteria</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> that lack functional GshA
          are viable, but are hypersensitive to oxidative damage [
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37, 38</TIMEX>]. GshA-deficient strains of 
          A. thaliana are viable, but are
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypersensitive</ENAMEX> to cadmium [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Mice</ENAMEX> in which γ-Glu-Cys
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ligase</ENAMEX> has been knocked out die before gestational day <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX>]. Thus, low selection pressure cannot account for
          the high levels of divergence among the GshA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX>.
          Finally, sequences of homologs may diverge if they are
          subject to different selective pressures in different
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lineages</ENAMEX>. This might occur if the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> has a second
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">function (a 'moonlighting</ENAMEX>' function) in some lineages and
          is subject to selective pressure that alters regions of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> involved in that function. Alternatively, if
          a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> interacts with other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, then differences
          in those partner <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> will drive changes in the
          regions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> involved in the interaction. The
          possibility that the high level of divergence in GshA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> is due to one of these factors is intriguing and
          worth experimental exploration.
        
        
          GshB: a different story
          A set of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GshBs</ENAMEX> was assembled by searching the NCBI
          protein database using either <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GshB</ENAMEX> or glutathione
          synthetase as query words, and from the outputs of BLAST
          searches with the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.</ENAMEX> cerevisiae <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> as query
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX>. The sequences in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GshB</ENAMEX> set fall into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          distinct <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, corresponding to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> and
          eukaryotes, that have no significant relationship to each
          other on the basis of pairwise sequence identities. As
          seen with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GshA</ENAMEX>, PSI-BLAST searches with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GshB</ENAMEX> sequences
          from either <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> did not find <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">GshB</ENAMEX> sequences from the
          other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. A PSI-BLAST search with the human GshB
          converged after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two iterations</TIMEX>. The output contained only
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">eukaryotic GshBs</ENAMEX>, a few putative homoglutathione
          synthestases, and a few eukaryotic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> of unknown
          function. No bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">GshBs</ENAMEX> were found in the output.
          After multiple iterations, a PSI-BLAST search using the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli GshB</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">gi121663</NUMEX>) as an
          initial query sequence found <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">509</NUMEX> sequences of enzymes in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>-grasp superfamily, to which the bacterial enzyme
          is known to belong, but no eukaryotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GshB</ENAMEX> sequences. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>-grasp superfamily [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX>] includes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 15</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>
          of enzymes that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">catalyze</ENAMEX> formation of a bond between a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">carboxylate</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> substrate and an amino, imino or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thiol</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> substrate. The bacterial GshBs
          are most closely related to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal S6</ENAMEX> modification
          enzymes, which catalyze the addition of glutamate to the
          carboxyl terminus of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal protein S6</ENAMEX>. Other members
          of the superfamily include <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">carbamoyl phosphate synthases</ENAMEX>,
          cyanophycin synthetases and <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ala-D</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ala</ENAMEX> ligases. Notably,
          many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>-grasp superfamily were found in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eukaryotes</ENAMEX>. For example, 
          A. thaliana has at least three
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">superfamily</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> in the PSI-BLAST output, including
          carbamoyl <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">phosphate synthetase</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">methylcrotonyl</NUMEX>-CoA
          carboxylase, and acetyl <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CoA</ENAMEX> carboxylase. However, the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arabidopsis GshB</ENAMEX> is not found in
          the output. Thus, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>-grasp superfamily <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> in
          eukaryotes are more closely related to bacterial GshBs
          than to eukaryotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GshBs</ENAMEX>.
          Crystal structures of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GshBs</ENAMEX> from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX>] and human [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX>] are
          available, so we are able to consider the evolutionary
          relationship between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of sequences in the
          context of the structural information (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). The 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> and human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">enzymes</ENAMEX> have the
          same overall structural fold, which is typical of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>-grasp superfamily [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX>]. The human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">enzyme</ENAMEX> has a
          number of insertions, and in addition, has a circular
          permutation of the sequence that results in the movement
          of part of the carboxy-terminal domain to the
          amino-terminal domain. The sequence identity between the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> and human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">enzymes</ENAMEX> is
          strikingly low. Even in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> that can be
          <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">structurally</ENAMEX> superimposed, it is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 10%</NUMEX>. Furthermore,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 2</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> involved in binding GSH are
          conserved between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">enzymes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX>].
          The structural similarity between the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human GshBs</ENAMEX> indicates
          that the bacterial and eukaryotic enzymes could be
          related to each other, but is not sufficient to prove
          that they are related to each other because the common
          structure might have arisen by convergent evolution from
          different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">progenitors</ENAMEX>. This consideration is especially
          worth noting in light of the very low conservation of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> in the active site. Consequently, we looked for
          evidence of an evolutionary relationship by attempting to
          find <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that might be distantly related to the
          bacterial and eukaryotic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GshB proteins</ENAMEX> and therefore
          might bridge the sequence gap between them using the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Shotgun algorithm</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX>], which was designed to facilitate
          searches for distant relations between <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">algorithm</ENAMEX> performs a BLAST search with each of a set of
          query sequences. It then sorts the hits found by all of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, and for each hit, identifies the query
          sequences that found that hit. A hit that is found by
          multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> distinct <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, even
          with low BLAST scores, can be examined closely to
          determine whether it provides a link between the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>.
          We ran <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shotgun</ENAMEX> with a query set containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">eukaryotic GshBs</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">GshBs</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> S6
          modification enzymes (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">archaea</ENAMEX>), and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> of unknown function (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>
          from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> from the archaeon 
          Methanococcus jannaschii ). Sample
          outputs are shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>. Generally, sequences were
          found by either bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">GshBs</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the S6</TIMEX> modification
          enzymes, or by eukaryotic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">GshB proteins</ENAMEX>, but not by both
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. There was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> exception, which was a protein
          (a putative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GshB</ENAMEX> from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Medicago truncatula, gi 4808539</ENAMEX>)
          found by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all six</NUMEX> of the eukaryotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GshBs</ENAMEX> with BLAST
          scores above <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">194</NUMEX> (BLAST probabilities less than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.2e</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX>),
          and one bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">GshB</ENAMEX>, with a BLAST score of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">63</NUMEX> (BLAST
          probability of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.0</NUMEX>). Given the number of bacterial GshB
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> in the query set, the finding of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> bacterial
          sequence with an insignificant 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> -value can be regarded as a
          chance occurrence. Thus, we were unable to establish any
          relationship between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GshB</ENAMEX> sequences
          using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shotgun</ENAMEX>.
          Demonstration of conserved sequence motifs would
          provide supporting evidence for an evolutionary
          relationship between eukaryotic and bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">GshBs</ENAMEX>. In
          this case, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Block Maker</ENAMEX> algorithm used to analyze the
          GshA <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> did not perform well. This algorithm begins
          by constructing a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ClustalW</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX>] multiple sequence
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alignment</ENAMEX>. The circular permutation of the eukaryotic
          sequences with respect to the bacterial sequences, as
          well as the extremely low sequence identities, make
          alignment difficult and preclude the identification of
          blocks in the permuted region. Therefore, a different
          motif-finding algorithm, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MEME</ENAMEX> 3.0 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46, 47</TIMEX>], was used to
          analyze a divergent set of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GshBs</ENAMEX>, along with several of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> related to the bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">GshBs</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Twelve</NUMEX>
          strongly conserved motifs were identified (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>). The
          pattern of distribution of these motifs in eukaryotic
          GshBs, bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">GshBs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">S6</ENAMEX> modification enzymes (the
          enzymes most closely related to the bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GshBs</ENAMEX>) is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">illustrated</ENAMEX> in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>. Motifs <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11 and 12</TIMEX> are peculiar to
          the bacterial GshB <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and map to the
          substrate-binding region of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. These motifs are
          replaced by others in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the S6</TIMEX> modification enzymes and in
          D-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ala-D</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ala</ENAMEX> ligases (data not shown), while the motifs
          involved in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>-binding site (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1, 4, 6</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>) are
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conserved</ENAMEX>. This <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> scaffold clearly provides a
          modular structure that is easily adapted to bind
          different substrates in proximity to bound <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>. Two
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">motifs</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 and 5</NUMEX>) that contribute to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>-binding
          pocket were found in both eukaryotic and bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">GshBs</ENAMEX>,
          as well as other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>-grasp <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">super-family</ENAMEX>.
          These motifs were present in different orders in the
          bacterial and eukaryotic <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">GshBs</ENAMEX> (see Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>) because
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">motif 5</ENAMEX> is involved in the circular permutation that
          moves part of the carboxy-terminal domain to the
          amino-terminal domain of the eukaryotic enzymes. The lack
          of conserved motifs in the substrate-binding region is
          consistent with the comparison of the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">human GshB</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX>,
          which shows remarkably little similarity in this region
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>.
          In a case such as this one, it can be difficult to
          determine whether common sequence motifs have arisen by
          divergence from a common progenitor, or by convergent
          evolution driven by a common function. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> common
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">motifs</ENAMEX> found in the bacterial and eukaryotic GshBs
          correspond to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>-binding pocket. Thus, we examined
          the possibility that motifs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 and 5</NUMEX> arose by convergent
          evolution driven by the need to bind <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> by looking for
          these motifs in other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that bind <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>. We searched
          the non-redundant database with motifs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 and 5</NUMEX> using the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAST</ENAMEX> algorithm. Searches with motif <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 and 5</NUMEX> retrieved 145
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> sequences with 
          E -values <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">less than 10</TIMEX>,
          respectively. Nearly all of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with known
          functions in the output were <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">GshBs</ENAMEX> or other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>-grasp superfamily. All of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">145</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> found
          by motif <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>-grasp superfamily
          except for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">transcriptional regulators</ENAMEX> with 
          E -values of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4.8</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">gi15613287</NUMEX>) and
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">7.8</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">gi15224768</NUMEX>), dihydroorotate dehydrogenases with 
          E -values greater than 7 from
          several <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>, and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">proline</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">betaine</ENAMEX> transporter
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">gi1589297</NUMEX>) with an 
          E -value of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9.9</NUMEX>. All of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with known functions found by motif <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>-grasp superfamily except the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">LIM-containing protein kinase 2t</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">gi3273207</NUMEX>), which had
          an 
          E -value of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.2</NUMEX>. Thus, motifs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> are characteristic of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>-binding region of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>-grasp superfamily enzymes.
          The question of whether <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">eukaryotic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">GshBs</ENAMEX> are members
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>-grasp superfamily is difficult to answer with
          certainty because the eukaryotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GshBs</ENAMEX> are so
          dramatically different from the other superfamily
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> conserved sequence motifs involved in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> binding do provide a link between eukaryotic GshBs
          and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>-grasp superfamily, but it is rather tenuous,
          as it is possible that these sequences provide the best
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> to bind <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> within the context of this structural
          fold and have evolved by convergent evolution in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">eukaryotic GshBs</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>-grasp superfamily <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>.
          The lack of conservation in the glutathione-binding
          region of bacterial and eukaryotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GshBs</ENAMEX> is also an
          important consideration. We feel that the evidence for a
          true evolutionary relationship between the eukaryotic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GshBs</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>-grasp superfamily is rather weak given
          the evidence available at this time. For our purposes
          here, it is sufficient to conclude, in agreement with
          Polekhina 
          et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX>], that eukaryotic GshBs
          did not evolve directly from bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">GshBs</ENAMEX>, but rather
          that both evolved from ancestors that had the
          characteristic fold of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>-grasp superfamily.
        
        
          A different twist? A fused GSHA-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>-grasp
          superfamily homolog in an odd collection of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">bacteria</ENAMEX>
          In most organisms, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GshA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GshB</ENAMEX> are encoded by
          separate genes that are not in close proximity. An
          interesting variation on this theme may occur in a small
          number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>. 
          Clostridium perfringens, Listeria
          monocytogenes, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Listeria</ENAMEX> innocuans and 
          Pasteurella multocidans have an
          open reading frame (ORF) that could encode a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GshA</ENAMEX> homolog
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fused</ENAMEX> to an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>-grasp superfamily <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX>, raising the
          possibility that this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> might combine the two
          activities required for synthesis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GSH</ENAMEX>. 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> perfringens and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L.</ENAMEX> monocytogenes contain low levels
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GSH</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.25</NUMEX> μmol/g residual dry weight) that are about
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20-fold</NUMEX> lower than those found in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX>, but it is not known
          whether they synthesize <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GSH</ENAMEX> or simply import it from the
          medium [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>]. Experimental determination of the function
          of these fused <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> is clearly needed.
          The amino-terminal part of the fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> is most
          closely related to group <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1 GshAs</ENAMEX>, although the sequence
          identities are not high (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5</ENAMEX>). The carboxy-terminal
          parts of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are most closely related to
          cyanophycin synthetase, which catalyzes the synthesis of
          a polypeptide storage <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">polymer</ENAMEX> in cyanobacteria, and more
          distantly related to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ala-D</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ala</ENAMEX> ligase, which is
          involved in peptidoglycan biosynthesis in many <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>.
          These enzymes are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>-grasp superfamily,
          to which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GshB</ENAMEX> also belongs. However, there is no
          significant relationship between the carboxy-terminal
          region of these putative fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and known GshBs
          (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5</ENAMEX>). If this part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> does indeed
          function as a glutathione synthetase, then this would be
          another example of independent recruitment of an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>-grasp superfamily <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> to provide this
          function.
          The occurrence of an ORF for the fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> in
          this cluster of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> is curious because 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> perfringens, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L.</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">monocytogenes</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L.</ENAMEX> innocuans are low-GC
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gram</ENAMEX>-positive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>, while 
          P. multocida is a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">gamma-proteobacterium.</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> perfringens is found in soil and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sewage</ENAMEX> and is often part of the normal intestinal <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">flora</ENAMEX>
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>. It causes <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">gangrene</ENAMEX> and food
          poisoning in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX>]. 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L.</ENAMEX> monocytogenes and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L.</ENAMEX> innocuans are ubiquitous
          contaminants of soil and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L.</ENAMEX> monocytogenes causes
          listeriosis, a serious food-borne illness [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX>]. 
          P. multocida colonizes the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nasopharynx</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">gastrointestinal</NUMEX> tract of many animals
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX>, and causes a wide range of illnesses [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">49</TIMEX>].
          Human infections are most often caused by <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dog</ENAMEX> or cat
          bites. Thus, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> as either commensal or pathogenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> has
          apparently provided an opportunity for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral</ENAMEX> transfer
          of the gene encoding the fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORF</ENAMEX> for the putative fusion <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> in 
          P. multocida is particularly
          intriguing because <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX>-proteobacteria typically have a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group 1 GshA</ENAMEX> and a typical bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">GshB</ENAMEX>. 
          P. multocida has neither of these,
          and neither does its close <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relative</ENAMEX>, 
          Haemophilus influenzae. The lineage
          leading to 
          P. multocida and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H.</ENAMEX> influenzae diverged from other
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gamma</ENAMEX>-proteobacteria <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 270 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX>
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX>]. 
          P. multocida and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H.</ENAMEX> influenzae have considerably
          smaller genomes (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,014 and 1,743</NUMEX> predicted coding
          regions, respectively [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50, 51</TIMEX>]) than 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4,288</NUMEX> predicted coding
          regions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">52</TIMEX>]), suggesting that this lineage has
          undergone substantial genome reduction. It is possible
          that the lineage leading to 
          P. multocida and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H.</ENAMEX> influenzae lost <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">GshA</ENAMEX>, and 
          P. multocida subsequently acquired
          the fused <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GshA-ATP</ENAMEX>-grasp superfamily homolog in its
          place.
        
        
          Putting together the pieces: thoughts on the
          evolution of the pathway
          The pathway for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GSH</ENAMEX> biosynthesis involves <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> enzymes,
          and it is of interest to consider which of these evolved
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Horowitz</ENAMEX> has postulated that biosynthetic pathways
          evolve in a retrograde fashion, beginning with the last
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enzyme</ENAMEX> in the pathway [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53</TIMEX>]. This hypothesis rests on the
          assumption that <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> had, at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time, access to a
          supply of precursors for biological <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">polymers</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and polysaccharides. As the supply of a
          given precursor dwindled, the most successful organisms
          would be those that 'invented' an enzyme with which to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">catalyze</ENAMEX> formation of that precursor from compounds
          present in the environment. Thus, there would be
          continuous selective pressure to add enzymes in the
          retrograde direction to catalyze synthesis of precursors
          from ever more simple <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">constituents</ENAMEX>. Evolution of a
          biosynthetic pathway in the forward direction was deemed
          unlikely, as there would be no selective pressure for
          evolution of enzymes to produce intermediates of no
          further use to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Horowitz</ENAMEX>'s proposal is
          logical and appealing. There are cases, however, in which
          forward evolution of a pathway seems more likely. For
          example, many organisms make complex natural products
          whose roles generally involve killing or manipulating
          other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>. The pathways for building these complex
          structures have probably evolved in a forward direction
          by addition of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">enzymes</ENAMEX> capable of adding to the
          complexity of a pre-existing molecule and thereby
          contributing to its biological potency.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GSH</ENAMEX> biosynthesis pathway is most likely to have
          evolved in a forward direction. If the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pathway</ENAMEX> had
          evolved in a retrograde direction, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Horowitz</ENAMEX> theory
          would postulate that <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">GshB</ENAMEX> arose to take advantage of
          γ-Glu-Cys present in the environment. It is unlikely that
          γ-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glu-Cys</ENAMEX> would have been available because formation of
          the high-energy amide bond would be unlikely to occur
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">abiotically</ENAMEX>. Furthermore, this molecule would be unstable
          to oxidation in aerobic environments. However, evolution
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GSH</ENAMEX> biosynthesis pathway in the forward direction
          makes considerable sense. γ-Glu-Cys can serve some of the
          functions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GSH</ENAMEX>, and therefore could be advantageous to
          an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX> even in the absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GshB</ENAMEX>. Indeed,
          halobacteria contain millimolar levels of γ-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Glu-Cys</ENAMEX>, but
          do not convert it further to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GSH</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>]. However, γ-Glu-Cys
          is not an ideal solution, as it is more easily oxidized
          than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GSH</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX>]. Furthermore, the reactivity of a thiol
          depends upon its pKa, as thiolates are orders of
          magnitude more nucleophilic than thiols [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">54</TIMEX>]. The
          nucleophilicity of the thiol in γ-Glu-Cys should be
          diminished by the proximity of the negatively charged
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">carboxylate</ENAMEX>. Further reaction of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">γ-Glu-Cys</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gly</ENAMEX> to
          form <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GSH</ENAMEX> would improve its properties with respect to
          both oxidation and nucleophilicity, thus, providing
          selective pressure for evolution of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GSH</ENAMEX> synthetase
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GshB</ENAMEX>).
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> possible source for an enzyme to catalyze the next
          step in a pathway evolving in the forward direction is
          the enzyme that catalyzed the last step, as this enzyme
          has a binding site that accommodates the product of the
          last reaction, and that product is the substrate for the
          next reaction. A similar situation occurs for pathways
          evolving in a retrograde direction. This type of enzyme
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">recruitment</ENAMEX>, which takes advantage of already existing
          substrate-specificity determinants, but requires changes
          in catalytic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, appears to occur rather infrequently
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">55</TIMEX>]. For example, among <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">510</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> involved in the
          small-molecule metabolic pathways in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX>, homology between
          consecutive enzymes in a pathway occurs <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only six</NUMEX> times [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">56</NUMEX>]. Most often, enzymes are recruited to catalyze new
          reactions by virtue of the catalytic abilities of their
          active sites, and interactions required for substrate
          binding are then optimized. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GSH</ENAMEX> biosynthesis <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>,
          however, appear to be an optimal case for recruitment of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> enzyme to catalyze a subsequent reaction. As <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GshA</ENAMEX> has
          a binding site that accommodates γ-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Glu-Cys</ENAMEX>, it would
          appear to be an ideal progenitor of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GshB</ENAMEX>, which uses
          γ-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glu-Cys</ENAMEX> as a substrate and also catalyzes the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>-dependent formation of an amide bond. However, GshA
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">GshB</ENAMEX> appear to be structurally distinct. There are no
          experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GshAs</ENAMEX>, but recent work
          suggests that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GshAs</ENAMEX> are homologs of glutamine synthetases
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">57</TIMEX>]. GshBs have a different structural fold,
          characteristic of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>-grasp superfamily. Thus, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> support a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">scenario</ENAMEX> in which emergence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GshA</ENAMEX> was
          followed, in most organisms, by the recruitment of a
          different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> to serve as the progenitor of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GshB</ENAMEX>. It
          is particularly interesting that, in both the bacterial
          and eukaryotic lineages, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX>-grasp structural fold
          provided the starting point for the evolution of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GshB</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        Our analysis of the sequences of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GshAs</ENAMEX> and GshBs
        suggests that the evolutionary history of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> is
        more complex than expected on the basis of the distribution
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GSH</ENAMEX> in extant <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>. Our results, as well as the
        observation that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GshA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GshB</ENAMEX> genes are generally not
        found in proximity in microbial genomes, suggest that these
        genes did not evolve together. Therefore, we must consider
        the evolutionary history of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> separately.
        Although the origin of the GshA gene cannot be
        unequivocally determined, it is most plausible to suppose
        that it arose in cyanobacteria, which would have been the
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> cells to require the protection conferred by
        γ-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Glu-Cys</ENAMEX> against <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">reactive oxygen</ENAMEX> species. If this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypothesis</ENAMEX> is correct, then subsequent lateral gene
        transfers must have occurred to spread the gene to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteobacteria</ENAMEX> and eukaryotes, as well as to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">archaeon</ENAMEX> and possibly to some <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Gram</ENAMEX>-positive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>.
        Because of the high level of sequence divergence, there is
        no clear indication in the sequence data as to whether
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eukaryotes</ENAMEX> acquired a GshA gene from a cyanobacterium or a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteobacterium</ENAMEX>. After the acquisition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GshA</ENAMEX>, a further
        improvement in protection against <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">reactive oxygen</ENAMEX> species
        was obtained in most organisms by recruitment of an enzyme
        to convert γ-Glu-Cys to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GSH</ENAMEX>. This recruitment apparently
        took place independently in the bacterial and eukaryotic
        lineages, since the sequence of the eukaryotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GshB</ENAMEX> is
        remarkably different from that of the bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">GshBs</ENAMEX>,
        despite the structural similarities between these two
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. At least for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GshB</ENAMEX>, therefore, we can eliminate
        the possibility of transfer from the mitochondrial
        progenitor into an early eukaryote. The emerging picture of
        the evolution of the glutathione biosynthesis pathway is
        significant because it suggests that the pathway evolved in
        a forward direction, in contradiction to the Horowitz
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypothesis</ENAMEX>.
