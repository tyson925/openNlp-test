        Today, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an estimated one-third</NUMEX> of the world's population
        is infected with 
        Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">causative</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tuberculosis</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] , and tuberculosis
        causes <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 2 million</NUMEX> deaths <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annually</TIMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] . Many
        aspects of the interactions between 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> tuberculosis and its human host
        remain unclear. Not only is this bacterium able to evade
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">defenses</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX>'s immune system, it is also able
        to persist in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> and may reactivate to
        cause disease <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">decades</TIMEX> after the initial infection. A better
        understanding of the interaction between 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> tuberculosis and its human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> is
        critical to developing new strategies to control the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tuberculosis</ENAMEX> epidemic.
        A key feature of the pathogenicity of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. tuberculosis</ENAMEX> is its ability to
        evade the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">antimicrobial</ENAMEX> processes of the macrophage and
        replicate intracellularly. Mycobacteria enter macrophages
        primarily by conventional <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>-mediated phagocytic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathways</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . Following phagocytosis, phagosomes
        containing viable tubercle <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bacilli</ENAMEX> fail to acidify,
        apparently because of failure to insert a proton-ATPase
        pump into the phagosomal membrane [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5 6</NUMEX> ] . This leads to
        altered vacuolar maturation such that phagosome-lysosome
        fusion is blocked and the mycobacteria-containing vacuoles
        end up with an internal pH of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 6</NUMEX> and markers of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phagosomes</ENAMEX> and early and late <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">endosomes</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8 9 10 11</NUMEX> ] .
        The mycobacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> responsible for these processes are
        largely unknown.
        One method for identifying bacterial genes involved in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathogenesis</ENAMEX> is to express these genes in a nonpathogenic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> and isolate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> with increased virulence. This
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">technique</ENAMEX> was first used to identify a gene that enables 
        Yersinia pseudotuberculosis to invade
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HEp-2 cells</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . In these studies, 
        Escherichia <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coli bacteria</ENAMEX> expressing 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Y.</ENAMEX> pseudotuberculosis <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> were used
        to infect HEp-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> cells. Only 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli bacteria</ENAMEX> expressing the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Y.</ENAMEX> pseudotuberculosis inv gene were
        able to invade the animal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . Using a similar
        approach, Arruda 
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] identified an 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> tuberculosis gene responsible for
        invasion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HeLa</ENAMEX> cells. We have previously used a similar
        technique to identify 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> leprae <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> involved in
        intracellular survival [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . That is, by expressing 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> leprae <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX>, we were able to isolate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">recombinant bacteria</ENAMEX> that exhibited increased resistance to
        killing by murine bone-marrow derived macrophages [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ]
        .
        A similar approach was used by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wei et al</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] to
        isolate <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> 
        Mycobacterium smegmatis recombinant
        clones that displayed a greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-fold enhancement in
        survival after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">48 hours</TIMEX>. 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. smegmatis</ENAMEX> is a fast-growing,
        nonpathogenic species of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mycobacterium</ENAMEX> in which 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> tuberculosis genes can be
        efficiently expressed [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 17 18</NUMEX> ] . An in depth analysis
        of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> recombinant clone revealed that 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> smegmatis <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX> carrying the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> tuberculosis eis gene on an
        extrachromosomal multicopy plasmid displayed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.4</NUMEX>- to
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.3</NUMEX>-fold greater survival in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">U937</TIMEX> macrophages than
        wild-type 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> smegmatis <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 to 48</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> post-infection [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42</NUMEX>-kDa 
        eis <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene product</ENAMEX> has been shown to be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with the mycobacterial cell surface and is
        released into extracellular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">medium</ENAMEX>, but its precise
        function is not yet known [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] .
        In the studies reported here, we used a similar
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">enrichment</ENAMEX> scheme to identify <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> additional recombinant 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. smegmatis</ENAMEX> clones, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sur2 and sur3</TIMEX>,
        that demonstrated enhanced survival during infections of
        THP-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">monocyte-</ENAMEX>derived macrophages. The 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. tuberculosis ORFs</ENAMEX> responsible for
        increased survival were shown to be 
        Rv0365c for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the sur2</TIMEX> clone and 
        Rv2235 for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the sur3</TIMEX> clone. These ORFs
        encode <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">as-</NUMEX>of-yet unknown functions.
      
      
        Results
        Cosmids carrying 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> tuberculosis <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] were
        electroporated into 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> smegmatis <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">LR222</TIMEX> to create a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">library of</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> smegmatis transformants, each of
        which carries a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">pYUB178::H37Rv</TIMEX> cosmid integrated into its
        chromosome. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> was generated from about 4000
        independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">transformants</ENAMEX>. This represents <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 20</NUMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> tuberculosis genome-equivalents
        given that ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">225</NUMEX> cosmids contain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> genome-equivalent of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> tuberculosis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] .
        To enrich for clones with increased survival in human
        macrophages, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> was passed through THP-1
        macrophages as shown schematically in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">THP-1</ENAMEX> is a
        human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">monocyte-</ENAMEX>derived macrophage cell line [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] and
        wild-type 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> smegmatis <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> are rapidly
        killed by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">THP-1 macrophages</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . After <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> rounds of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">enrichment</ENAMEX>, the resulting clones were analyzed individually
        by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern blot</ENAMEX> to evaluate the number of different clones
        present as previously described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . Out of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3000</TIMEX>
        colonies recovered, genomic DNAs from the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">90</NUMEX>
        randomly chosen <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> were digested with 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Pst I and</ENAMEX> hybridized with the pYUB178
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vector</ENAMEX>. Strains carrying different cosmids should exhibit a
        different pattern of hybridizing bands because of the
        presence of different 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> tuberculosis <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H37Rv</ENAMEX> inserts. Two
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clones</ENAMEX>, designated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">sur2 and sur3</TIMEX>, were <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">each present three</TIMEX>
        times and were chosen for further study. The remaining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">84</NUMEX>
        clones each displayed unique patterns.
        As a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step in the analysis of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">sur2</NUMEX> clone, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> course of its survival in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">THP-1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">macrophages</ENAMEX> was
        determined by infecting <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">THP-1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">macrophages</ENAMEX>, lysing the
        infected macrophages at various times after phagocytosis,
        and enumerating viable intracellular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> by plating on
        solid medium. Both parental and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sur2 bacteria</ENAMEX> were
        rapidly killed during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the first few hours</TIMEX> after
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phagocytosis</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sur2 bacteria</ENAMEX> appeared to
        survive slightly better at the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9 hour</TIMEX> time point, but the
        difference was not statistically significant.
        To compare directly the relative ability of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the sur2</TIMEX> and
        wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> to survive in macrophages, THP-1
        macrophages were infected with a mixture of a genetically
        marked control strain and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the sur2</TIMEX> strain and the survival
        of each strain was followed independently as previously
        described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . The wild-type strain expresses the 
        xylE <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene product</ENAMEX>, catechol
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,3</NUMEX>-dioxygenase, such that when its <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> are sprayed
        with catechol, they turn bright yellow, while wild-type
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> remain white. In essence, each well of the
        experiment contains an internal standard (the wild-type
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>) to which to compare the survival of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">recombinant bacteria</ENAMEX>. In experiments in which THP-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> cells
        were infected at a <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">MOI of 50</ENAMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX> (results in <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~1</NUMEX> phagocytosed 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> smegmatis <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacterium</ENAMEX> per
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">macrophage</ENAMEX>) with a mixture containing equal numbers of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> of the 
        xylE -expressing control strain and a
        strain carrying the cosmid vector <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">pYUB178</TIMEX>, the ratio of
        recovered white <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> to yellow <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>:<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> at all
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> points (data not shown). This indicates that the
        survival of the 
        xylE -expressing strain was the same
        as that of the wild-type and could be used an internal
        reference by which to measure the survival of other
        clones.
        In <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coinfection</ENAMEX> experiments with 
        xylE -expressing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>, both sur2
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sur3 bacteria</ENAMEX> exhibited increased survival (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>).
        Immediately after the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 hour</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">phagocytosis period</TIMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">0 hr time</TIMEX>
        point) the ratio of sur2 <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> to 
        xylE -expressing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> was <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1:1 and</TIMEX>
        by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12 hours</TIMEX> it was <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 7:1.</TIMEX> By <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX>, the ratio was
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>. The differences between the ratios at
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> time point and the subsequent time points were
        statistically significant (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.005</NUMEX>) for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 9, 12</TIMEX>, and
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hr time</TIMEX> points. The ratio of sur3 <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> to control
        colonies increased from <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1:1 at time 0 to 4:1 at 12 hours</TIMEX>
        and to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>:<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX> (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.005</NUMEX>).
        Because the recombinant clones contain integrated
        pYUB178::<NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">H37Rv</NUMEX> cosmids, the following strategy was used to
        isolate cosmids corresponding to those in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the sur2</TIMEX> and sur3
        clones. First, genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the sur2</TIMEX> clone was digested
        with 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Pst I, and</ENAMEX> genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> from the sur3
        clone was digested with 
        Bam <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HI</ENAMEX> to generate fragments of each
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">integrated</ENAMEX> cosmid carrying 
        oriE, aph, and a portion of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> tuberculosis genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> insert.
        The presence of 
        oriE allows the recombinant to
        replicate as a plasmid in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX>. The digestion products were
        treated with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">T4 DNA ligase</ENAMEX> and transformed into 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli XL 1</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blue</ENAMEX>. Plasmid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> from
        the resulting kanamycin-resistant <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> were analyzed by
        restriction site mapping and partial sequencing of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> tuberculosis genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> insert as
        described in <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Materials and Methods</ENAMEX>. For the sur2
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">recombinant</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> primers were designed to amplify a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.8</NUMEX> kb
        region of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> tuberculosis insert from 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> tuberculosis genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> for use
        as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX> blot experiments. Probing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX> blots
        of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">pYUB178::H37Rv</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> with
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.8</NUMEX> kb PCR fragment led to the isolation of a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> kb
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">plasmid</ENAMEX>. This plasmid contained an intact 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oriE</ENAMEX> and 
        aph gene, a portion of the integrase
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.1</NUMEX> kb of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> tuberculosis genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> (Figure
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA sequence</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Southern blot</ENAMEX> data indicated
        that the recovered plasmid was the same as the cosmid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">integrated</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the sur2</TIMEX> genome (data not shown). For
        example, sequencing of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> amplicons of the junctions
        between the mycobacterial sequences and vector sequences
        revealed that the junctions in the recovered plasmid were
        identical to those in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the sur2</TIMEX> genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>.
        Comparison of the sequence of the cloned <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.1</NUMEX> kb fragment
        with the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> tuberculosis <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">H37Rv</ENAMEX> genome sequence
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] revealed that it contains portions of the 
        Rv0366c and 
        Rv0365c genes (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). In the sur2
        clone, the amino-terminal <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">970 bp</NUMEX> of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1128</TIMEX> bp 
        Rv0365c <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORF</ENAMEX> is fused to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">14 bp</NUMEX> from
        the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">pYUB178</NUMEX> vector to generate an ORF encoding <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">328</NUMEX> amino
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">acids</ENAMEX> (aa), compared to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">376</NUMEX> aa encoded by the full-length 
        Rv0365c <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORF</ENAMEX>. The insert also contains
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">104 bp</TIMEX> of the 
        Rv0366c <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORF</ENAMEX> fused to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">220 bp</NUMEX> of the L5
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">integrase ORF</ENAMEX>. This ORF could encode a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">108</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aa protein</ENAMEX> which
        contains the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">73</NUMEX> amino-terminal amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">344</NUMEX> aa L5
        integrase <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> fused to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</NUMEX> carboxyl-terminal amino
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">acids</ENAMEX> of the 
        Rv0366c <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORF</ENAMEX>.
        To determine if the 
        Rv0365c gene was responsible for the
        increased survival of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sur2 bacteria</ENAMEX>, the full-length 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. tuberculosis</ENAMEX> Rv0365c <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORF</ENAMEX> as well
        as a truncated ORF similar to that present in the insert in
        the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">sur2</NUMEX> clone were subcloned into the pHIP vector
        downstream of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. tuberculosis</ENAMEX> hsp65 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX>. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">truncated ORF</ENAMEX> contained the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">969 bp</NUMEX> of 
        Rv0365c present in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the sur2</TIMEX> insert

        To investigate the difference in survival at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX> of
        the full-length

        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">THP-1</ENAMEX> coinfections with the original sur2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clone</ENAMEX>. In this
        coinfection, the ratio of white (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">sur2</NUMEX>) to yellow

        consistent with the above-described observations.
        A cosmid corresponding to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the sur3</TIMEX> clone was

        recovered cosmid was the same as the cosmid integrated in
        the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">sur3</NUMEX> genome (data not shown). The <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~10.7 kb cosmid</NUMEX> in
        the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">sur3</NUMEX> chromosome contains a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.76</NUMEX> kb fragment of

        To determine which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORF</ENAMEX>(s) was responsible for the
        increased survival exhibited by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sur3 bacteria</ENAMEX>, each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORF</ENAMEX> was
        subcloned individually into the expression vector pHIP. The
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> potential operons, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rv2233-Rv2235</ENAMEX> and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rv2238c-Rv2240c</ENAMEX>, were also subcloned
        into pHIP. The recombinant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> were examined for
        survival in the macrophage in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">coinfection</ENAMEX> experiments at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">0,</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12 hours</TIMEX> post phagocytosis (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>). Each of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">recombinants</ENAMEX> tested exhibited a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>:<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ratio of
        white-to-yellow <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">0 hours</TIMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recombinants</ENAMEX> demonstrated an increase in the ratio of
        white-to-yellow <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> over time, while the ratio
        remained at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1:1</ENAMEX> for the other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> recombinants. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> recombinants contained the potential operon of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rv2233-Rv2235</ENAMEX>, and the other
        contained 
        Rv2235 only. The ratio of
        white-to-yellow <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> expressing ORFs 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rv2233-Rv2235</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~2</NUMEX>:<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">6 hours</TIMEX> and
        ~<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">6:1 at 12 hours</TIMEX>. For <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> expressing 
        Rv2235, the ratio of white-to-yellow
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">colonies</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~2</NUMEX>:<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">6 hours</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">>3</NUMEX>:<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12 hours</TIMEX>. The
        survival of recombinant bacteria expressing the 
        Rv2235 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORF</ENAMEX> relative to wild-type was
        more directly compared to the relative survival of sur3 by
        doing the coinfections in parallel. The ratios of
        white-to-yellow for both recombinant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> and sur3
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> were <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1:1 at 0 hours</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~5</NUMEX>:<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12 hours</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">>5</NUMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>
        at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX>. The differences in the relative survival of
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> strains were not statistically significant.
        A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> fragment containing the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. tuberculosis ORFs</ENAMEX> 
        Rv2233 , 
        Rv2234 , and 
        Rv2235 without the upstream promoter
        region, was cloned into the pBPhin vector, which does not
        contain a promoter to express the inserted <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>. In
        coinfections with the 
        xylE -expressing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">recombinant bacteria</ENAMEX> containing 
        Rv2233 , 
        Rv2234 , and 
        Rv2235 did not exhibit the same
        increase in macrophage survival as the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">sur3</NUMEX> clone (data not
        shown), suggesting that the 
        Rv2235 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORF</ENAMEX> is expressed using signals
        upstream of the 
        Rv2233 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORF</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern</ENAMEX> blots of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genomic DNA</ENAMEX> from

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. smegmatis</ENAMEX> , 
        Mycobacterium leprae , and 
        Mycobacterium avium were probed with 
        Rv0365c and 
        Rv2235. Rv0365c <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hybridized</ENAMEX> to bands
        in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. tuberculosis</ENAMEX> ,

        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> smegmatis under high stringency
        conditions (data not shown). 
        Rv2235 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hybridized</ENAMEX> to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. tuberculosis</ENAMEX> , and under low
        stringency conditions recognized a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. leprae</ENAMEX> (data not shown).
        Database searches revealed that 
        Rv0365c encodes an ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41</NUMEX>-kDa protein
        which displays significant homology only to a truncated 
        Corynebacterium
        glutamicum hypothetical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> of unknown function
        (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">42%</NUMEX> identity in a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">296</NUMEX> aa overlap) located upstream of a
        gene encoding a fructose-bisphosphate aldolase. 
        Rv2235 encodes a conserved
        hypothetical membrane <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 30-kDa</NUMEX> and shares a
        motif with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SURF-1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. The other two
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX> in the putative 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rv2233-Rv2235</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">operon</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rv2233</ENAMEX> and
        Rv2234, share homology with several <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in data base
        searches. 
        Rv2233 may encode a putative
        phosphatase, and 
        Rv2234 may encode a low molecular
        weight <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein tyrosine phosphatase</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] .
      
      
        Discussion
        There are several potential limitations of isolating 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> tuberculosis <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> involved in
        intracellular survival using an enrichment procedure. One
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">limitation</ENAMEX> is that this protocol is biased towards the
        recovery of clones with the greatest increase in survival
        relative to wild-type [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . Thus, the recovered clones
        are not a random collection of genes involved in
        intracellular survival and hence the number of genes
        involved for survival cannot be calculated. This approach
        is also biased towards identifying genes expressing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that directly interfere with the antimicrobial
        processes of the macrophage. Some types of genes involved
        in resistance to killing, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> that are part of a
        multi-enzyme pathway, may not be isolated. Also, genes
        necessary for intracellular survival as opposed to
        resistance to killing are not likely to be isolated.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> general <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">classes</ENAMEX> of clones might be recovered
        following enrichment of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. smegmatis recombinant</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> for
        clones with increased intracellular survival. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> type
        might be clones that carry 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> tuberculosis genes that confer
        enhanced resistance to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">antimicrobial</ENAMEX> processes of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">macrophage</ENAMEX>. Another type might be clones whose 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> tuberculosis gene products are
        involved in attachment or invasion or increase
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phagocytosis</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> that were isolated in the
        studies reported here confer enhanced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> rather
        than increased uptake. That is, the ratios of bacteria
        expressing either 
        Rv0365c or 
        Rv2235 to wild-type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>
        in both the initial mixture and inside the macrophages at
        the end of the phagocytosis period. Differences in survival
        compared to wild-type did not become apparent until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about 9</TIMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> post-phagocytosis for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> expressing 
        Rv0365c and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">about 6 hours</TIMEX>
        post-phagocytosis for those expressing 
        Rv2235. 
        In this study, the enrichment process resulted in the
        isolation of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> strains containing small, integrated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">plasmids</ENAMEX> rather than the expected <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30-50</NUMEX> kb cosmids [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] .
        Small plasmids corresponding to the integrated ones were
        present in the original 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">pYUB178:H37Rv</ENAMEX>) cosmid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">library</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX>, sequencing, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern</ENAMEX> blot analysis
        demonstrated that the plasmid integrated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the sur2</TIMEX> clone
        was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 4</NUMEX> kb containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.1</NUMEX> kb of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> tuberculosis <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> and the plasmid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">integrated</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the sur3</TIMEX> clone was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 10.7</NUMEX> kb
        containing <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 5.7 kb</NUMEX> of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> tuberculosis <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>. Cosmid <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>
        frequently contain clones without <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> inserts [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] , so
        it is not too surprising that clones with small DNA
        fragments were present in the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> after infection with
        位 phage. The small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">plasmids</ENAMEX> may have a growth or
        replication advantage causing them to be over-represented
        in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> following the various amplification
        steps.
        The <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~2</NUMEX> kb deletion of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vector DNA</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the sur2</TIMEX> clone
        results in a fusion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORF</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">L5</NUMEX> integrase with
        that of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> tuberculosis insert such that the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fused ORF</ENAMEX> encodes a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> that contains only the
        amino-terminal <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">73</TIMEX> aa of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">344 aa L5</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">integrase</ENAMEX>. The
        observation that the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">sur2</NUMEX> clone contains an integrated
        plasmid corresponding to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">plasmid</ENAMEX> isolated from the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cosmid</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> suggests that either a) the hybrid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>
        retains integrase activity, b) the plasmid inserted into
        the attachment site by homologous recombination between 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">attP</ENAMEX> and 
        attB, or c) a functional integrase
        was provided in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">trans</ENAMEX> by a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> cosmid transiently
        present in the original transformant or by a gene present
        in the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> smegmatis <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">LR222</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">genome</ENAMEX>. However,
        repeated attempts to electroporate the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> kb plasmid into 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. smegmatis LR222</ENAMEX> did not generate
        any stable kanamycin-resistant transformants (data not
        shown). These results suggests that the hybrid <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> does
        not retain integrase activity, that integration by
        homologous recombination into 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">attP</ENAMEX> is unlikely, and that provision
        of integrase activity by an 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> smegmatis gene chromosomal does
        not occur. The simplest explanation is that integrase was
        provided 
        in trans by a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> cosmid
        transiently present in the original transformant, and
        indeed, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> smegmatis <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> carrying an
        integrated copy of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-kb plasmid can be readily isolated
        following electroporation of a mixture of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-kb plasmid
        and a plasmid that expresses integrase (unpublished
        results).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> base searches did not reveal any homologies that
        could be used to predict functions for the gene products of
        ORFs 
        Rv0365c or 
        Rv2235. Rv0365c encodes a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hypothetical protein</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">376</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> which displays
        significant homology only to a 
        Corynebacterium
        glutamicum hypothetical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> of unknown function
        (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">42%</NUMEX> identity in a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">296</NUMEX> aa overlap) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . 
        Rv2235 encodes a hypothetical protein
        of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">271</NUMEX> aa with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> putative transmembrane domains and
        which displays significant homology only to hypothetical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">protein MLCB1243.32c</ENAMEX> in 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M. leprae</ENAMEX>, to which it is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">74%</NUMEX>
        identical [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 25</NUMEX> ] . This 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> leprae homologue was evident in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern blot</ENAMEX> experiments done under low stringency
        conditions. Rv2235 also contains the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SURF-1</ENAMEX> signature
        sequence [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] and modest homology to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SURF-1</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SURF-1 protein</ENAMEX> of 
        Caulobacter crescentus (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX> identity;
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40%</NUMEX> similarity) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SURF-1 proteins</ENAMEX> are <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~33-kDa</NUMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">integral</ENAMEX> membrane <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> whose precise function is not
        known. In eukaryotic cells, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SURF-1 proteins</ENAMEX> are involved in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX> and maintenance of mitochondrial respiratory
        chain complexes including cytochrome oxidase [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 28</NUMEX> ] .
        The homology to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SURF-1 proteins</ENAMEX> raises the possibility that
        Rv2235 could play a role in resisting the antimicrobial

        the mutated

        The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> included: Rv3052c (probable 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nrdI</ENAMEX> ) which is postulated to be
        involved in deoxynucleotide production under stressed
        conditions; Rv0101 which is a nonribosomal peptide
        synthetase that displays strong homology with a 
        Pseudomonas nonribosomal peptide
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">synthetase</ENAMEX> required for the synthesis of the pyoveridine, a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">siderophore</ENAMEX> involved in iron <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">uptake</ENAMEX>; Rv3420c which displays
        homology with the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">S18 ribosomal protein</ENAMEX> acetyltransferase
        which behaves as a heat shock <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> in 
        Chlamydia trachomatis; and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rv0497</ENAMEX> and
        Rv3604c which are hypothetical <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">conserved</ENAMEX> membrane proteins
        of unknown function.
        It should be noted that these 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> tuberculosis <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> generally
        confer only a limited enhancement of the survival of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> smegmatis <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> in the human
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">macrophages</ENAMEX>. That is, usually only a few <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">per cent</NUMEX> of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX> are viable <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24 to 48 hours</TIMEX> post-infection. This
        reinforces the concept that the intracellular survival of a
        pathogenic mycobacteria is a complex multifactoral process.
        The precise role(s) of any of the identified genes in the
        intracellular survival of mycobacteria is not yet known,
        although several of the identified genes have features of
        stress response genes. This is not unexpected given the
        relatively small enhancements of the survival of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> smegmatis recombinants and the
        numerous environmental stresses encountered in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">macrophage</ENAMEX>. Additional studies, such as the construction
        and characterization of targeted knock-out mutants, will be
        needed to determine the roles of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> encoded by
        these genes in the survival of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> tuberculosis in human
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">macrophages</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Conclusions
        Using an enrichment and screening procedure, two 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> tuberculosis <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Rv0365c</ENAMEX> and
        Rv2235, were identified that could confer an enhanced
        ability to survive in human macrophages to normally
        susceptible 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> smegmatis <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">recipients</ENAMEX>. The
        functions of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are not known. This study
        brings the number of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> tuberculosis genetic loci that
        have been implicated in enhancing the intracellular
        survival of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.</ENAMEX> smegmatis cells to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>. The precise
        role(s) of any of the identified genes in the intracellular
        survival of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mycobacteria</ENAMEX> remain to be elucidated.

          Coinfection assay to measure survival
          Coinfection assays were done as previously described [

          portions were plated on TSA plates. The cultures which
          were assayed immediately after the addition of the media
          with amikacin serve to measure of the number of
          phagocytosed viable <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>; the time at which these
          cultures were assayed was considered time <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> (t

          from the recombinant <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> (white). Storing the plates
          overnight at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4掳C</TIMEX> results in a stronger yellow color. To
