        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Passive</ENAMEX> leg elevation (PLE) is a common manoeuvre
        performed to prepare the sterile field in several surgical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">specialities</ENAMEX> (coronary surgery, vascular and orthopaedic
        surgery), to facilitate surgical exposure (gynaecologic and
        urologic surgery) or to treat acute hypotension. It is well
        known that this postural change induces some haemodynamic
        modifications represented by the shift of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> from the
        legs into the central circulation, by the increase in the
        venous return and by the improvement in systemic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">haemodynamics</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2, 3, 4</ENAMEX>]. These effects are more
        pronounced under general anaesthesia because of the larger
        blood sequestration into the peripheral higher compliant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">venous</ENAMEX> system, as a result of the loss in the muscular and
        vascular tone induced by the anaesthetic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2</ENAMEX>]. If
        the manoeuvre can be utilized to treat acute hypotension
        due to hypovolaemia, it could not be as beneficial in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> with a compromised right ventricle, where acute
        volume loading may lead to a further deterioration of the
        right ventricular function [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5, 6, 7</ENAMEX>].
        Many experimental and clinical studies have shown,
        however, that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLE</ENAMEX> has no or little haemodynamic benefit in
        normovolaemic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with a stable cardiocirculatory
        status [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2, 8, 9, 10, 11</ENAMEX>]. Studying the haemodynamic
        effects of the manoeuvre in anaesthetized coronary patients
        with a rapid-response thermistor pulmonary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">artery</ENAMEX> catheter
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reich</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . concluded that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLE</ENAMEX> results in
        minor haemodynamic improvement, in right ventricular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dilatation</ENAMEX> and in right ventricular ejection fraction
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RVEF</ENAMEX>) decrease [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>]. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX>, however, did not
        differentiate between the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with a normal right
        ventricular function and those with a reduced right
        ventricular function. For this reason, we planned our study
        in order to evaluate the effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLE</ENAMEX> on the right
        ventricle with the same technique, comparing a group of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with a preinduction RVEF > <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">45%</NUMEX> with a second
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with preinduction RVEF < <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40%</NUMEX>.
      
      
        Methods
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twenty</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coronary patients</ENAMEX> scheduled for elective
        myocardial revascularization were studied after the study
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">protocol</ENAMEX> was approved by the local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ethics Committee</ENAMEX> and the
        written informed consent was obtained from each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>.
        The admission criteria to the study were stable
        preoperative cardiocirculatory conditions without
        intravenous cardiovascular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>, no evidence of valvular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pulmonary hypertension</ENAMEX>, a normal sinus rhythm,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">normovolaemia</ENAMEX> and no diuretic therapy.
        Preoperative <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cardiac</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications (β-blockers</ENAMEX>, calcium
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">channel</ENAMEX> blockers, nitroglycerin) were continued until the
        day of surgery.
        All <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were premedicated with intramuscular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">morphine</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX>) and scopolamine (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.005</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX>) <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">60 min</TIMEX>
        before entering the operating <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX>. They were monitored by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">electrocardiogram</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">D II</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">V5</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ST</ENAMEX> segment analysis), by
        radial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">artery cannula</ENAMEX>, and by a thermodilution RVEF
        pulmonary artery catheter (model <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">93/A-432H-7.5F</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baxter</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Edwards Healthcare Laboratories</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Ana</ENAMEX>, CA, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>)
        positioned before induction under local anaesthesia.
        General anaesthesia was induced with etomidate (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.15</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">mg/kg</ENAMEX>), fentanyl (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5 μg/kg</ENAMEX>) and vecuronium (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX>), and
        was maintained during the study with a continuous infusion
        of midazolam (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8-10 mg/hour</TIMEX>). Mechanical ventilation was
        provided with an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX>/air mixture, and was adjusted to
        maintain the arterial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon dioxide</ENAMEX> tension between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> and
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">40 mmHg</TIMEX> and to maintain the arterial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> tension higher
        than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> mmHg. No level of positive end-expiratory pressure
        was applied. During the study, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2-3 ml/</ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg fluids per hour</NUMEX>
        were administered to all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and no other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> was
        used. After endotracheal intubation, a two-dimensional
        transoesophageal echocardiography <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> was introduced into
        the oesophagus. The probe was connected to an
        ultrasonograph device (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Color Doppler</ENAMEX>, model <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SSD-830</ENAMEX>; Aloka
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Company</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX>) and videorecording of
        two-dimensional transoesophageal echocardiography images
        were made for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later</TIMEX> analysis.
        A complete haemodynamic profile was performed before
        induction of anaesthesia (time point <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>), just before (time
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">point 2</ENAMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 min</NUMEX> (time point <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) after the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> had
        their legs simultaneously raised at an angle of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60°</NUMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">min</ENAMEX> after the legs were lowered (time point <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). The
        pressure data at each time were recorded (the right
        intraventricular pressures advancing the pulmonary artery
        catheter until the proximal port entered the ventricular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chamber</ENAMEX>) and were then followed by injection of iced <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glucose solution</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the end of the expiratory time</TIMEX>, until
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> values of cardiac output within <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> of each other
        were obtained.
        Each haemodynamic profile consisted of data recorded by
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hewlett Packard</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Palo Alto</ENAMEX>, CA, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USA</ENAMEX>) monitor (model
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7853</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C</ENAMEX>) and registered on a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hewlett Packard</ENAMEX>
        strip chart recorder, and data recorded by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Explorer</ENAMEX>
        computer (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baxter Edwards Healthcare Laboratories</ENAMEX>).
        The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> profile measured the heart rate, the systolic
        systemic pressure, the diastolic systemic pressure, the
        mean systemic pressure, the mean pulmonary pressure, the
        pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, the central venous
        pressure, the right ventricular diastolic pressure, the
        right ventricular end diastolic pressure measured at the
        interception of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> point in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QRS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> with the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intraventricular</ENAMEX> pressure trace [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>], and the right
        ventricular systolic pressure. The right ventricular end
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systolic</ENAMEX> pressure was not measured because the dicrotic
        notch on the pulmonary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">artery</ENAMEX> pressure wave was very often
        not evident. All pressures were measured on the strip chart
        at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the end of the expiratory time</TIMEX>.
        The other profile measured the right ventricular end
        diastolic volume, the right ventricular end systolic
        volume, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RVEF</ENAMEX> and the cardiac output.
        The derived parameters then calculated were the cardiac
        index, the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> volume index, the right ventricular end
        diastolic volume index (RVEDVI) and the right ventricular
        end systolic volume index (RVESVI), the right ventricular
        end diastolic volume/pressure ratio (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RVED</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V/P</ENAMEX>), the right
        ventricular stroke work index, the pressure gradient
        between systolic systemic pressure and right ventricular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systolic</ENAMEX> pressure (Δ 
        p 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSP/RVSP</ENAMEX> ) and the pressure gradient
        between diastolic systemic pressure and the mean right
        ventricular diastolic pressure (the mean value between
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diastolic</ENAMEX> and end diastolic right ventricular pressures) (Δ
        
        p 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DSP/mRVDP</ENAMEX> ).
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were divided into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> on the basis
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">RVEF</ENAMEX> measured at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">time</TIMEX> point <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>: the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> of group
        A had RVEF > <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">45%</NUMEX>, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> of group B had RVEF
        < <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40%</NUMEX>.
        Statistical analysis was performed by two-way analysis
        of variance test for repeated measures with a Bonferroni
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">correction,</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 0.05</ENAMEX> was considered
        significant. Results are expressed as mean ± standard
        deviation.
      
      
        Results
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Sixteen patients</ENAMEX> completed the study protocol. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> from each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>) were excluded because of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arrhythmias</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>), because of intravenous
        administration of nitroglycerin for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">angina</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>)
        and because of moderate tricuspid regurgitation at time
        point 3 (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>).
        The general characteristics of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> are reported
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>. There are no significant differences between
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> regarding age, left ventricular ejection
        fraction, preoperative therapy and the number of right and
        left coronary stenoses.
        Comparing the basal values between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bedside RVEF</ENAMEX>, the heart rate ( 
        P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.01</NUMEX>), the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RVEDVI</ENAMEX>, the RVESVI
        ( 
        P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.007</NUMEX>) and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RVED</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V/P</ENAMEX> ( 
        P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.01</NUMEX>) were significantly
        higher in group B than in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> A (time point <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>).
        This statistical difference persisted at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">time</TIMEX> point <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX> only
        for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RVEF</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RVEDVI</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RVESVI</ENAMEX>.
        The PLE induced similar changes in heart rate, which
        decreased significantly, in both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> and induced similar
        changes in the majority of the pressure values (central
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">venous</ENAMEX> pressure, right ventricular diastolic pressure,
        right ventricular end diastolic pressure, pulmonary
        capillary wedge pressure), which increased significantly at
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> point <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> compared with time point 2 (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). On the
        contrary, the systolic systemic pressure, the diastolic
        systemic pressure, the mean systemic pressure and the mean
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pulmonary</ENAMEX> pressure increased significantly only in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> A
        at the same time point.
        The main differences between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> after the
        legs were raised are represented, however, by the changes
        in the data regarding volumes (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> A, at
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> point <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> versus time point <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, in the face of a slight
        and not significant increase in cardiac index, we observed
        a significant increase in the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> volume index ( 
        P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.003</NUMEX>), the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RVEDVI</ENAMEX> ( 
        P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.008</NUMEX>) and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RVESVI</ENAMEX> ( 
        P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.006</NUMEX>). However, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RVEF</ENAMEX> was
        unchanged and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RVED</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V/P</ENAMEX> slightly decreased.
        Moreover, the right ventricular stroke work index ( 
        P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.01</NUMEX>), the Δ 
        p 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSP/RVSP</ENAMEX> ( 
        P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.01</NUMEX>) and the Δ 
        p 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DSP/mRVDP</ENAMEX> ( 
        P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.009</NUMEX>) significantly increased
        at the same time. At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">time</TIMEX> point <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, the Δ 
        p 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DSP</ENAMEX>/mRVDP change was statistically
        significant between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>.
        An opposite haemodynamic behaviour was observed at time
        point <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> in group <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B.</ENAMEX> In fact, while the cardiac index
        remained stable and the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> volume index increased
        slightly, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RVEDVI</ENAMEX> ( 
        P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.04</NUMEX>) and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RVED</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V/P</ENAMEX> ( 
        P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.02</NUMEX>) significantly decreased.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RVEF</ENAMEX> increased and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RVESVI</ENAMEX> decreased, but not
        significantly. No significant change was recorded in the
        right ventricular stroke work index, the Δ 
        p 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSP/RVSP</ENAMEX> and the Δ 
        p 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DSP/mRVDP</ENAMEX> .
        The graphic representation of the relationship between
        right ventricular end diastolic volume and right
        ventricular end diastolic pressure shows the upward and
        left side movement of this ratio in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> of group
        A, and shows the upward and right side movement in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> of group B (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). After the legs had been
        lowered, the haemodynamic parameters (time point <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) nearly
        returned to the same values recorded at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">time</TIMEX> point <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>.
        The transoesophageal echocardiographic images did not
        show any episode of tricuspid regurgitation, and no
        apparent displacement of the interventricular septum in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who completed the study protocol.
        No <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ST</ENAMEX> segment change was observed in any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> at the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> times of the study.
      
      
        Discussion
        Many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> have examined the haemodynamic
        effects of passive leg raising with different monitoring
        techniques. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Wong</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al .</ENAMEX>, using thoracic bioimpedence,
        showed a small but significant increase in cardiac index
        after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLE</ENAMEX> in awake <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Society of</ENAMEX>
        Anaesthesiologists score index <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">III</ENAMEX>) undergoing
        elective <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">operations</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>]. Rutlen 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al .</ENAMEX>, using nuclear scintigraphy,
        reported that <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">150 ml or less</NUMEX> of blood transferred to the
        intravascular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">space</ENAMEX> after leg elevation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>]. Kyriakides 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al .</ENAMEX>, employing a Doppler
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">echocardiographic</ENAMEX> technique, showed that the postural
        change increases preload and cardiac performance in
        normovolaemic coronary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>]. However, studying
        the effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLE</ENAMEX> on anaesthetized coronary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> by a
        rapid-response <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pulmonary artery</ENAMEX> catheter for measurement of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RVEF</ENAMEX> and volumes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reich</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . found no improvement in
        cardiac performance [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>].
        Our results are in agreement with the conclusions drawn
        by the previous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX>; in fact, a slight increase or no
        increase in cardiac index was seen in all the patients
        studied. The haemodynamic response of the right ventricle
        to the postural change was quite different in the two
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, however, according to the basal right
        ventricular function recorded before the induction of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">anaesthesia</ENAMEX>.
        In the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with a higher basal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RVEF</ENAMEX> and lower right
        ventricular volumes, the haemodynamic behaviour was similar
        to that described by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reich</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>]. The right ventricular
        end diastolic volume increased more than the right
        ventricular end systolic volume and, as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RVEF</ENAMEX> did not
        change, the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> volume increased. The cardiac index
        increased only slightly because of the reduction in the
        heart rate.
        Moreover, the rise in right ventricular end diastolic
        pressure did not significantly affect right ventricular
        compliance [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>], to which myocardial wall <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> consumption are inversely related [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5, 17</ENAMEX>], because
        the pressure increase was proportional to that of the end
        diastolic volume. The significant increase in the pressure
        gradient between radial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">artery</ENAMEX> pressures (generally equal
        to aortic pressures) and the right intraventricular
        pressures, whose gradient is considered a good index of
        coronary perfusion pressure [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>], may have improved the
        right coronary driving pressure. All these findings lead us
        to conclude that leg elevation induced a favourable
        condition in the right ventricle of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
        On the contrary, with the right ventricles dilated and a
        lower basal ejection fraction, the manoeuvre of raising the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">legs</ENAMEX> was followed by a decrease in end diastolic volume
        index and end systolic volume index, and by a small
        increase in ejection fraction and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> volume, while the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cardiac</ENAMEX> index was unchanged because of the reduction in the
        heart rate. The reduction of the ventricular size seemed to
        be advantageous because, according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank-Starling</ENAMEX>
        relationship, the right ventricle accomplished the same
        work with a smaller end diastolic volume and a shorter
        fibre length [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18, 19</TIMEX>]. The concomitant increase in the
        right ventricular end diastolic pressure, however, led to a
        marked reduction in the right ventricular compliance, with
        adverse effects on ventricular wall <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX> and oxygen
        consumption [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5, 16, 17</ENAMEX>].
        Another difference in group B was the lack of increase
        in the pressure gradient between the radial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">artery</ENAMEX> and the
        right ventricular cavity after the legs were raised. This
        haemodynamic event, combined with stability in the cardiac
        index, did not offer a significant gain to the right
        ventricular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> supply.
        We have to underline, however, that the conclusions
        drawn on the right ventricular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> supply/demand ratio
        in the two loading conditions are mainly speculative. This
        is because they are deduced from indirect indicators
        (intraventricular volumes and pressures) of the myocardial
        metabolic balance, and they do not allow a direct
        measurement of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> supplied or extracted by the
        heart [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5, 6, 16, 17</ENAMEX>]. Nevertheless, we believe that the
        variations of the parameters measured in our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> can
        help the anaesthesiologist and the intensivist to
        understand or to predict the physiopathological changes
        that occur in the right ventricle after the legs are
        raised, also because the haemodynamic data used can be
        easily available in the clinical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">anaesthesiological</ENAMEX> and
        intensive care setting.
        Our protocol included the ejection fraction as a tool to
        divide the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> on the basis of the right ventricular
        function. This parameter shows important limitations as an
        index of ventricular function. In fact, ejection fraction
        is preload and afterload dependent, and it correlates
        poorly with myocardial contractility. It is therefore not a
        specific parameter, since its variation is due to the
        changes of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or more of the related factors (preload,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">afterload</ENAMEX> or contractility) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20, 21</TIMEX>]. Ejection fraction,
        more than a measurement of ventricular performance, can
        consequently be considered as a measurement of the
        integrated cardiovascular system in dealing with a
        pathological process [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>]. However, in spite of these
        limitations, we used the ejection fraction to define the
        basal right ventricular function of our <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, because
        this parameter is measured by the pulmonary catheter we
        used and because it is the one we use in our clinical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">department</ENAMEX> for this purpose.
        The attempt to correlate the haemodynamic response of
        the right ventricle to leg elevation with the degree and
        the number of right coronary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">artery stenoses</ENAMEX> was
        unsuccessful because the coronary obstructions were equally
        distributed in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. It would therefore not have
        been possible to predict from the coronarographic data the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">haemodynamic</ENAMEX> changes of the right ventricle that followed
        the passive leg raising manoeuvre.
        When analysing the haemodynamic data, a difficulty can
        arise in interpreting the pulmonary capillary wedge
        pressure increase; whether this change is due to an
        increase in left ventricular preload that follows the
        increase in venous return, or to a decrease in left
        ventricular compliance as a result of the leftward shift of
        the interventricular septum for right ventricular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dilatation</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16, 22</TIMEX>]. As the wedge pressure also increased
        in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> of group B, whose right ventricular volume
        decreased after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLE</ENAMEX>, and the transoesophageal
        echocardiographic images did not show any apparent shift of
        the interventricular septum in all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>, we conclude
        that the increase in preload may have been the probable
        explanation for this haemodynamic change.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medication drugs</ENAMEX> given to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> before
        surgery (nitroglycerin, β-blockers, calcium <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX>)
        and the anaesthetic treatment (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>, mechanical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ventilation</ENAMEX>) may have interfered significantly with the
        cardiovascular function and the haemodynamic data recorded
        at the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">time</TIMEX> points of the study [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23, 24, 25, 26, 27</TIMEX>].
        However, as the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> administered before surgery were
        distributed equally in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> and the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">anaesthesiological</ENAMEX> treatment was the same for all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>,
        we believe that this interference can be considered
        negligible in the evaluation of the haemodynamic
        differences observed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> studied.
        Concerning the data recorded by the thermodilution right
        ventricular ejection fraction pulmonary <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">artery</ENAMEX> catheter,
        the absence of episodes of tricuspid regurgitation (a
        condition that can lead to underestimating cardiac output
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RVEF</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6, 12, 28</ENAMEX>]) made those parameters reliable and
        comparable with the parameters recorded before the
        elevation of the legs.
        Another limitation of the present study is represented
        by the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> studied, which should be larger
        to have more statistical weight and to provide additional
        support for definitive conclusions. However, in spite of
        the limitations described and the expectation of further
        investigations confirming our results, we conclude that the
        manoeuvre of leg elevation, necessary to prepare the
        sterile field in several surgical specialities (coronary,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vascular</ENAMEX> and orthopaedic surgery) or to position the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> for some gynaecologic and urologic procedures, must
        be performed slowly and progressively in normovolaemic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coronary patients</ENAMEX> with a reduced right ventricular function
        because it could decompensate the already poor balance of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> supply/demand in the right ventricle.
        We finally suggest that, as the main physiopathological
        changes of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLE</ENAMEX> are caused by the increase in venous return
        to the right ventricle and they are common to those induced
        by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fluids</ENAMEX>, the manoeuvre of fluid
        loading should be performed cautiously and progressively in
        such coronary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. Even if this statement seems
        obvious and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> have drawn the same conclusions [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>], further work needs to be carried out in this area to
        confirm such a hypothesis.
