        In the past, animal <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> in the study of disc
        degeneration have most commonly involved <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">dogs</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">monkeys</ENAMEX>, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sheep</ENAMEX>, but in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX> the sand <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> ( 
        Psammomys obesus ) has been used
        because of the economic advantages of rodent <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX>. The
        spontaneous age-related degeneration of the sand rat spine
        avoids the need for chemonucleolysis or surgical injury to
        induce disc degeneration. The age-related disc degeneration
        in the sand <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> has been shown to be reliable and
        predictable, and has been well characterized in previous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">radiologic</ENAMEX> studies [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9</NUMEX> ] . The present work
        extends the previous radiological studies in [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] to
        develop an automated computer-assisted procedure that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">analyses digitized lateral x-rays</ENAMEX> of the sand rat
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">spine</ENAMEX>.
        To create such a system, the task of locating the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vertebrae</ENAMEX> in the image is vital. For this task, previous
        works in x-ray analysis were consulted and several
        possibilities were initially considered. The main
        techniques in previous research used active shape models,
        both customized and deformable. Extensive research has been
        done by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Long</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11 12</NUMEX> ] to automatically identify and
        classify spinal vertebrae. Others whose work includes the
        use of active shape models for vertebrae analysis are Smyth
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zamor</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . Although the adaptability of
        active shape <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> is important, b-spline techniques are
        also valuable [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . These techniques (which are adequate
        in the analysis of human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">spines</ENAMEX>) were not selected in the
        present study because they still require <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX> intervention,
        and our objective was to develop a completely automated
        approach to the study of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral</ENAMEX> films.
        The specific goal of this study was to create an
        efficient automated method of identifying the overall angle
        of curvature of the spine, the angles between individual
        vertebrae, the distance between vertebrae, and a scoring
        index for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sclerosis</ENAMEX> present in the vertebral end plates
        (which may be a major factor in reducing the nutrition
        available to the aging disc). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Resultant</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> data
        are presented both graphically and numerically to
        illustrate the computer methods which are utilized. The
        major emphasis of this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot</ENAMEX> study was to accurately
        identify each of the vertebrae and then to obtain selected
        measurements. The techniques presented here may have
        potential to produce quantitative algorithms that create
        more accurate and informative studies and measurements in a
        time efficient manner.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Finding the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Location of the Spine</ENAMEX> in the
          Image
          In order to analyse the vertebrae, first the location
          of the spine in the image must be found. In each of the
          images, the location and angle of the spine can be
          clearly detected by finding the well-defined soft-tissue
          boundary of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX> itself. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step in finding
          this boundary was to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">de</ENAMEX>-noise the image using an adaptive
          Wiener filter [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 17 18</NUMEX> ] . The goal was to minimize the
          amount of noise in the black area corresponding to the
          area outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>. Next, Canny edge detection [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ]
          was applied to obtain a binary image representing the
          edges in the X-ray. The reason the Canny edge detector
          was chosen over other edge detectors is because it is
          still a basic filter, but also applies a Gaussian
          smoothing filter before its edge detection algorithm. The
          strength of the edges detected is also controlled with
          this detection system, which helps to enhance precision.
          The Canny edge detector can be briefly described using
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Equation 1</ENAMEX> developed to detect the local maxima in the
          direction perpendicular to the edge.
          
          In <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Equation 1, ƒ</ENAMEX> represents the image, 
          G is a 2D <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gaussian</ENAMEX> filleting
          operation, and the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> directional derivative is taken
          along the normal vector 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> . Using this edge-detected image,
          the boundary was traced and the angles of its curvature
          recorded, as shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>.
          The process to this point generated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> important sets
          of information. First, a set of points along the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>'s
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">boundary</ENAMEX> was obtained, which gives a good estimate for
          locating the vertebrae. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, a set of angles that
          gives an estimate of how the underlying vertebrae are
          oriented was obtained.
        
        
          Segmenting the Image
          Next, with the data that provided the position and
          orientation of the spine, it was necessary to segment the
          image based on orientation. The purpose of this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">segmentation</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>-fold. First, the image must be
          broken into smaller portions for histogram equalization
          and contrast adjustment. Because the image varies in
          quality and clarity in different portions of the image,
          details visible in one portion of the image may not be
          clearly identifiable in other portions. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>
          purpose segmentation served was to limit the search space
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">line segments</ENAMEX> (see below).
          The boundary points from the previous step were used
          to determine where the image was to be segmented. The
          locations of these points for segmentation and their
          angles of curvature are shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>.
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3shows</NUMEX> the results of Canny edge detection [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX>
          ] before the image was segmented. The edges of the end
          plates were not clearly visible because different
          threshold values needed to be used for separate portions
          of the image. A threshold value applied to the entire
          image can neglect needed information and may detect more
          noise than the true edges.
          The image was segmented in locations where the change
          in orientation of the detected boundary became greater
          than <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty degrees</TIMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). A <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX>-pixel overlap
          between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segments</ENAMEX> was used to avoid accidentally missing
          features that lie near segment boundaries. From this
          point, each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> was processed independently (Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Reductions or Elimination of Segment
          Background
          In order to obtain an image where the vertebrae were
          clearly defined, it was necessary to eliminate as much of
          the background noise and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">objects</ENAMEX> in the image as
          possible. High-boost filters as well as histogram
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">equalization</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] were both tested for this process.
          While both techniques required some logic to determine
          the best values for filtering the image, histogram
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">equalization</ENAMEX> appeared to be the stronger of the two
          techniques as it allowed an analysis of the distribution
          of intensities in the image and adjusted the histogram
          accordingly. Histogram equalization can be briefly
          described using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Equation 2</ENAMEX>:
          
          where 
          g is the original grey level, <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">ƒ</NUMEX>( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g</ENAMEX> ) is the equalized 
          G 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> 
           is the maximum grey level, 
          A 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">0</ENAMEX> is the area of the image and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">u</ENAMEX> ) is the histogram.
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6shows</NUMEX> the effects of the histogram
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">equalization</ENAMEX>. The equalization highlighted the
          distinction of vertebrae vs. the surrounding tissues,
          making the vertebrae more visible and the boundaries more
          identifiable. This step also normalized the images,
          reducing the variance among the images for the measuring
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sclerosis</ENAMEX>, and helped increase the accuracy of the
          edge detection, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hough</ENAMEX> transform [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] discussed
          below.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Locating Vertebral End</ENAMEX> Plates
          The image was segmented such that each segment
          contained vertebrae of similar orientation. Each
          segment's histogram was also manipulated such that the
          vertebrae were well defined. The remaining processing
          steps can be described as follows:
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. First, Canny edge detection [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] was performed on
          the image <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX>. This time, threshold values that
          specifically eliminated the false edges were used. The
          false edges were a result of noise and other edges in the
          image that were not part of the spine. These threshold
          values were based on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX>'s histogram from the
          previous step. The objective was to preserve the edges of
          the end plates while at the same time eliminating as many
          of the other extraneous edges as possible.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. Once the edge image was produced, it underwent a
          Radon transform [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Radon</ENAMEX> transform of a binary
          image is essentially a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hough</ENAMEX> transform [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . The Hough
          transform (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>) gives an idea of where lines are
          located in an image by counting consecutive points in
          each direction. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hough</ENAMEX> transform was used because it
          was originally designed to detect straight lines with no
          prior knowledge of the region being necessary. The theory
          behind the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hough</ENAMEX> transform is as follows [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . All
          lines going through a given point can be represented by
          one equation
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">y</ENAMEX> 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1</TIMEX> = 
          kx 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> + 
          q 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Equation 3</ENAMEX> 
          for some values of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> and 
          q . Meaning that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eq</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> can be taken
          as an equation in the parameter space 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX>, q , thus all the lines through a
          given point A can be represented by
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">q = -</ENAMEX> 
          x 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> + 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">y</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Equation 4</ENAMEX> 
          and all the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">lines</ENAMEX> passing through a given point B can
          be represented by
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">q = -</ENAMEX> 
          x 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> + 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">y</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Equation 5</ENAMEX> 
          Then the only common point on both lines in the 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX>, q parameter space is the point
          in the image that represents the only existing line
          between points A and B. The goal is to determine all
          possible line pixels, and transform the lines that go
          through the pixels into points in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX>, q space, and to detect the
          points ( 
          a , 
          b ) that result from the Hough
          transform of lines 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">y</ENAMEX> = 
          ax + 
          b in the image.
          The directions searched in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hough</ENAMEX> transform were
          constrained by using the angles that provided the basis
          for segmentation. This eliminated many of the false line
          detections by limiting the orientations allowed.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. The best <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">line candidates</ENAMEX> of all those produced by
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hough</ENAMEX> transform were selected (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>). These lines
          matched the location and orientation of each of the
          vertebral end plates. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">line candidates</ENAMEX> located near
          each selected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> intersect near or at the midpoint
          of the end plate edge. This allowed accurate estimation
          of the midpoint of each end plate. These midpoints were
          then used for accurately finding the orientation and
          location of individual vertebrae.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. A new index of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sclerosis</ENAMEX> to describe the amount of
          calcification on each vertebra was introduced as:
          
          This index is a relation between the intensity of the
          vertebra at an end plate, and the intensity of the
          vertebra at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>. In the image, the higher the
          intensity value, the more bony <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sclerosis</ENAMEX> is present
          (i.e., the degree of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sclerosis</ENAMEX> is greater). As a note,
          this index is only a measurement; no interpretations are
          made at this point.
        
      
      
        Results
        
          Overall Curvature
          Overall curvature was determined as the difference
          between the orientations of the beginning and ending
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vertebra</ENAMEX> and is shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>. (This measurement could
          have also been modelled with <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">circle detection</ENAMEX> where the
          spine represents a segment of the circle.)
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Angles of Individual</ENAMEX> Vertebra
          An estimation of this measurement was obtained by
          using the output of the line detection method described
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section 2</ENAMEX> and shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>. This gives an
          indication of the midpoints of the end plates as well as
          the orientation of those end plates. This information
          resulted to the slope from the midpoint of one end plate
          to the midpoint of the other. The angles of the vertebrae
          are given by the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">'Orientation Angle"</ENAMEX> column, in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>.
          Since not every end plate could be found with the line
          detection method, the shape detection methods provide a
          more reliable basis for this measurement.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Distances Between Vertebras</ENAMEX>
          The distance between the vertebrae was determined by
          finding the pixel length of the vertebrae and the pixel
          length of the gap between their left neighbouring
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vertebrae</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>, the vertebral length and the pixel
          space between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vertebrae</ENAMEX> are given by the 'Vertebra
          Length' and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">'Space'</ENAMEX>, respectively.
        
        
          Index of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Sclerosis</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">End</ENAMEX> Plates
          This measurement of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sclerosis</ENAMEX> was a ratio between the
          average pixel intensity near the center of a vertebra and
          the pixel intensity at each end plate (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">calculated by Equation 1</ENAMEX>. The histogram equalization was
          essential for these calculations, so there will not be a
          high degree of variance between subsequent images. The
          index value for the left end cap compared to the center
          is the 'Sclerosis <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Upper Index</ENAMEX>' column, and the index
          value for the right end cap compared to the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> is the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'Sclerosis Lower Index</ENAMEX>' column in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        The results generated from this new application of
        computer analysis applied to a small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of
        representative x-rays indicate that the computer-aided
        method developed here is practical for automated
        calculation and analysis of the overall curvature of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">spine</ENAMEX>, individual vertebra angles, vertebral spacing, and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sclerosis measurement</ENAMEX>. The computational techniques can
        also provide quantitative means that can then be used to
        explore the relation between age and conformation of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vertebrae</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> most important steps in the process
        reported here are the location of the edges of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vertebrae</ENAMEX> and the location of the midpoints of the end
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">plates</ENAMEX>. Future applications of the techniques developed
        here could potentially be applied to either human or large
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal radiographs</ENAMEX>. The proposed method can be applied to
        further our methods of analysis in animal models of
        important features of spine aging such as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sclerosis</ENAMEX> of the
        vertebral end plates.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bernick</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cailliet</ENAMEX> have suggested that <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sclerosis</ENAMEX> of
        the end plate may act to impede nutrient flow into the disc
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] , and that progressive end plate <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sclerosis</ENAMEX> with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">aging</ENAMEX> contributed to disc degeneration. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Concomitantly,</ENAMEX>
        however, disc degeneration, by changing stress patterns on
        end plate bone, may also cause increases in bone density in

        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 27</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Modic et al</ENAMEX> have provided the major clinical
        study of end plates in degenerating discs [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] . They
        reported that discs which showed in an MRI a decrease in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> intensity on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">T1</NUMEX>-weighted spin-echo images and
        increased signal intensity on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">T2</NUMEX>-weighted images (Modic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">type 1</ENAMEX>) exhibited disruption and fissuring of the end
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">plates</ENAMEX>. Endplates showed woven bone, thick trabeculae with
        active bone remodeling, and fibrous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">marrow</ENAMEX>. Modic type 2
        MRI changes, characterized by increased signal intensity on
        T1-weighted images and isointense or slightly increased
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> intensity on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">T2</NUMEX>-weighted images), showed a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">progression</ENAMEX> to disrupted end plates and reactive bone
        tissue and the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fatty marrow</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Conclusions
        Performing accurate analysis of vertebrae based on
        radiographic images is a challenging image processing task.
        The automated system presented here applies robust image
        processing techniques to find important measures of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">degeneration</ENAMEX> in the aging spine, such as separation and
        angle between vertebrae, measurement of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sclerosis</ENAMEX>, and
        orientation of vertebrae. The main advantages of this
        method are that unlike <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>, the computer can make exact
        quantitative measurements, the computer is not subjective
        (does not depend on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigator</ENAMEX>), it provides faster
        analysis, and the image quality can be improved before
        analysis to allow more accurate measurements. The main
        disadvantages are that the X-ray must be digitized
        producing extra costs and complexity, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> might use
        certain heuristics that cannot be directly translated into
        mathematical methods for the computer to imitate.
        Some limitations to the method include, that the overall
        accuracy is dependant on the quality of data used, the
        orientation of the spine in the image must be within a
        certain degree to be analyzed, and a large data set is
        necessary to be able to usefully interpret the measurements
        generated. The main <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of error that were identified
        are the fact that the lower the quality of the input image,
        the higher the chance for miss-measurements because the
        identification of the landmark features may be incorrect,
        and that the overall orientation measurements can be
        incorrect due to the orientation and location of the spine
        in the images. In addition, the method can be used to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">quantitatively</ENAMEX> study the relation between the age and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vertebral</ENAMEX> changes. This automated system can greatly
        enhance the research on spine and disc degeneration in sand
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> and other rodent <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">models</ENAMEX> that provide an economically
        attractive alternative to large <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> studies.
