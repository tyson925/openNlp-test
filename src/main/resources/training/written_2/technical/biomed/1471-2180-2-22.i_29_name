        The detection of microbial life in extraterrestrial
        locations is an important goal of human exploration of
        space because of ecological and health concerns about
        possible contamination of other planets with earthly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">organisms</ENAMEX>, and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice</ENAMEX> versa [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] . Several indirect
        methods for detecting extraterrestrial life have been
        proposed in the prior literature. These include (a)
        examining the ratios of stable isotopes in important
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon</ENAMEX> and sulphur for discrimination
        against heavy isotopes and selective use of the lighter
        isotopes, (b) microscopic observations of highly organized
        or specifically-shaped structures [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4</NUMEX> ] , (c) examination
        of soils for the presence of specific types of organic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">moieties</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] , and (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">d</ENAMEX>) the detection of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">chiral</ENAMEX> molecules
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">extraterrestrial samples</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7 8 9 10 11 12</NUMEX> ] .
        Previously we suggested a thermodynamic approach to the
        detection of life. Since living <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX> require a
        continual source of usable energy, we should be able to
        detect a chemical signature of life in the form of mixtures
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">redox</ENAMEX> molecules such as porphyrins, quinones, and
        flavins that transport electrons along redox gradients
        between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">electron donors</ENAMEX> and acceptors [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . We examined
        methods to extract and detect the components of electron
        transport <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX> that might be used to indicate the
        presence of life on site in extraterrestrial locations. Our
        experiments showed this to be a promising approach, though
        instrument development and miniaturization for this purpose
        will be challenging [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] .
        Here we discuss the possibility of a related, but
        simpler approach for detecting life that will measure the
        actual existence of functioning electron transport <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX>.
        This can theoretically be done remotely and on site using
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">robotically</ENAMEX> collected extraterrestrial soil <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX>. The
        method involves detection of actual activity of respiratory
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electron</ENAMEX> transport using artificial electron acceptors such
        as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DCIP</ENAMEX> and tetrazolium dyes such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XTT</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DCIP</ENAMEX>, for
        example, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couples</ENAMEX> directly with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NADH</ENAMEX> or NADPH to form DCIPH 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NAD</ENAMEX> +or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NADP</ENAMEX> +, making it an ideal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electron</ENAMEX> transport <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> indicator [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XTT</ENAMEX> has been
        used to measure microbial respiratory activity in complex
        natural environments [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . Respiratory dyes have been
        used commercially for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many years</TIMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Biolog™</ENAMEX> system to
        help identify pure cultures of microorganisms by their
        patterns of oxidation of multiple organic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">substrates</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ]
        . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Biolog™</ENAMEX> also has been used to characterize oxidation
        capabilities of soil microbial communities [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] .
        Rodriquez, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] used the redox dye
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">cyano</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,3</NUMEX>-ditolyl <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tetrazolium chloride</ENAMEX> (CTC) for direct
        epifluorescent microscopic enumeration of respiring
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> in environmental samples. The oxidized form of CTC
        is nearly colorless and non-fluorescent. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oxidized CTC</ENAMEX> was
        observed to be reduced by biological electron transport
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX>, forming a fluorescent, insoluble CTC-formazan. The
        formazan accumulated intracellularly and could be
        visualized by epifluorescence microscopy in wet-mount
        preparations, on polycarbonate membrane filter surfaces, or
        directly in some biofilms. Thus, coupled with more limited
        analyses for specific electron transport molecules (e.g.,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">porphyrins</ENAMEX> or quinones), the use of respiratory dyes for
        detection of active electron transport in the biological
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">redox</ENAMEX> range could provide very convincing evidence for life
        in extraterrestrial locations. This approach would
        obviously only detect presently living <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX>, but these
        could include dormant life forms such as spores that might
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">germinate</ENAMEX> and grow using added nutrients.
      
      
        Results
        
          Examination of the presence of a chemical signature
          of life in various soils
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1presents</NUMEX> the results of a comparison of
          supercritical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon dioxide</ENAMEX> extractions of control (heat
          treated at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">600°C</NUMEX>) and life-positive (unheated <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Idaho</ENAMEX> red
          sand) soils. We confirmed the structures of the compounds
          shown as marked peaks by their respective <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">UV-VIS</ENAMEX> and mass
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">spectra</ENAMEX>. The supercritical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon dioxide</ENAMEX> (SCCO 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ) extracts of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Idaho</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">red sand</ENAMEX> (Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) and a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lake Boney Basin Antarctica</ENAMEX> soil, which
          contained relatively few <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>), showed
          detectable signature molecules in the extracted samples
          using either a diode array detector or an amperometric
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">detector</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). The sterile soil, after heat
          treatment, did not yield significant amounts of our
          targeted redox signature molecules: nicotinamide,
          riboflavin, Q 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FMN</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAD</ENAMEX>, and porphyrin (Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). To confirm that soil samples yielding negative
          results and those yielding signatures of redox moieties
          were different because of the presence and absence of
          biological <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">entities</ENAMEX>, we counted viable <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">extracted DNA</ENAMEX> from the heated control <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sand</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beacon</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valley Antarctic</ENAMEX> soil, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lake Boney Basin Antarctic</ENAMEX> soil,
          and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Idaho</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">red sand</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). There were small
          amounts of organic compounds in the extract of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beacon</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valley</ENAMEX> soil, but none matching our standards (no redox
          signature). At a detection limit of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 ng per gram</NUMEX> of
          soil, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> was absent from the control and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beacon</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valley</ENAMEX> soil, as were cultivable <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>. Soils that
          contained electron transport moieties (e.g., the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Idaho</ENAMEX>
          red <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sand</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lake Boney Basin</ENAMEX> soil) also contained both
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> and cultivable <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>.

          (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Idaho</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">red sand</ENAMEX>). Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4shows</TIMEX> results of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XTT</ENAMEX> reduction
          by the control soil and the life-positive <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Idaho</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">red sand</ENAMEX>.

          <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Beacon Valley</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Antarctica</ENAMEX> soil did not reduce either dye.
          As another control, Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6shows</NUMEX> the reduction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XTT</ENAMEX> by

        Discussion
        Energy use by living organisms directs our experimental
        design for seeking signs of extraterrestrial life. In
        terrestrial biological systems, energy is tapped via
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stepwise electron</ENAMEX> transport between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">electron donors</ENAMEX> and
        acceptors via an 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electron</ENAMEX> transport <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> . Applying
        this principle universally, we should be able to detect the
        chemical components of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electron</ENAMEX> transport <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX> or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electron</ENAMEX> transport itself as a signature of life.
        Our assumptions about the centrality of electron
        transport processes to life led us to a direct experimental
        approach for detection of life. We were able to measure
        actual electron transport in the redox range <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">between -1.0</NUMEX>
        and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">+1.0</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V</ENAMEX> in a microbe-poor soil, in the presence of air,
        and both with and without additions of an electron donor
        (dilute <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nutrient broth</ENAMEX>). The respiratory electron-accepting
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dyes DCIP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XTT</ENAMEX> were used to "short-circuit" microbial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electron</ENAMEX> transport, and this was observed (dye reduction)
        by visible spectroscopy. This method might entail some
        site-specific challenges in environments that are different
        from those on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX>, especially in developing appropriate
        controls for abiotic processes. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX> learned this lesson
        from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viking</ENAMEX> biology mission to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mars</ENAMEX>. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Viking</ENAMEX>'s
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gas</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">exchange</ENAMEX> experiment, water vapor exposed to the Martian
        soil released <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , but possibly only as a result of the
        activity of powerful soil <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxidants</ENAMEX> that also might have
        been responsible for the chemical reactivity seen in other
        Viking biology experiments [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] . A molecule such as DCIP
        or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XTT</ENAMEX> might be destroyed by oxidation in the presence of
        such soils. However, soil samples taken from borings
        beneath the surface, which is exposed to high energy,
        oxidant-generating ultraviolet radiation, or from other
        protected areas, might not be so destructive of organic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">compounds</ENAMEX>. Such stability problems should not be of such
        concern for extraterrestrial sites such as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europa</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Titan</ENAMEX>.
        Thus, our ability, confirmed here, to detect actual
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electron</ENAMEX> transport within the redox potential range of life
        processes, and to observe simultaneously some of the
        signature chemical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> involved, offers a promising
        direct approach to detecting the capability of living
        entities in soil on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX> or elsewhere in our solar system
        to move electrons between universal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX> and acceptors
        and obtain energy to support replication.
        Since we are not yet able to test this approach
        extraterrestrially, we validated our proposed detection
        method using pure microbial cultures and microbe-poor soils
        collected on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX>. A select group of signature chemicals
        were extracted from an organic-poor soil (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) and
        identified with instruments that eventually can be
        miniaturized for use on space exploration <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">missions</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 21</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> ] . Actual electron transport by living <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> was
        confirmed by use of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> specific dyes (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DCIP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XTT</ENAMEX>) that
        short-circuit respiratory electron transport <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chains</ENAMEX>. This
        was demonstrated using a pure strain of the common earthly
        soil <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">microorganism</ENAMEX>, 
        Pseudomonas putida (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>), and
        with native soil microorganisms within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two</TIMEX>
        nutrient-supplemented soil <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">matrixes</ENAMEX> (Figures <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3, 4, 5</ENAMEX>). We
        easily detected a signature of biological electron
        transport within a biologically poor, sandy soil containing
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 30,000</NUMEX> cultivable cells per <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">gram</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Idaho</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">red sand</ENAMEX>),
        and also from a soil from the extreme environment of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lake</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Boney Basin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Antarctica</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). Though the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Boney Basin</ENAMEX>
        soil readily reduced <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XTT</ENAMEX>, it only very slowly reduced DCIP
        (data not shown), and the rate of reduction was not
        significantly different between untreated soil and killed
        controls. Since <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DCIP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XTT</ENAMEX> have different redox
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">potentials</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XTT</ENAMEX> in our work appears to generally be
        more easily reduced by soil microbial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX>, this
        shows a need to use <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> respiratory dye in this
        type of experiment.
        Our observations also indicate that in soils from
        extreme environments, one may expect differences in their
        patterns of dye reduction that probably reflect differences
        in their <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">compositions</ENAMEX>. A soil from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Beacon Valley</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Antarctica</ENAMEX> that showed no <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> at our
        detection limit also showed no dye reduction activity with
        either dye. This soil appears to be sterile by our method
        of life detection; certainly it contains fewer microbial
        cells than our detection limit. Further investigations of
        this soil are thus warranted. For the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Idaho</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">red sand</ENAMEX>,
        assuming <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30,000</NUMEX> cells represent <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 1%</NUMEX> of actual biomass
        in the soil, the detection limit of our method should be
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 3,000,000</NUMEX> cells/g. Though the amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> observed
        in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lake Boney Basin</ENAMEX> soil was actually higher than seen
        in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Idaho</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">red sand</ENAMEX>, the microbial counts were lower
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). This shows once again the limitation of viable
        counts, which only count organisms that grow on the
        specific medium employed. It is well known that most
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> in nature cannot be cultured. Our work indicates
        there is probably a more dominant non-cultivable microbial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">community</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Antarctic</ENAMEX> soil compared to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Idaho</ENAMEX> soil,
        since <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> analysis indicated high numbers of microorganisms
        that were not reflected in viable count data.
        We need to improve the current detection limit for
        organic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">moieties</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>), estimated at <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3 × 10 6cells</NUMEX> per
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gram</ENAMEX> of soil. Processing larger quantities of soil could
        easily increase sensitivity for detection of redox
        molecules. Supplementing soils with appropriate electron
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX> and acceptors could stimulate extensive growth of
        low numbers of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">indigenous organisms</ENAMEX>. In theory, even a few
        cells/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">gram</NUMEX> of soil might be detected using this approach.
        The former procedure might be accomplished by using a
        "flow-through" soil <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">extractor</ENAMEX> that could receive multiple
        soil additions and concentrate the extracted <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> prior
        to downstream analysis. The latter procedure could be
        implemented by using a microtiter plate format similar that
        employed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biolog™</ENAMEX>, where <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</NUMEX> of potential electron
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX> could be examined simultaneously and the results
        (dye reduction) read by an on-board <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UV-visible</ENAMEX> spectral
        scanner designed for scanning microtiter plates. Examples
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donor</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acceptor</ENAMEX> combinations might include: simple sugars
        and/or amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> or other organic molecules in the
        presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> or nitrate (organisms capable of
        heterotrophic respiration), <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hydrogen</ENAMEX> and ferric ions or
        oxidized iron <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">minerals</ENAMEX> (chemoautotrophic hydrogen
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oxidizers</ENAMEX>), organic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> and ferric ions or oxidized iron
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">minerals</ENAMEX> (heterotrophic iron <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">reducers</ENAMEX>),
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">bicarbonate/carbonate</ENAMEX> and trace <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">minerals</ENAMEX> in the presence
        and absence of light (photosynthetic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>), carbon
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">dioxide</ENAMEX> and a reduced <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">metal</ENAMEX> such as ferrous ions
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">chemoautotrophs</NUMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ammonium ion</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">bicarbonate</ENAMEX>/carbonate
        (ammonia oxidizers), etc. The combinations could be adapted
        to the environment under study, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mars</ENAMEX> (perhaps an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">iron</ENAMEX>-dominated energy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX>).
        In this work, we emphasized that during validation on
        Earth of any life detection method there is a requirement
        for control measurements that corroborate earthly results
        of assays that might be carried out remotely on other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">planets</ENAMEX>. We chose measurements of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> (present in all
        earthly life) and readily cultivable <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> (present in
        most earthly soils) for validating our specific redox
        chemistry based approach. In the future, as we and others
        work to increase the sensitivity of this life detection
        approach toward values needed for the extreme environments
        on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX> and places such as the regolith of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mars</ENAMEX>, the
        simple controls we used should be supplemented by a number
        of others. These could include controls such as direct
        microscopic counts of active and inactive <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] ,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">extraction</ENAMEX> and quantitation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATP</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] , extraction and
        analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fatty acids</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] , real-time <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> of universal
        16S <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rDNA markers</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] , and/or use of a larger variety of
        culture media, including dilute organic media, in place of
        or in addition to plate count agar [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] . All of these
        approaches also have problems, such as the possible
        presence in soil of biological molecules that are not
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with living <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX>, the always-present inability
        of microbiologists to culture most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> present
        in soil, and the often unpredictable performance of PCR
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">primers</ENAMEX>. However, the sum of such multiple controls would
        build toward ultimate confidence in the sensitivity of this
        or any other life detection technique.
        Because there is great diversity among habitats for
        microbial life on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX>, and sterility of an earthly
        soil is rare, it would be desirable to examine as many as
        possible of these environments to determine the absolute
        reliability of our techniques for use extraterrestrially.
        Unfortunately, we cannot sample all possible terrestrial
        environments on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX>, or even a small fraction of them. We
        feel the diversity we have examined is sufficient to
        indicate the value of our approach, particularly since one
        of these extreme environments we did examine (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beacon</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valley</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Antarctica</ENAMEX>) appears to be sterile. We also cannot
        examine all known heterotrophic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> stored in culture
        collections to confirm that all or most of them effect dye
        reduction. However, the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many years</TIMEX> of experience using the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biolog™</ENAMEX> system, which employs respiratory dyes to indicate
        microbial metabolism [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18</NUMEX> ] , is strong support for our
        hypothesis that respiratory dye reduction is a robust and
        conclusive assay for heterotrophic life in soil. Further
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">validation</ENAMEX> efforts may show that observation of redox
        cycling of artificial electron acceptors of appropriate
        redox potentials may be sufficient in itself as a signature
        of life, greatly simplifying instrumentation requirements
        for extraterrestrial missions in our solar system and
        beyond.
      
      
        Conclusions
        Coupled with limited analyses for specific electron
        transport molecules (e.g., porphyrins and/or quinones), the
        use of respiratory dyes for detection of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electron</ENAMEX> transport
        in the biological redox range could provide very convincing
        evidence for life in extraterrestrial locations.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Signature chemicals
          As detailed in our prior work [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] , the following
          compounds were used as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> examples of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electron</ENAMEX> transport <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> components. Protoporphyrin <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">IX</NUMEX>,
          hemin, hematin, and nicotinamide (vitamin B 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> ) were purchased from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aldrich</ENAMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Milwaukee</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WI</ENAMEX>). Nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide (NAD),
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">riboflavin</ENAMEX> (vitamin B 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ), flavin mononucleotide (FMN),
          flavin adenine dinucleotide (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAD</ENAMEX>), and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DCIP</ENAMEX> were
          purchased from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">St. Louis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">MO</ENAMEX>).
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,3</NUMEX>-Dimethoxy-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methyl</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">,4</NUMEX>-benzoquinone (coenzyme Q 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> ) was purchased from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fluka</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buchs</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Switzerland</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XTT</ENAMEX> was purchased from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TCI America, Inc.</ENAMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Portland</ENAMEX>, OR). The other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemicals</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solvents</ENAMEX> used
          were of the highest available purity.
        
        
          Soils
          Natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sand</ENAMEX> from dune areas of southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Idaho</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Idaho</ENAMEX>
          red <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sand</ENAMEX>), poor in organic content and rich in oxidized
          iron <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">minerals</ENAMEX>, was used as a life-positive soil and
          surrogate for extraterrestrial soils. As a control we
          used cleaned, highly pure <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">silica sand</ENAMEX> purchased from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fisher Scientific</ENAMEX>. These soils are described in our
          previous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . Other extraterrestrial surrogate
          soils were collected from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beacon Valley</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lake</ENAMEX> Boney
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Basin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Antarctica</ENAMEX>. The soil from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beacon Valley</ENAMEX> was from
          an area where higher organisms such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nematodes</ENAMEX> have
          never been observed.
        
        
          Extraction of soil organic moieties
          Soil samples of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 to 15</NUMEX> g were used for supercritical
          fluid extraction (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SFE</ENAMEX>) with supercritical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CO</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (SCCO 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ). Samples were first hydrolyzed in
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 to 10</NUMEX> ml of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acetone</ENAMEX> containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M NH</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4 OH</ENAMEX> under ultrasound agitation (water
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bath</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">160 watts</NUMEX>) for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 h</TIMEX> at room temperature. Nitrogen
          blown over the sample then evaporated the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solvents</ENAMEX>. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SFE</ENAMEX> extraction was performed with the dry sample within
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX> to avoid any degradation of redox compounds. A
          piece of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Whatman</ENAMEX> glass <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber</ENAMEX> filter paper (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1.0 μm</NUMEX> pore
          size) was cut into a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.8</NUMEX> cm diameter circle and placed at
          the outlet end of a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>-ml <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SFE</ENAMEX> extraction cell to retain
          large particles. A hydrolyzed sample (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10 ml</NUMEX>) was then
          packed into the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessel</ENAMEX> until it was full. Exactly <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.0</NUMEX> ml
          of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">v/v</ENAMEX>) trimethylamine in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methanol</ENAMEX> as modifier was
          added to the sample, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessel</ENAMEX> was immediately
          connected to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SFE</ENAMEX> system. The extraction pressure was
          set at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> atm, the oven temperature at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35°C</TIMEX>, and the
          outlet valve temperature at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60°C</TIMEX>. After a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> min static
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">extraction</ENAMEX>, a dynamic extraction was started until
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ml of liquid <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CO</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> passed through the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SFE</ENAMEX> cell [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] .
          The flow rate was controlled at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 to 10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ml</ENAMEX>/min by the
          outlet valve. In order to achieve maximum recovery, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SFE</ENAMEX> procedure was repeated again under identical
          conditions.
        
        
          Chromatography
          Separations were performed using a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hewlett Packard</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HP-1090</ENAMEX> HPLC (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avondale</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PA</ENAMEX>). Samples of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 to 50</NUMEX> μL were
          injected onto a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Discovery Amide C16</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Discovery</ENAMEX> C18
          reverse phase column (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">15 cm × 4.6 mm</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 μm</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Supelco</ENAMEX>,
          Bellefonte, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PA</ENAMEX>), and analytes were separated using the
          ion-pair chromatographic method. Solvent A was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> mM
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tetrabutylammonium phosphate</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> mM KH 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 PO</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> , and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4%</NUMEX> acetonitrile (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V/V</ENAMEX>). Solvent
          B was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> acetonitrile. Runs were performed over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> min
          with gradient elution of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40%</NUMEX> B, then with static
          elution over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35 to 40</TIMEX> min with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60%</NUMEX> A<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">/40%</NUMEX> B, followed by
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40 to 42</TIMEX> min with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> A and a post-run wash of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">min</ENAMEX> at
          a flow rate of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.0</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ml</ENAMEX>/min [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] . Detectors used were a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tandem</ENAMEX> diode array detector (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAD</ENAMEX>) and dual carbon
          electrode amperometric detector (ECD).
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Electrospray</ENAMEX> tandem mass-spectrometry
          The identities of signature species present in
          extracts were confirmed by negative or positive
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">electrospray ionization</NUMEX> tandem mass spectrometry (Quattro
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">II</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Micromass Ltd.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">UK</ENAMEX>). Samples were delivered into the
          source at a flow rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5 μl/min</ENAMEX> using a syringe pump
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard Apparatus</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Natick</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MA</ENAMEX>) or directly from a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPLC</ENAMEX> column, with effluent from the column split <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">100</ENAMEX>. A
          potential of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5 to 3</NUMEX> kV was applied to the electrospray
          needle. The sample cone was kept at an average of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">V.</ENAMEX>
          The counter electrode, skimmer, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RF</ENAMEX> (radio frequency)
          lens potentials were tuned to maximize the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ion beam</ENAMEX> for a
          given solvent. The resolution of the detector was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15,000</NUMEX>,
          and the source temperature was kept constant at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">80°C</TIMEX>. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">instrument</ENAMEX> was calibrated using a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">polyethylene</ENAMEX> glycol
          solution. All spectra were an average of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 to 15</NUMEX>
          scans.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Biomass</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> analysis in soil
          The numbers of cultivable soil <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">microorganisms</ENAMEX> were
          estimated by standard plate count and serial dilution
          methods. Standard plate count medium (PCM) was used to
          culture <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> from soil <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> was
          extracted from different soils using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FastPrep</ENAMEX> DNA
          spin kit from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qbiogene, Inc.</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Carlsbad</ENAMEX>, CA). The
          concentration of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> was estimated by measuring
          fluorescence at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">520</NUMEX> nm. Fluorescence was measured after
          staining the sample with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pico Green</ENAMEX> fluorescent dye
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Molecular Probes</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eugene</ENAMEX>, OR). Our detection limit was
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 1</NUMEX> ng of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 g</TIMEX> of soil.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DCIP</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XTT</ENAMEX> reduction assays
          Working in a sterile laminar flow hood, we added <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.0</NUMEX> g
          of soil, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16.0</NUMEX> mL of sterile <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> mM phosphate buffer (pH
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">7.5</NUMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> mL of 100X <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nutrient Broth</ENAMEX> as a biological
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reductant</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Difco</ENAMEX>), and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.0</NUMEX> mL of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> mM <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DCIP</ENAMEX> to a sterile
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> mL serum bottle. Bottles were plugged and capped with
          sterile closures and shaken at room temperature for
          required experimental time. Periodically, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.0</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mL</ENAMEX>) were removed aseptically and centrifuged to remove
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">solids</ENAMEX>. The absorbance of the filtrate was measured at
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">600 nm.</TIMEX> Concentrations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DCIP</ENAMEX> (oxidized) were calculated
          using a molar extinction coefficient of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ε</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21.0</NUMEX> × <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> 3M
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">-1cm -1.</ENAMEX> Reoxidation of DCIPH 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> was negligible under our
          experimental conditions. Samples were run in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">triplicate</ENAMEX>.
          Reduction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">XTT</ENAMEX> was monitored similarly as described
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DCIP</ENAMEX>, except we measured the increase in absorbance
          at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">465</NUMEX> nm resulting from reduction of the colorless
          oxidized dye to an orange <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">product</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] .
