        Pelvic floor disorders (PFD) are highly prevalent among
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elderly women</ENAMEX>. Many surgical reports attempt to determine
        the best surgical treatment for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PFD</ENAMEX>, yet do not address the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathophysiology</ENAMEX>. The etiology of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PFD</ENAMEX> is probably
        multifactorial, including a genetic predisposition to
        connective tissue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">abnormalities</ENAMEX>, vaginal childbirth with
        damage to the innervation of the pelvic floor muscles,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">estrogen deficiency</ENAMEX>, and aging effects [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . The pelvic
        floor, situated at the bottom of the abdominal cavity,
        forms a supporting shelf for the abdominal and pelvic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">viscera</ENAMEX>. It has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> layers: the endopelvic fascia, the
        levator fasciae and muscles, and the perineal
        membrane/external anal sphincter.
        The primary support for the pelvic organs comes from the
        pelvic floor muscles [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] . This suggests that an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alteration</ENAMEX> to the levator ani supportive function may
        significantly contribute to the pathogenesis of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PFD</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] ,
        which affect <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> of younger and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">nearly 50%</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elderly</ENAMEX> women
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . In <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>, the levator muscles form a horizontal
        shelf with an <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">anterior midline cleft</ENAMEX> (the urogenital
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hiatus</ENAMEX>) through which the urethra, vagina, and rectum pass.
        Anatomically, the levator muscle is subdivided into the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">iliococcygeal</ENAMEX> and the pubococcygeal muscles [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5</NUMEX> ] (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
        The levator ani muscles play an important role in
        bladder neck fixation provided by the suspensory sling and
        hiatal ligament [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . The urethra is supported by the
        action of the levator ani muscles through their connection
        to the endopelvic fascia of the anterior vaginal wall [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ]
        , and the muscles of the levator ani contract during a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cough</ENAMEX> to assist continence [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . The fast twitch type II
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> in the levator ani muscles play an important role in
        continence, and their loss accompanies the development of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">urinary incontinence</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinically</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> with
        recurrent urinary incontinence after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Burch</ENAMEX> colposuspension
        have a more pronounced pelvic floor weakness than women
        with primary stress urinary incontinence [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . This
        suggests that the recurrent <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">urinary incontinence</ENAMEX> is caused
        by a progression of pelvic floor dysfunction. Severe
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alteration</ENAMEX> in the levator ani integrity is associated also
        with fecal incontinence [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12 13</NUMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Histologic</ENAMEX> and histochemical analysis of pubococcygeal
        muscle obtained from asymptomatic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> and from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PFD</ENAMEX> has shown that both age and parity (vaginal delivery)
        appeared to be related to the morphological features of the
        samples. In the symptomatic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> there was a significant
        increase in the number of muscle fibers showing
        pathological damage. The range of diameters of both type I
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> was significantly different between
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">symptomatic</ENAMEX> and asymptomatic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. A significant
        proportion (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90-100%</NUMEX>) of muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> in symptomatic women
        were type I fibers, showed centrally located nuclei, and
        exhibited significantly greater diameter than type I fibers
        in asymptomatic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] .
        However, the cellular and molecular aspects of
        regression of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">type II</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> are poorly understood. Though
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apoptosis</ENAMEX> in adult muscles has been described, and may
        result from changes within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">bcl2</TIMEX>/bax system, alteration in
        pathways that regulate differentiation of muscle cells,
        changes in the myonuclei, and the nature of pathways
        inducing senescence of skeletal muscles are still far from
        being clear [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] .
        Among cell cycle related <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, an important role in
        the regulation of skeletal muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">differentiation</ENAMEX> belongs
        to p27 kip1(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">p27</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] , a cyclin-dependent kinase
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inhibitor</ENAMEX> required for cell cycle arrest. Additionally,
        since the identification and cloning of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">p27</NUMEX> gene in
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] , the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p27 protein</ENAMEX> has been shown to be involved
        in various other aspects of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell physiology</ENAMEX> and pathology [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> ] . Our previous study has shown, that differentiation
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> in tissue culture is associated with an increase
        in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p27</TIMEX> expression [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . Although a regular p27
        expression protects normal cells from apoptosis,
        overexpression of p27 induces apoptosis of cells, through
        elevation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proapoptotic proteins</ENAMEX>, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Bax</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 20</NUMEX> ] .
        These observations indicate that changes in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p27</TIMEX> expression
        can determine the fate of muscle cells.
        Aims of the present study were to investigate p27
        expression in levator ani muscle of symptomatic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>,
        determine changes with age, and compare the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">p27</NUMEX> expression
        with histochemical detection of fast- and slow twitch
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">muscle fibers</ENAMEX> in parallel sections.
      
      
        Materials and Methods
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX>
          Biopsy samples <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 Ã— 5 Ã— 5 mm</NUMEX> were collected from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX>
          symptomatic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PFD</ENAMEX> (stress urinary
          incontinence, pelvic organ prolapse, fecal incontinence,
          and overlaps; age range <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38-74</NUMEX>) without hormone
          replacement therapy. Besides <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormone</ENAMEX> replacement, also
          excluded from the study were <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with a history of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">malignancy</ENAMEX>, endometriosis, and pelvic infections.
          Tissue sampling from levator ani muscles and fascia,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">illustrated</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, was based on the work of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bernstein</ENAMEX>
          [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] (biopsy size and site), with some modifications
          approved by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institutional Review Board</ENAMEX>. We used
          similar approaches to obtain the biopsy during
          reconstructive surgery (symptomatic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>) and
          abdominal hysterectomy (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">asymptomatic</ENAMEX> controls). The
          biopsy sample was always obtained from the right
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pubococcygeal</ENAMEX> muscle. The biopsy was lateral (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20-25</NUMEX> mm)
          to the urethrovesical junction and was performed midway
          between the urethra and arcus tendinus (white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">line</ENAMEX>). It
          was lateral enough from the urethra to avoid any
          alteration of nerves to the urethra and bladder.
          In reconstructive surgery, on entering the space of
          Retzius, the fat was pushed aside to expose the superior
          fascia of the levator ani. After incision, the fascia
          biopsy specimen (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5 Ã— 5 mm</NUMEX>) was collected. Next, the Allis
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clamp</ENAMEX> was used to expose a small part of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pubococcygeal</ENAMEX> muscle and collect a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 Ã— 5 Ã— 5 mm</NUMEX> muscle
          biopsy specimen.
          For comparison, biopsies were obtained from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX>
          asymptomatic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 31-49</TIMEX>) who were having a
          hysterectomy for benign conditions such as abnormal
          uterine bleeding, fibroids or pelvic pain, and no hormone
          replacement therapy. They did not have any demonstrable
          pelvic relaxation by examination or history of stress
          urinary incontinence. We were unable, during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a two year</TIMEX>
          period, collect biopsies from asymptomatic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> of age
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50 or older</TIMEX>. The apparent reason for this is that, except
          for urogynecological indications and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>, there is
          virtually no reason for abdominal gynecologic surgery in
          postmenopausal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>. To ensure the compatibility of
          biopsy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX>, the space of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Retzius</ENAMEX> was opened in all
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
          During abdominal hysterectomy, the urinary bladder was
          pushed down to reach the space of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Retzius</ENAMEX> by incision
          right behind the pubic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fat</ENAMEX> was pushed aside
          with the assistance of a hand in the vagina, and biopsy
          was performed as described. After biopsy, a single
          figure-of-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> stitch suture was placed in all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>,
          which corrected any potential loss of support that might
          be caused by the biopsy. This was bloodless and did not
          create any lasting difficulties. None of the control
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> developed urinary incontinence or evidence of
          loss of support or voiding difficulties.
          In younger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">asymptomatic women</ENAMEX>, we also collected
          biopsy samples of ectocervix and endometrium from
          hysterectomy specimens. These <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> were utilized to
          determine p27 expression in other tissues, for comparison
          with expression in the skeletal muscle (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>). In
          addition, we utilized our collection of frozen human
          corpora lutea (CL), from which some observations have
          been reported previously [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 22 23</NUMEX> ] , in order to
          determine a relationship of p27 expression with some
          other cell cycle related <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> under specific
          circumstances (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>). All parts of the study were
          approved by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institutional Review Board</ENAMEX> at our
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Tennessee Graduate School of Medicine</ENAMEX>. All
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> underwent the informed consent process and signed
          informed consent forms before participation.

          liquid nitrogen and stored at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">-80Â°C until</TIMEX> use. Frozen
          tissues were sliced into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> Î¼m serial sections using a
          cryostat microtome with specimen retraction during return
          travel (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carl Zeiss Microm</ENAMEX> HM <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">505</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E; MICROM LaborgerÃ</ENAMEX>¤te
          GmbH, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Waldorf</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>). The slides were dried overnight
          at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> temperature and stored at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4Â°C</TIMEX>. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunohistochemical</ENAMEX> and histochemical procedures were
          performed within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks</TIMEX>. If required, additional
          sections were obtained from frozen blocks.
          The labeled streptavidin-biotin method was employed
          for peroxidase immunohistochemistry. All steps were
          performed at room temperature. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Universal DAKO LSAB</ENAMEX> Â®2
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peroxidase Kit</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAKO Corporation</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Carpinteria</ENAMEX>, CA) was
          used according to the instructions provided by vendor
          with some modifications. Briefly, cryostat <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX> were
          fixed with acetone, dried for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30 minutes</TIMEX>, and rinsed in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphate</ENAMEX> buffered saline (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phosphate</ENAMEX> buffered

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>, and link solution (biotinated anti-mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX>)
          was applied for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">15 minutes</TIMEX>. Subsequently, washed slides
          were incubated with streptavidin-peroxidase conjugate for

          The immunohistochemical staining was quantified as an
          area in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">square micrometers</ENAMEX> (maximum area for whole screen
          was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">307,200 sq</NUMEX> micrometers at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100Ã—</NUMEX> magnification)
          occupied by the densities of peroxidase staining above
          the sample background, as described previously [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 26</NUMEX> ]
          . Briefly, the illumination of empty <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">field</ENAMEX> (image
          background) was first adjusted to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0 to 255</TIMEX> scale.
          Measurement of an area of peroxidase staining was
          performed using the density slice method. The upper limit
          of the density slice was set at the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">255</NUMEX> (maximum density
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">value</ENAMEX>) and the lower limit at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">150</NUMEX>, sufficiently high
          above the hematoxylin staining of the nuclei, which does
          not exceed a density value <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">120</NUMEX>. Under these conditions,
          the measured area represented a crude value in square
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">micrometers</ENAMEX> (e.g., <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50,000</NUMEX>). To obtain net values, each
          crude value was subtracted with the value of tissue
          background obtained from the same sample stained with a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> staining (e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">500 Î¼m 2</ENAMEX>, net value = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">49,500</NUMEX> Î¼m
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Six</NUMEX> measurements were performed on each biopsy
          sample. These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> values represented a dataset for a
          single biopsy (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>) stained for a particular marker.

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX>).
          To evaluate the density of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p27</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">staining</ENAMEX> in western
          blots, we used a different approach. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scanned blot</ENAMEX> was
          transferred into the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scion Image</ENAMEX>, enlarged 4Ã— (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> times
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2Ã—</NUMEX>) and each <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lane</ENAMEX> was processed as follows. Small square
          area (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">20 Ã— 20 pixels</NUMEX>) was used to obtain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> background
          measurements above the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">p27</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX>. Subsequently, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>
          measurements of staining within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the p27</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">band</ENAMEX> (crude
          values) were obtained. Each crude value was subtracted
          with corresponding background value, giving the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> net
          values of p27 density. The net values were used for
          statistical calculations.

        Results and Discussion
        
          Western blot analysis
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2Ashows that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p27</TIMEX>, clone <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">G173-524</ENAMEX>,
          produces a single <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">band</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> kDa in all investigated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tissues</ENAMEX>, and no nonspecific staining is apparent with
          secondary antibody alone. This indicates that all
          immunohistochemical observations should be ascribed to
          the specific expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p27 protein</ENAMEX>. In western <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">blot</ENAMEX>,
          the most prominent p27 expression was in the late
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">trophoblast</ENAMEX> culture (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">120 h</ENAMEX>), as expected from our
          previous study [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . When compared to trophoblast
          culture, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the p27</TIMEX> expression in levator ani muscles was
          lower, but higher then weak expression in whole placenta
          and rectus fascia.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2Bshows quantitative evaluation (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">materials</ENAMEX> and
          methods) of the blot in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> A. The statistical
          evaluation showed no significant difference between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          cases included (symptomatic and asymptomatic female) in
          density of p27 expression in levator ani muscles.
        
        
          Immunohistochemistry
          Expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p27</ENAMEX> in levator ani muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> asymptomatic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> was restricted to the plasma
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">membrane</ENAMEX> and adjacent nuclei (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3A, and inset). Some
          muscle fibers close to the levator fascia often showed
          weak cytoplasmic staining but no change in the cell size
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3B). Pre- and perimenopausal symptomatic patients
          showed hypertrophy of muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX>, and this was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with variable cytoplasmic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p27</ENAMEX> expression,
          ranging from none to moderate (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3C). Biopsy samples
          obtained from symptomatic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> in advanced postmenopause
          showed diminution of size in some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> accompanied by
          strong cytoplasmic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p27</ENAMEX> expression (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3D, and inset).
          This was accompanied by appearance of cytoplasmic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vacuoles</ENAMEX> in regressing muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3E, and inset)
          and by an increase in the stromal component (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">s. Fig</ENAMEX>.
          3Eand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">3F</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Control</ENAMEX> procedure showed no non-specific
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">staining</ENAMEX> (inset. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3F).
          These data indicate that hypertrophy of muscle fibers
          may be accompanied by <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">moderate p27</NUMEX> cytoplasmic
          expression. Further increase in cytoplasmic staining (p27
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">overexpression</ENAMEX>) accompanies shrinking and fragmentation
          of muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX>. This was characteristic for symptomatic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> in advanced postmenopause, suggesting that hormonal
          changes accompanying postmenopause, such as diminution of
          ovarian sex <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroid</ENAMEX> production, might contribute to the
          degenerative changes in the levator ani muscle.
          From the ovarian sex <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroids</ENAMEX>, the role of diminishing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">estrogen</ENAMEX> levels is questionable, since the levator ani
          muscle fibers do not express <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">estrogen</ENAMEX> receptor alpha [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX> ] . It is not known if <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">estrogen</ENAMEX> receptor beta is
          expressed, but levator ani muscle fibers show nuclear

          . Altered ovarian function in the premenopause can be
          observed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">as early as age 43 years</TIMEX>, and includes
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hyperestrogenism</ENAMEX> and hypergonadotropism, accompanied by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">decreased progesterone secretion</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . During the
          transition from pre- to postmenopause both estrogen and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">androgen</ENAMEX> levels also decline [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] . These hormonal
          alterations may well be responsible for the increased
          gynecological <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">morbidity</ENAMEX> that characterizes this period of
          life, including structural and molecular changes in
          levator ani muscle and increasing incidence of pelvic
          floor disorders.
        
        
          Diminution of fast twitch fibers
          We also studied histochemical staining (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">type II</ENAMEX> and
          type I fibers) along with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> p27 expression. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4,</ENAMEX>
          A,B,C, is a biopsy from an asymptomatic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 38</TIMEX>)
          exhibiting a proportional number of fast- (f; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4A)
          and slow twitch <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> (s; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4B), and strong surface
          and nuclear but no cytoplasmic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p27</ENAMEX> expression (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          4C).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5is from a symptomatic female (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 50</TIMEX>). Some
          muscle fibers exhibited both type I and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">type II staining</ENAMEX>,
          representing the "transitory" (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">t1 and t2</TIMEX>) types. This was
          accompanied by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p27</TIMEX> cytoplasmic expression in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">t2 fibers</ENAMEX>.
          In addition, some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> showed type I staining
          accompanied by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p27</TIMEX> cytoplasmic expression (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">t3 fibers</ENAMEX>).
          This contrasted with a quiescent (genuine) fast- (f) and
          slow twitch (s) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX>, which showed either type I or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">type II staining</ENAMEX> and no <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">p27</NUMEX> cytoplasmic expression. The
          "transitory" <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> often exhibited hypertrophy.
          Occurrence of both <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">type II</ENAMEX> and type I staining in the
          same striated muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber</ENAMEX> has not been described. When
          using the term "transitory" <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX>, we are aware that a
          static picture can not explain the dynamic process.
          However, the "transitory" fibers show both <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">type II</ENAMEX> and
          type I staining, cytoplasmic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p27</ENAMEX> expression suggestive of
          ongoing differentiation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18</NUMEX> ] , and marked
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypertrophy</ENAMEX>. The occurrence of "transitory" <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> was
          also associated with a decline in the number of fibers
          exhibiting the type <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> staining only, which suggests a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">type II</ENAMEX> into type I transition. Also, a lack of muscle
          cell shrinking and fragmentation during this process
          indicates that <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">type II</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> do not degenerate but are
          transformed into the type I fibers.

          postmenopausal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 63</TIMEX>). Type I staining was
          characteristic for all <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> present, including those
          exhibiting a diminution in size (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 6B). Staining for
          p27 revealed appearance of weak (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a1</NUMEX>) to moderate
          cytoplasmic expression (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">a2</NUMEX>) in some otherwise normal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX>. Very strong p27 expression was characteristic for
          the fibers exhibiting cytoplasmic vacuolization (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">a3</ENAMEX>, see
          also inset, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3E) and fragmentation (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">a4</ENAMEX>, arrow), i.e.,
          morphologic features characteristic for the cells
          undergoing apoptotic cell death [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] .

          levator ani muscle from asymptomatic and symptomatic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. The mean p27 expression in symptomatic patients
          (age range <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38-73 years</TIMEX>) was much higher ( 
          P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.0001</NUMEX>) when compared to
          controls (age range <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31-49 years</TIMEX>). The power for number of
          cases was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX>, for number of measurements <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99%</NUMEX>. However,
          there was also a highly significant difference in mean
          age between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 7B; P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.0001</NUMEX>, power
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99%</NUMEX>). At present, we are not able to determine if in
          asymptomatic postmenopausal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">p27</NUMEX> expression in
          levator ani muscles also increases with age, since
          non-urogynecological surgery, except <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> (excluded),
          is exceptional in such cases.
        
        
          p27 cytoplasmic expression and muscle
          abnormality
          An important question is whether the increase in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytoplasmic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p27</ENAMEX> expression correlates with the age of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and the severity of the muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">abnormality</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          8shows a lack of cytoplasmic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p27</ENAMEX> staining of levator ani
          muscle in another control female (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 42</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> A)
          exhibiting normal size of muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX>) and high
          proportion of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">type II</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> B). Panels C and D
          show a situation in the youngest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> from symptomatic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 38</TIMEX>; pelvic organ prolapse). The muscle fibers
          show marked hypertrophy (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">h</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cytoplasmic</ENAMEX> p27
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">expression</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> C) associated with a lack of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">type II</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">staining</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> D). On the other hand, panels E and F
          show a situation in the oldest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">female</ENAMEX> in asymptomatic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX>. The size of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> is normal, but moderate p27
          cytoplasmic staining is evident (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> E). This is,
          however, accompanied by a lack of fast twitch fibers
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> F).
          Hence, even in the presence of moderate cytoplasmic
          p27 expression in muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> of normal size (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 8E),
          which accompanies depletion of fast twitch <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> (panel
          F), the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> may remain continent, without an actual
          evidence of pelvic floor disorder. On the other hand,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytoplasmic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p27</ENAMEX> expression accompanying hypertrophy of
          muscle cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> C) was accompanied by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PFD</ENAMEX>. These
          observations indicate that an increase in cytoplasmic p27
          staining may accompany normal female aging (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 49</TIMEX>),

          along with the diminution of fast twitch <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> in
          otherwise normal muscles, and without manifestation of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PFD</ENAMEX>. Conversely, levator ani from younger symptomatic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">patient</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 38</TIMEX>) exhibited hypertrophy of muscle cells,
          accompanied by increased cytoplasmic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p27</ENAMEX> expression and
          manifestation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PFD</ENAMEX>. Altogether, the cytoplasmic p27
          expression is indicative of fast to slow twitch
          transition of levator ani myotubes, but not necessarily
          indicative of manifestation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PFD</ENAMEX>, assuming normal
          muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">morphology</ENAMEX>.
          Table 1summarizes our observations, and suggests
          possible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pathways</ENAMEX> for the transition of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">type II</ENAMEX> to type I
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> and progression of degeneration of levator ani
          muscle cells. Note that a lack of type I staining is
          characteristic for fast twitch <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> only (row <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>), and a
          lack of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p27</ENAMEX> cytoplasmic expression is characteristic for
          the "resting" fast- and slow twitch <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> in
          "early transition" (rows <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 and 5</NUMEX>). Only <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> in row
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3</TIMEX> show type <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">II</ENAMEX>, type I and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p27</ENAMEX> cytoplasmic staining, and
          a lack of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">type II staining</ENAMEX> is apparent from row <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> on.
          During transition, the fast twitch <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> may increase in
          size, and gradually change into the slow twitch fibers
          exhibiting regular size. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Fibers</ENAMEX> in "advanced transition"
          (rows <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 and 4</NUMEX>), and those undergoing degeneration (rows 6
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>), are associated with cytoplasmic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p27</ENAMEX> expression.
          Although rows <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 and 6</NUMEX> are similar, the latter is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with the regression of many accompanying
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">myotubes</ENAMEX> (see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-F, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>).
        
        
          How unique is the unusual p27 expression for the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">skeletal</ENAMEX> muscle?
          p27 is a cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) inhibitor, and
          is normally expected to be localized to the cell nucleus.
          In normal cells, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p27</ENAMEX> is sequestered and its activity
          gradually decreases as cells reach S phase, p27
          preferentially binds cyclin <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">cdk4</NUMEX>, but lower levels of
          cdk4 (in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-Î² treated cells) allow <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p27</ENAMEX> to be available
          for binding to the cyclin <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E-cdk2</ENAMEX> and cyclin <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">A-cdk2</ENAMEX>. p27
          is structurally related to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the p21</TIMEX>, having a similar
          sequence in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal region. Inhibition of cell
          cycle by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p27 and p21</TIMEX> is complemented by retinoblastoma
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein pRb</ENAMEX>, and other cell cycle <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inhibitors</ENAMEX> (tumor
          suppressor <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30 31 32</NUMEX> ] . In reality, besides
          their role in the regulation of the cell cycle, the cdk
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inhibitors</ENAMEX>, in association with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-type cyclins, cyclin E,
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">cdk2</ENAMEX>, play a direct role in the stimulation of
          epithelial <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> differentiation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] . p27 is also
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transiently</ENAMEX> expressed in developing myotomes and enhances
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">myogenesis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] .
          The localization of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">p27</NUMEX> to plasma membrane and the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cytoplasm</ENAMEX> in normal and abnormal striated muscle 
          in vivo raises a question how
          unique these unusual expressions are for the skeletal
          muscle cells. The observations, summarized in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>,
          indicate that cytoplasmic expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p27</ENAMEX> is related to
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> dynamic processes, (i) advanced "transition" of fast
          to slow twitch <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> (rows <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 and 4</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>), and (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ii</ENAMEX>)
          gradual degeneration of muscle cells (rows <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 and 7</NUMEX>). On
          the other hand, regardless of the status (quiescent fast
          and slow twitch <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX>, myotubes in transition or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">degenerating</ENAMEX>) the muscle cells exhibit plasma membrane
          p27 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staining</ENAMEX>.
          Excellent models for the studies of cell
          differentiation 
          in vivo are stratified squamous
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epithelia</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] , particularly those that are easily to
          collect, such as the samples of epithelium of ectocervix
          from hysterectomy specimens. In addition, the epithelium
          of ectocervix is hormonally dependent, and shows certain
          changes along with the fluctuations of levels of ovarian
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroids</ENAMEX> during the menstrual cycle. Another, even more
          hormonally dependent tissue is endometrium. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 9shows
          p27 expression in the ectocervix and corresponding
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">endometrium</ENAMEX> (from the same uteri).
          In ectocervix, during the early follicular phase, when
          increasing levels of estrogens stimulate proliferation of
          stem cells and subsequent shift of cells between the
          layers - toward surface, some mature epithelial cells
          (upper intermediate layers) showed cytoplasmic p27
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">staining</ENAMEX> (white arrowhead, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 9A). p27 expression was
          also apparent in the surface (degenerating) cells (black
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arrowhead</ENAMEX>) but not between these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> layers (dotted
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arrowhead</ENAMEX>). This resembles the transition of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">type II</ENAMEX> into
          type I fibers, and degeneration of myotubes. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">follicular</ENAMEX> phase, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p27</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">staining</ENAMEX> was restricted to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nuclei</ENAMEX> (white arrow, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> B), but during the luteal
          phase, when the influence of estrogens is accompanied by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">progesterone</ENAMEX>, the nuclear p27 diminished (black arrow,
          panel C), and mature and aged epithelial cells showed
          surface p27 expression, similar to that in all types of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">muscle fibers</ENAMEX>.
          In endometrium, the early follicular phase was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with strong stromal <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p27</ENAMEX> expression (s, panel
          D), accompanied by variable nuclear expression in
          epithelium of narrow glands (arrows). In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">follicular</ENAMEX> phase, stromal and nuclear <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">p27</NUMEX> staining
          increased further (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> E), but luteal phase endometrium
          showed diminution of both (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> F). Altogether, these
          observations indicate that, in addition to the striated
          muscle cells, the cytoplasmic and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">plasma membrane</ENAMEX> p27
          expression can be observed (under certain circumstances)
          in other cell types. Yet, the cytoplasmic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p27</ENAMEX> expression
          in abnormal skeletal muscles also appears to be
          temporary, i.e., during the transition (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">type II</ENAMEX> to type
          I) and terminal regression of myotubes.
          Moreover, a combined action of estrogens and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">progesterone</ENAMEX>, characteristic for the luteal phase,
          appears to cause a diminution of nuclear p27 expression
          in the epithelium of ectocervix and endometrium (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">9,</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cand</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">9F</ENAMEX>). Curiously, the remnants of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p27</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">staining</ENAMEX> were
          confined to the nuclear envelope (arrows, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>, Cand
          9F; see also <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 10A), suggesting a degradation of p27
          in the nuclear core, and/or a defect of p27
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">synthesis/</ENAMEX>transport. These tissues, however, do posses
          nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> for both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroids</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36 37</NUMEX> ] .
          We did not detect similar fluctuation of nuclear p27
          expression in muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX>, yet myotubes do not exhibit
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">estrogen</ENAMEX> receptor expression [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2 26</ENAMEX> ] . However,
          estrogen, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">progesterone</ENAMEX> and androgen <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> are
          expressed in the principal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> (fibroblasts) of levator
          ani fascia [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] , which represents another important
          component of the pelvic floor involved in its suspensory
          function, and might be a target of the complex effect of
          hormonal fluctuations during the cycle, and influenced by
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormone</ENAMEX> replacement therapy in postmenopausal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX>.
          Some recent studies indicate that long-term continuous
          estrogen <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">replacement</ENAMEX> is not beneficial, yet may worsen or
          induce the manifestation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PFD</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38 39</NUMEX> ] , possibly
          through the suppression of sex <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">steroid</ENAMEX> receptor
          expression in the pelvic floor. Since <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">progesterone</ENAMEX> and
          androgen <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> are also expressed in the levator ani
          muscle, and long-term estrogen replacement therapy
          appears to suppress their expression [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] , both the
          levator ani fascia and muscle might be affected by
          continuous estrogen replacement.
        
        
          Correlation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cytoplasmic p27</ENAMEX> with other cell
          cycle proteins
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cytoplasmic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p27</ENAMEX> expression in the skeletal muscle and
          epithelium of ectocervix raises the question if it is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with some other cell cycle <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, which
          otherwise show characteristic nuclear localization. We
          investigated ovarian <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CL</ENAMEX>, another interesting structure
          for the studies of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell differentiation</ENAMEX> and degeneration 
          in vivo [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 22 23</NUMEX> ] , and found
          that cytoplasmic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p27</ENAMEX> expression is constantly present in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CL</ENAMEX> of pregnancy.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> A, shows that the mature <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CL</ENAMEX> of the
          menstrual cycle has p27 expression limited to the luteal
          vessels; luteal cells show only traces of nuclear p27
          (arrow) and no cytoplasmic staining. However, in the CL
          of pregnancy, nuclei of luteal cells show abundant p27
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">expression</ENAMEX> (arrow, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> B), accompanied by moderate
          cytoplasmic staining. Nuclear p27 is also evident in
          stromal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> (s, arrowhead). When compared to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p27</TIMEX>, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cyclin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">D1</ENAMEX> is expressed in some nuclei of luteal cells
          only (arrow, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> C) and absent from the stromal cells
          in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CL</ENAMEX> of pregnancy. However, the cytoplasmic
          expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cyclin D1</ENAMEX> is similar to that of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p27</TIMEX>.
          Staining for cyclin E (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> D) shows expression in
          occasional nuclei. The insert shows a lack of Ki67
          +dividing cells. Expression of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p21</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> E) is similar
          to that of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cyclin E.</ENAMEX> The pRb (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> F) shows nuclear
          expression similar to that of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p27</TIMEX>, including stromal
          cells, but no cytoplasmic staining of luteal cells.
          These observations indicate that cytoplasmic
          expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p27</ENAMEX> correlates with that of cyclin <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D1</TIMEX>. One
          may speculate that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">cdk4</ENAMEX> is involved, since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">p27</TIMEX> has a
          preferential affinity to the cyclin <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">cdk4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX>. If
          the cytoplasmic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p27</ENAMEX> expression in abnormal muscle cells
          is accompanied by staining for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">cyclin D1</TIMEX>, remains,
          however, to be established.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        This is a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> report on the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">p27 protein</ENAMEX> expression in
        normal and abnormal human striated muscle cells 
        in vivo. Normal muscle fibers show
        strong nuclear and plasma membrane expression. Cytoplasmic
        p27 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staining</ENAMEX> accompanies perimenopausal transition of type
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> to type I fibers. In the absence of other muscle
        abnormalities, the diminution of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">type II</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> alone is
        not necessarily accompanied by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PFD</ENAMEX>. Pelvic floor disorders
        in perimenopausal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> are associated with the
        hypertrophy of muscle cells and moderate cytoplasmic p27
        expression, while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PFD</ENAMEX> during advanced postmenopause are
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with shrinking and fragmentation of muscle cells
        and cytoplasmic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">p27</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">overexpression</ENAMEX>. The cytoplasmic and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">plasma membrane p27</ENAMEX> expression is not unique to the muscle
        cells, since it can also be detected to occur, at least
        temporarily, in other cell types.
