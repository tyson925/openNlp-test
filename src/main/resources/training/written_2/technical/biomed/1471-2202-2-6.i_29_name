        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Taste receptor cells</ENAMEX> are specialized epithelial cells,
        which are organized into discrete endorgans called taste
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">buds</ENAMEX>. Typical taste <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">buds</ENAMEX> contain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>-100 polarized taste
        cells, which extend from the basal lamina to the taste
        pore, where apical microvilli protrude into the oral
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cavity</ENAMEX>. The basolateral membrane forms chemical synapses
        with primary gustatory neurons (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1A). In mammals,
        lingual taste <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">buds</ENAMEX> are housed in connective tissue
        structures called papillae. Fungiform papillae are located
        on the anterior <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two-thirds</NUMEX> of the tongue and typically
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">contain 1-2</ENAMEX> taste <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">buds</ENAMEX> each. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vallate</ENAMEX> and foliate papillae
        are found on the posterior tongue and house <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several hundred</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">taste buds</ENAMEX> each. Taste transduction begins when sapid
        stimuli interact with the apical membrane of taste cells,
        usually resulting in taste cell depolarization, calcium
        influx, and transmitter release onto gustatory afferent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neurons</ENAMEX>. Simple stimuli, such as salts and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> depolarize
        taste cells by direct interaction with apical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">ion channels</ENAMEX>.
        In contrast, complex stimuli, such as sugars, amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>,
        and most bitter compounds bind to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> protein coupled
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">receptors</ENAMEX>, initiating intracellular signaling cascades that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">culminate</ENAMEX> in Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+influx or release of Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intracellular</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3</NUMEX> ] .
        Inositol <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,4,5</NUMEX>-trisphosphate (IP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> ) is an important <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">messenger</ENAMEX> in
        both bitter and sweet taste transduction. In both pathways,
        activation of taste <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors stimulates</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-coupled cascade resulting in activation of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phospholipase</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PLC</ENAMEX>), which cleaves phosphoinositol
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bisphosphate</ENAMEX> (PIP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> ) to produce the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">messengers</ENAMEX> IP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> and diacylglycerol (DAG). The soluble
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">messenger IP</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> binds to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> located on calcium
        store membranes, causing release of calcium into the
        cytosol, while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAG</ENAMEX> remains in the membrane, where it can
        activate downstream <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">effectors</ENAMEX>. While little is known about
        the role of IP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> in sweet taste transduction,
        considerable data indicate that IP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> plays an important role in bitter
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transduction</ENAMEX>. The first evidence for the involvement of IP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> in bitter transduction was obtained by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Akabas et al.</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>], who used Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+imaging to show that the
        bitter stimulus denatonium causes release of Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intracellular</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX>. More recently, biochemical
        measurements have shown that several bitter compounds
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">elevate</ENAMEX> IP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> in taste tissue [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6 7 8</NUMEX> ] .
        Other studies, however, suggested that a decrease in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cAMP</ENAMEX>, rather than an increase in IP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mediated</ENAMEX> bitter transduction. In
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX>, a chemosensory specific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, α-gustducin, was
        identified in a subset of taste cells [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>].
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alpha-gustducin</ENAMEX>, which is closely related to the rod and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cone</ENAMEX> transducins, activates <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PDE</ENAMEX> to reduce intracellular
        levels of cAMP [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>]. Evidence for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">gustducin</TIMEX>'s role in
        bitter taste came from knockout studies, in which a
        targeted deletion of α-gustducin resulted in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> with a
        reduced sensitivity for bitter compounds [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>]. More
        recently, a variety of bitter compounds have been shown to
        activate gustducin in biochemical assays [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11, 12</TIMEX>], causing
        a decrease in intracellular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cAMP</ENAMEX> levels via activation of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PDE</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>]. It is now known that individual bitter receptors
        modulate both the IP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cAMP pathways</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1B). Bitter
        compounds bind to a family of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-coupled receptors</ENAMEX>
        called the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">T2R</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14, 15</TIMEX>] or TRB [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>] <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>, which
        activate a heterotrimeric <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> protein consisting of
        α-gustducin and a βγ <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">β3</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>] and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">γ13</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alpha</ENAMEX>-gustducin activates <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PDE</ENAMEX> to decrease intracellular
        levels of cAMP [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>], while its βγ <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> stimulate PLCβ2
        to produce IP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAG</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>].
        Although it is clear that IP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> binds to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> located on
        intracellular Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX>, the specific identity of IP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> in taste cells is not known.
        There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 3</NUMEX> known isotypes of IP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors encoded</ENAMEX> by different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX>]. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein product</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 300</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kda</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> subunits
        assemble to form a functional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX>. Both homomultimeres
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heteromultimeres</ENAMEX> have been reported [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>]. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>
        terminus of each <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">subunit</ENAMEX> houses the IP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> binding domain while the C terminus
        anchors the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> to the membrane, is involved in the
        formation of the tetrameric <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, and forms the Ca
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+pore region. The general structure of each isoform is
        similar, however they differ in primary sequence,
        distribution, regulation, and IP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> affinity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>].
        In this study we used immunocytochemical methods to
        determine which IP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> R isoform is expressed in taste cells
        and to examine the expression patterns of IP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> relative to other proteins
        known to be important for taste transduction. We report
        that the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Type III</ENAMEX> IP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> is the dominant isotype
        expressed in rodent taste cells and that it is primarily
        found in the same subset of taste cells as other known
        signaling components of bitter transduction. A preliminary
        account of this work was published in abstract form [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>].

          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Forty micron</NUMEX> thick rat sections containing

          secondary antibodies. Laser scanning confocal microscopy
          of the resultant <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX> was used to examine the
          distribution of IP 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> receptor immunoreactivity in rat
          circumvallate taste <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">buds</ENAMEX>. Labeling for IP

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3 R2</ENAMEX> was negligible (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Figs.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2A</ENAMEX>, B). In
          contrast, immunoreactivity to IP 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3 R3</ENAMEX> was robust and present in a large
          subset of taste cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2C). Generally,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunoreactivity</ENAMEX> extended throughout the cytoplasm of
          labeled cells. Immunoreactivity was found only in taste
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">buds</ENAMEX> and was not present in the lingual epithelium
          surrounding taste <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">buds</ENAMEX>. Primarily intragemmal taste cells
          were labeled, proliferative basal cells of the taste buds
          did not appear to be labeled. In addition, gustatory
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nerve fibers</ENAMEX> did not appear to be labeled. Controls in
          which the primary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> was omitted showed no specific

          To determine if IP 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> R3 could be involved in bitter taste
          transduction, we performed double-label
          immunocytochemistry with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> to IP 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3 R3</ENAMEX> and components of the bitter
          signaling pathway. For most experiments, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> as well as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat tissues</ENAMEX> were examined. Exposure of tissue to
          antibodies against α-gustducin and IP 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> R3 showed that all α-gustducin
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunoreactive</ENAMEX> (IR) cells were also immunoreactive for IP
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3 R3</ENAMEX>, however, a subset of IP 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> R3-IR taste cells lacked
          α-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">gustducin</NUMEX>-IR (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). Further analysis with antibodies
          to other signaling components of the bitter transduction
          pathway are shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Figs.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4- 5</ENAMEX>. Immunoreactivity for
          PLCβ2 and IP 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> R3 showed nearly complete
          coincidence of labeling (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). Immunoreactivity for
          PLCβ2 extended throughout the cytoplasm, as did
          immunoreactivity for IP 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3 R3.</ENAMEX> However, some taste cells
          appeared to differ in the degree of labeling for each
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX>, with some cells showing more intense label for
          IP 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3 R3</ENAMEX> and others for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PLCβ2</TIMEX>. We also
          compared IP 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> R3 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IR</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">γ13</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IR</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> and mouse
          circumvallate taste <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">buds</ENAMEX>. As shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>, nearly
          complete co-localization was again observed for both
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antigens</ENAMEX>. Results from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PLCβ2</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">γ13</NUMEX> double label
          experiments were similar for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> taste <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">buds</ENAMEX>.
          Taken together, these immunocytochemical data indicate
          that IP 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3 R3</ENAMEX> is the predominant isoform of IP 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> receptor expressed in taste cells,
          and that it is found in the same subset of taste cells as
          other components known to be involved with bitter taste
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transduction</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        IP 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3 R3</ENAMEX> is heavily expressed in a large
        subset of vallate taste cells of both <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX>,
        suggesting that IP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 R3</NUMEX> plays a similar role in both
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>. IP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> R3 appears to be located throughout
        the cytoplasm of taste cells, consistent with its expected
        location on the smooth endoplasmic membrane [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>]. In other
        cells, IP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> have also been found on the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">plasma membrane</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>], but because of heavy cytoplasmic
        labeling, we were unable to resolve whether it was also
        located on the plasma membrane. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> caveat is that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">retrieval</ENAMEX> was necessary to observe IP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> R3 labeling. However, using this
        method with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">α-gustducin</NUMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PLCβ2</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">γ13</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> did not
        alter their immunoreactivities; similar results were
        obtained with and without <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen retrieval</ENAMEX>. Thus, we do
        not believe that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> retrieval compromised our
        interpretation of the results.
        Taste cells expressing IP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> R3 have an elongate, bipolar
        morphology, suggestive of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Type II</ENAMEX> taste cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>].
        Indeed, a subset of the IP 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3 R3</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">immunoreactive</ENAMEX> taste cells is also
        immunoreactive for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">α-gustducin</NUMEX>, which has been identified
        exclusively in <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Type II</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cells</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>]. However, whether IP 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3 R3</ENAMEX> is expressed exclusively in <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Type II</ENAMEX>
        cells awaits further investigation. It is noteworthy that a
        subset of taste cells does not express IP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>. This raises the question as
        to whether these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cells</ENAMEX> have intracellular Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+release
        mechanisms. Ryanodine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> also mediate release of Ca
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+from intracellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX>, however a previous study
        showed no effect of ryanodine on bitter taste responses in 
        Necturus taste cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>].
        IP 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3 R3</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">immunoreactivity</ENAMEX> was expressed in
        the same subset of taste cells as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PLCβ2</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">γ13</NUMEX>, and by
        inference from other data, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">β3</NUMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>]. Antibodies against
        these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> have been shown to inhibit IP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> formation to bitter compounds in taste
        cells [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8, 17, 18</ENAMEX>], suggesting that they are important
        components of the bitter-stimulated IP 
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3 pathway.</TIMEX> It is of interest that only a
        subset of IP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> R3 IR cells express α-gustducin, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> known to be involved with bitter transduction.
        These data suggest that alpha subunit(s) in addition to
        α-gustducin must be involved with the IP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> signaling pathway in α-gustducin
        negative cells. Several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> protein alpha subunits have been
        identified in taste cells, and are potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> for
        this role. These include <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">α-transducin</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>], <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Gαi-2</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Gαi-3</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gαs</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>], and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Gα15</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gαq</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>]. Further experiments will
        be required to identify the additional alpha subunits that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> to this pathway, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> that activate
        these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>.
        In addition to its role in bitter transduction, IP 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX> is involved in the transduction of
        artificial sweeteners [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>]. Interestingly, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> lacking
        α-gustducin are compromised in the detection of sweet
        compounds as well as bitter compounds, suggesting that
        sweet <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> may also <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">couple</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">α-gustducin</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>].
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Approximately</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two-thirds</NUMEX> of the α-gustducin positive
        vallate taste cells express <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T2R/TRB</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>]. It is
        possible that the remaining α-gustducin positive vallate
        taste cells express <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> for synthetic sweeteners, and
        that they couple to the IP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> signaling pathway. Thus, IP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> R3 may be involved with sweet as well
        as bitter taste transduction.
        IP 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3 R3</ENAMEX> is widely expressed in cells in a
        variety of tissues including adult pancreatic islets,
        kidney, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">gastrointestinal</NUMEX> tract, salivary glands, and brain
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29, 30</TIMEX>]. Many of these cell types, including taste cells,
        are polarized, where Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+signals are initiated on the
        apical membrane and must propagate long intracellular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">distances</ENAMEX>. IP 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3 R3</ENAMEX> is particularly well suited for
        this function, since it is the only IP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> receptor isotype that is not inhibited
        at high Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+concentrations [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX>]. In fact, under certain
        conditions, Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+can stimulate IP 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3 R3</ENAMEX>, making it a likely candidate for
        participation in the propagation of Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+oscillations. In
        taste cells Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">oscillations</ENAMEX> have been observed in
        response to bitter stimuli (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T. Ogura</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">S.C. Kinnamon</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unpub</ENAMEX>. observations), and it's likely that IP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> R3 participates in these Ca
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+oscillations.
        Another interesting feature of IP 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3 R3</ENAMEX> is that cAMP-dependent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylation</ENAMEX> can inhibit its activity in pancreatic
        acinar cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32, 33</TIMEX>]. In these cells, cAMP-dependent
        phosphorylation decreases Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+release from intracellular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> and slows the frequency of Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+oscillations. These
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> suggest a possible role for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">α-gustducin</NUMEX> in bitter
        taste transduction. Specifically, activation of
        α-gustducin, which decreases intracellular <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cAMP</ENAMEX> by
        activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PDE</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>], may lead to a decrease in the
        cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of IP 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3 R3.</ENAMEX> This would disrupt the negative
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> and potentiate the Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+response.
        Interestingly, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Gαi-2</ENAMEX>, another alpha subunit heavily
        expressed in taste cells [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>], also functions to decrease
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intracellular</ENAMEX> levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cAMP</ENAMEX> and may lead to regulation of
        IP 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3 R3.</ENAMEX> Further experiments will be
        necessary to clarify the role of these alpha subunits in
        regulation of the IP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> pathway in taste cells.
      
      
        Conclusions
        The principal finding in this study is the
        identification of IP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> R3 as the dominant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">isoform</ENAMEX> of the IP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> in taste cells. IP 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX> has been shown to be an important
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">messenger</ENAMEX> in both bitter and sweet taste
        transduction, and IP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> R3 likely mediates the Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+release
        from intracellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> in response to IP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> . In bitter taste transduction, many
        signaling components have been identified, and IP 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3 R3</ENAMEX> is co-expressed in the same taste
        cells (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). Bitter stimuli bind to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T2R/TRB</ENAMEX> taste
        receptors coupled to a heterotrimeric <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> protein complex
        consisting of α-gustducin and its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partners</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">β3 and γ13</NUMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alpha</ENAMEX> gustducin activates <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PDE</ENAMEX>, causing decreases in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">intracellular</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cAMP</ENAMEX>, while its βγ <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">partners</ENAMEX> stimulate PLCβ2
        to produce IP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DAG</ENAMEX>. IP 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> subsequently binds to IP 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3 R3</ENAMEX>, causing increases in cytosolic Ca
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+, due to release from intracellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stores</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1B). The
        unique properties of IP 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3 R3</ENAMEX>, including its regulation by Ca
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">cAMP</ENAMEX> dependent kinases, are consistent with known
        characteristics of bitter signaling in taste cells.
