        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Stroke</ENAMEX> is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> leading cause of death in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>.
        The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> basic types of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> are ischemic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hemorrhagic stroke</ENAMEX>. In ischemic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX>, the most common
        type, a profound disturbance of focal cerebral blood flow
        leads to irreversible parenchymal injury. The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Siblings With</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ischemic Stroke Study</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SWISS</ENAMEX>) is a multicenter affected
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">sibling</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> study with the aim of identifying chromosomal
        regions linked to ischemic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> by using genome-wide
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">scanning</ENAMEX>. Family history and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">twins</ENAMEX> studies support the
        existence of genetic susceptibility to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3 4</NUMEX> ] .
        Mendelian disorders known to be associated with an
        increased risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> include hemoglobinopathies,
        dyslipoproteinemias, and cardioembolic disorders [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] .
        Most known Mendelian <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke disorders</ENAMEX> present in infancy,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">childhood</ENAMEX>, or young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adulthood</ENAMEX> and collectively represent
        only a small proportion of all <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> cases. Several of
        these <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Mendelian disorders</ENAMEX> were recognized as unique genetic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> because of striking phenotypic features, such as
        corneal opacities and angiokeratomas of the skin in Fabry
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>.
        Defining the genetic basis for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> syndromes that
        lack striking phenotypic features is a more difficult task.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Model-dependent</ENAMEX> linkage analysis has been used in large
        pedigrees with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> such as cerebral autosomal dominant
        arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">leukoencephalopathy</ENAMEX> (CADASIL) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7 8 9</NUMEX> ] . However,
        traditional linkage analysis is unlikely to be the most
        expedient method of finding novel stroke-susceptibility
        genes when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">carrier</ENAMEX> status cannot be defined on the basis of
        distinctive clinical, radiographic, or laboratory
        features.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> popular method of identifying genetic risk factors
        has been the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> gene <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> study, in which
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> compare rates of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or more variant
        polymorphisms of a candidate gene among <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> cases and
        stroke-free controls. Identifying risk factors depends on
        selecting the right candidate genes, a daunting task
        because the human genome harbors <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 30,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>. A
        candidate gene is usually selected because the gene product
        might relate to pathogenesis of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>.
        Numerous studies have used a candidate gene approach to
        define genetic risk factors for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX>, but so far results
        for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several</NUMEX> categories of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> genes have been
        negative or conflicting. For example, because <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 80%</NUMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">strokes</ENAMEX> are caused by thrombotic occlusion of a blood
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">vessel</ENAMEX>, genes related to the coagulation system would seem
        logical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> for susceptibility to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX>. However,
        despite <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of the factor V G1691A (factor V
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leiden</ENAMEX>) and prothrombin (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX>) G20210A mutations with
        venous thromboembolism and myocardial infarction [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11</NUMEX> ]
        , neither mutation is strongly associated with risk of
        stroke [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13 14 15 16 17 18</NUMEX> ] . Although a study of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">British</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> found elevated levels of serum homocysteine
        to be associated with an increased risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] ,
        a case-control study of a common polymorphism
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase</ENAMEX> [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTHFR</ENAMEX>] T677C) that
        results in increased serum homocysteine concentrations
        found no difference between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> and
        controls in either genotype or allele frequency [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] .
        Because antiplatelet <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> with different mechanisms of
        action can bring about significant reductions in stroke
        risk, several <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">platelet receptor genes</ENAMEX> have been tested as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">candidate stroke susceptibility</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 22</NUMEX> ] . To date,
        however, no compelling evidence for an association between
        any <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">platelet receptor gene polymorphism</ENAMEX> and risk of stroke
        has been found.
        Conflicting results have been reported from studies on
        the stroke risk factor status of genes related to
        myocardial infarction or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">arterial disease</ENAMEX>, such as specific
        genotypes of the genes for angiotensin <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-converting enzyme
        ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ACE</ENAMEX> ) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 24 25 26</NUMEX> ] or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">apolipoprotein</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34</NUMEX> ] . Potential
        confounding factors include the effects of comorbidity and
        differential mortality rates [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34 35</NUMEX> ] . Although the
        degree of stenosis of the cervical internal carotid
        arteries in symptomatic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> correlates with risk of
        ipsilateral stroke [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] , no clear conclusions can be
        drawn from attempts to relate <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">carotid artery disease</ENAMEX> to
        specific genotypes (for example, of the paraoxonase gene 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PON</ENAMEX>, which is thought to protect
        low-density lipoprotein against oxidative modification [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37</NUMEX>
        ] , or of the endothelial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nitric oxide synthase gene</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ]
        ).
        Thus, results of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> gene approach have so far
        failed to define genetic risk factors for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX>.
        Furthermore, if important functional mutations should arise
        in noncoding regions without significant disequilibrium
        with the site of a screened polymorphism, the association
        analysis may exclude the true disease susceptibility
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">locus</ENAMEX>.
        A genome-wide scanning approach in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">sibling</NUMEX> pairs may
        expedite discovery of novel risk factor genes. The basic
        goal of the genome-wide scan with microsatellite markers is
        to identify chromosomal regions linked to a disease
        phenotype by determining whether polymorphisms in the
        microsatellite markers segregate with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> within a
        cohort of pedigrees. Microsatellites are not functional;
        they are noncoding regions of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> that allow identification
        of chromosomal regions held in common by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pedigree</ENAMEX>.
        The collection of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">sibling</NUMEX> pairs and analysis of mean
        proportion of alleles shared that are identical (by descent
        or state) by use of a highly polymorphic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> of genetic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">markers</ENAMEX> has come to be a standard protocol for detecting
        linkage of a disease susceptibility locus to a chromosomal
        region. The technique has been applied to a broad range of
        other disorders, including <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple sclerosis</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39 40 41 42</NUMEX>
        ] , <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Alzheimer disease</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43 44 45</NUMEX> ] , type 1 diabetes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX> ]
        , type 2 diabetes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX> ] , asthma [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX> ] , and systemic
        lupus erythematosus [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">49</TIMEX> ] . The use of such
        linkage-mapping strategies offers the advantage of
        model-independence, computational speed, and systematic
        identification of novel loci [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] .
        Thus, linkage analysis using a genome-wide scan may
        yield positive results more efficiently than testing
        candidate genes a few at a time. However, we do not
        consider these approaches to be mutually exclusive.
        Genome-wide linkage analysis may guide selective candidate
        gene evaluations within regions of importance. The goal of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SWISS</ENAMEX> is to help to identify the chromosomal regions that
        should be searched for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> genes.
        The paucity of genome-wide scanning studies in the
        stroke literature to date is mainly due to theoretical and
        logistical factors that make such studies difficult to
        design. Ischemic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> itself represents a heterogeneous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenotype</ENAMEX>. Various <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">systems</ENAMEX> have been used to classify
        subtypes of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ischemic stroke</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> ] . For example, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trial</ENAMEX>
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ORG10172</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acute Stroke Treatment</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TOAST</ENAMEX>) investigators
        classified stroke into large-artery atherosclerosis,
        cardioembolism, small-<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessel occlusion</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> of other
        etiology, and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> of undetermined etiology [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">51</TIMEX> ] .
        Uncertainty exists as to whether the clinical heterogeneity
        of the ischemic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke phenotype</ENAMEX> relates to heterogeneity
        in genetic risk factors.
        Logistically, the collection of a large number of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sibling</ENAMEX> pairs concordant for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> is a daunting task.
        Stroke affects an elderly <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> and carries a modest
        case fatality rate. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> may be rendered incompetent to
        consent to a genetics study by the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> itself. Often,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of a sibship are separated by large geographical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">distances</ENAMEX>. In a preliminary study, we found that, whereas <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
        in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> report having a living affected
        sibling, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 1</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> had an affected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sibling</ENAMEX> living in the
        same <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">city</ENAMEX> as the proband [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">52</TIMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SWISS</ENAMEX> is designed to overcome these hurdles as far as
        possible. The purpose of this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> is to describe the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SWISS</ENAMEX> protocol in detail.

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aim</ENAMEX>
          The aim of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SWISS</ENAMEX> is to test the hypothesis that the
          human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genome</ENAMEX> contains chromosomal regions associated with
          ischemic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> by means of genome-wide scanning in DNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">samples</ENAMEX> collected from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300 sibling</NUMEX> pairs concordant for
          ischemic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> and from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> discordant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">siblings</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Definition of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ischemic stroke</ENAMEX> and its
          subtypes
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Stroke</ENAMEX> is defined according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Health</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Organization</ENAMEX> criteria [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53</TIMEX> ] as rapidly developing signs
          of a focal or global disturbance of cerebral function,
          with symptoms lasting <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX> or longer or leading to
          death with no apparent cause other than vascular origin.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> are classified as having an ischemic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> if
          they had computed tomographic or magnetic resonance
          imaging of the brain done within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7 days</TIMEX> of onset of
          symptoms that either identified the symptomatic cerebral
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">infarct</ENAMEX> or failed to identify an alternative cause of the
          symptoms. Classification of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">strokes</ENAMEX> into subtypes is done
          according to the validated TOAST diagnostic criteria [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">51</NUMEX>
          ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Subtype</ENAMEX> diagnosis is made on the basis of available
          and relevant information obtained <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">up to 3 months</TIMEX> after
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX>, because initial subtype diagnosis varies from
          final diagnosis in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately one-third</NUMEX> of cases [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">54</NUMEX>
          ] .
        
        
          Study population
          
            Probands
            Probands are adult <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">men</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> who 1) have a
            diagnosis of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 1</NUMEX> ischemic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> confirmed by
            the study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neurologist</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) report having <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 1</NUMEX>
            living full sibling with a history of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>)
            have attained their <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">18th</NUMEX> birthday at the time of
            enrollment in the study. If <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">probands</ENAMEX> have had more than
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> ischemic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX>, the most recent is the proband
            index <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX>. Probands are not excluded from the study
            for radiographic evidence of hemorrhagic transformation
            of an ischemic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX>.
            Probands are not enrolled if any of the following
            conditions apply: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) The index stroke is presumed to be
            iatrogenic - that is, onset of symptoms occurred within
            <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">48 hours</TIMEX> after an invasive cerebrovascular or
            cardiovascular procedure, such as coronary artery
            bypass grafting, a catheter-based procedure on carotid
            or coronary arteries, carotid endarterectomy, heart
            valve surgery, or thoracic or thoracoabdominal aortic
            aneurysm repair. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) The index stroke is presumed due to
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vasospasm</ENAMEX> after nontraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage -
            that is, the onset of symptoms occurred within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">60 days</TIMEX>
            after the onset of a nontraumatic subarachnoid
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hemorrhage</ENAMEX>. Virtually all delayed cerebral ischemia
            occurs <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5 to 21 days</TIMEX> after subarachnoid hemorrhage [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">55</NUMEX>
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">56</NUMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) The index stroke is presumed due to an
            autoimmune <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">condition</ENAMEX> - that is, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> has a
            history of brain-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">biopsy</NUMEX>-proven central nervous system
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vasculitis</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> is known to have any of the
            following single-gene or mitochondrial disorders
            recognized by a distinctive phenotype: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CADASIL</ENAMEX>, Fabry
            <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, homocystinuria, mitochondrial encephalopathy
            with lactic acidosis and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX>-like episodes (MELAS),
            or sickle cell <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">anemia</ENAMEX>. We excluded probands with these
            disorders because their enrollment might confound the
            genome scan for novel risk factors. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>) The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> had
            a mechanical aortic valve or a mechanical mitral valve
            at the time of index stroke onset. We chose this
            criterion because of the high likelihood that ischemic
            <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> is iatrogenic in such <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>) The patient
            had untreated or actively treated bacterial
            endocarditis at the time of index stroke onset.
          
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Concordant Siblings</ENAMEX>
            To be enrolled as a concordant sibling, the subject
            must have a full sibling enrolled as a proband in
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SWISS</ENAMEX>. Other eligibility criteria for concordant
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">siblings</ENAMEX> are identical to those of probands. Both
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proband</ENAMEX> and concordant sibling must be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 18</NUMEX>
            <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years old</TIMEX> at the time of enrollment and both must meet
            the same definition of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ischemic stroke</ENAMEX>. For concordant
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">siblings</ENAMEX>, the diagnosis of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ischemic stroke</ENAMEX> is verified
            retrospectively by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stroke Verification Committee</ENAMEX>
            (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SVC</ENAMEX>). This is a central, genotype-blinded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committee</ENAMEX> of
            study-appointed <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neurologists</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appendix</ENAMEX>), which
            adjudicates the diagnosis and subtype of ischemic
            stroke for concordant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">siblings</ENAMEX>, using standardized,
            prespecified criteria. Although the subtype of the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sibling</ENAMEX>'s index ischemic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> is determined,
            enrollment is not restricted to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">siblings</ENAMEX> with the same
            ischemic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke subtype</ENAMEX> as probands.
          
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Discordant Siblings</ENAMEX>
            Inclusion criteria for discordant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">siblings</ENAMEX> are as
            follows: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) The subject has attained his or her 18th
            birthday at the time of enrollment. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) The subject has
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> or more full <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">siblings</ENAMEX> who each have had an ischemic
            <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> and who are participating in the study. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) The
            subject reports having no medical history of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> or
            <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">transient ischemic attack</ENAMEX> (TIA) and denies ever having
            had symptoms of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX>. Because a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">SWISS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">proband</ENAMEX> might
            erroneously believe that a sibling never had a stroke,
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">discordance</ENAMEX> is considered verified only if the sibling
            can be contacted for a structured telephone interview
            and gives negative answers to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all 8</NUMEX> items on the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Questionnaire for Verifying Stroke-Free Status</ENAMEX> (QVSFS)
            (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">57 58</NUMEX> ] . Discordant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">siblings</ENAMEX> are excluded
            if they are deemed unreliable <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">historians</ENAMEX> in the opinion
            of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">interviewer</ENAMEX> administering the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QVSFS</ENAMEX> on the basis
            of global impression of moderate or severe impairment
            of speech, language, hearing, or memory.
          
        
        
          Recruitment goals
          We aim to enroll <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 300</NUMEX> concordant sibling pairs
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">300 probands</NUMEX> plus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> concordant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">siblings</ENAMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX>
          discordant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">siblings</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">800</NUMEX> total study subjects). Because
          it is likely that not all concordant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">siblings</ENAMEX> will
          actually participate, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 300</NUMEX> probands will be
          enrolled to obtain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> concordant sibling
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pairs</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Study procedures
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phase I. Enrolling Probands</ENAMEX> and Recruiting
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Siblings</ENAMEX>
            Screening and enrollment will take place at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>
            participating <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX>
            (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appendix</ENAMEX>). At each <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, a study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neurologist</ENAMEX> screens
            all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with a possible diagnosis of ischemic
            stroke to identify potential <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">SWISS</ENAMEX> probands, orders or
            reviews medical tests pertinent to the diagnosis and
            subtyping of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ischemic stroke</ENAMEX> as part of routine
            clinical practice, and makes a new diagnosis or
            confirms a previous diagnosis of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ischemic stroke</ENAMEX> in a
            potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">proband</ENAMEX>. A certified study neurologist
            classifies the final subtype of the index stroke
            according to TOAST criteria [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">51</TIMEX> ] . To obtain
            certification the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neurologist</ENAMEX> reads the original
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">manuscript</ENAMEX> describing the TOAST classification system
            and scores various <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> presented in a series of
            stanardized clinical vignettes according to TOAST
            criteria. The scores are compared with reference values
            generated by a consensus of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SVC</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigator</ENAMEX>
            receives feedback on any deviations from reference
            values and is required to review the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TOAST</ENAMEX>
            classification system and retake the test.
            The local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coordinator</ENAMEX> or study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neurologist</ENAMEX> conducts
            a face-to-face interview with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who meet
            enrollment criteria to obtain their medical history and
            to explain the study. If <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> agree to participate
            in the study, they sign and date <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> copies of the
            informed consent form, retaining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> copy for themselves.
            The local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">coordinator</ENAMEX> completes the proband case report
            forms (CRFs), assigns a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SWISS</ENAMEX> study number to the
            proband, forwards the proband <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CRFs</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinical</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coordinating Center</ENAMEX>, and gives the proband (or
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">surrogate</ENAMEX>) a set of study invitation letters to be sent
            to all of his or her living full <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">siblings</ENAMEX>. In the
            letter, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">siblings</ENAMEX> are asked to indicate whether they are
            interested in participating in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SWISS</ENAMEX> by completing the
            contact information section and sending it to the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinical Coordinating Center</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center assigns SWISS</ENAMEX>
            numbers to all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">siblings</ENAMEX> who provide contact
            information.
          
          
            Phase II. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Verifying Concordance</ENAMEX> and
            Discordance
            The goal of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Phase II</ENAMEX> is to confirm that phenotyping
            of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">siblings</ENAMEX> is accurate.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Discordance</ENAMEX> is confirmed in Phase <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIA</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinical</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coordinating Center</ENAMEX> contacts potentially discordant
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">siblings</ENAMEX> who provide contact information, obtains
            verbal consent for a brief telephone interview,
            administers the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QVSFS</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>), and obtains a
            standardized medical history in a structured telephone
            interview. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Siblings</ENAMEX> who give negative answers to the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QVSFS</ENAMEX> medical history items but who give a positive
            response to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> or more of the review-of-symptoms items
            are advised to inform their primary care <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX> of
            their symptoms so that they can be evaluated
            accordingly. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Siblings</ENAMEX> who respond positively to QVSFS
            <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">item 1</ENAMEX> advance to Phase <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIB</ENAMEX>. If all of the QVSFS items
            are negative, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> is considered a verified
            discordant sibling. The discordant sibling CRFs are
            completed during the telephone interview, and the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinical Coordinating Center</ENAMEX> sends <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> copies of the
            Informed Consent Form (ICF) to the verified discordant
            sibling, who returns <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1</TIMEX> signed copy to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center</ENAMEX> and
            retains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> copy. Verified discordant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">siblings</ENAMEX> advance to
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phase III</ENAMEX> of the study.
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Concordance</ENAMEX> is confirmed in Phase <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIB</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinical</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coordinating Center</ENAMEX> sends potentially concordant
            siblings a Request for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medical Records Form</ENAMEX> (RMRF) and
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> copies of the informed consent form to sign, date,
            and return. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RMRF</ENAMEX> is a slightly modified
            study-specific version of the official form used by
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mayo Clinic</ENAMEX> for routine patient care. Subjects return 1
            copy of the signed form in a pre-addressed,
            postage-paid envelope provided with the original form
            and retain the second copy. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinical Coordinating</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center</ENAMEX> uses the signed form to request medical records
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pertaining</ENAMEX> to the sibling index <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center</ENAMEX>
            constructs a file of medical records in a standardized,
            subdivided sequence (hospital admission notes and
            discharge summaries; neurologic consultation notes;
            reports of computed tomographic and magnetic resonance
            imaging of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX>; reports of imaging of the heart by
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transthoracic</ENAMEX> and transesophageal echocardiography;
            copies of electrocardiograms; reports of imaging of
            cervicocephalic vasculature by angiography using
            conventional, computed tomographic, or magnetic
            resonance techniques or by ultrasonography; and reports
            of blood work).
            The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Clinical Coordinating Center</ENAMEX> submits completed
            files on potentially concordant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">siblings</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SVC</ENAMEX> on
            a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekly</TIMEX> basis. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neurologist member</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SVC</ENAMEX> reviews
            the files and attempts to confirm the diagnosis of
            ischemic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX>, using a standard stroke work-up
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">checklist</ENAMEX> to assist with and document a systematic
            review of the medical records. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SVC</ENAMEX> may instruct the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinical Coordinating Center</ENAMEX> to secure additional
            medical records if the initial set fails to provide
            sufficient evidence to confirm the diagnosis of
            ischemic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX>. If the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SVC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neurologist</ENAMEX> cannot confirm
            the diagnosis of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX>, the potentially concordant
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sibling</ENAMEX> does not advance in the study. If concordance
            is confirmed, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SVC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">neurologist</ENAMEX> classifies the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TOAST</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke subtype</ENAMEX>, completes the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CRFs</ENAMEX> for the concordant
            sibling, and forwards the forms to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinical</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coordinating Center</ENAMEX>.
            Although <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as many as 10%</NUMEX> of the concordant siblings
            in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SWISS</ENAMEX> may have a history of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> or more strokes, the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SVC</ENAMEX> confirms the diagnosis and classifies the subtype
            of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ischemic stroke</ENAMEX> only for the most recent stroke for
            which there are records sufficient to confirm the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">diagnosis</ENAMEX> (the sibling index <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX>). The verified
            concordant sibling then advances to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phase III</ENAMEX>.
          
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phase III</ENAMEX>. Acquiring <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Blood</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genetic</ENAMEX>
            Analysis
            <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Blood samples</ENAMEX> are taken only when a study pedigree
            is complete, i.e., clinical data and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICF</ENAMEX> are available
            from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> proband and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 1</NUMEX> verified concordant
            sibling, with or without 1 verified discordant sibling.
            If the diagnosis of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ischemic stroke</ENAMEX> cannot be verified
            for any sibling of a proband, the clinical data from
            that proband are saved, but no <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood samples</ENAMEX> are
            collected. When a pedigree is complete, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clinical</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coordinating Center</ENAMEX> instructs the home health <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> to
            collect <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood samples</ENAMEX> from all pedigree <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>. A
            phlebotomist from the home health <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> visits the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> at their homes, obtains a blood sample, and
            ships it to the DNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bank</ENAMEX>.
          
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phase IV</ENAMEX>. Genome-wide Scan
            The DNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bank</ENAMEX> creates cell lines and notifies the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genetics Laboratory</ENAMEX> when <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> concordant sibling pair
            specimens are ready for analysis. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genetics</ENAMEX>
            Laboratory then performs the genome-wide scan.
          
        
        
          Measures of outcome
          The primary outcome is the degree of linkage between
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke phenotype</ENAMEX> and genetic markers as measured by
          the proportion of alleles shared by concordant sibling
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pairs</ENAMEX> (accumulated over all pairs at each marker).
        
        
          Clinical database
          For each proband, we collect name, date of birth,
          gender, race, home address, home phone number, e-mail
          address, and alternative contact information. We record
          the enrolling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigator</ENAMEX>'s study number and the study
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">center</ENAMEX> number to assure accurate attribution of efforts
          and to make it possible to verify entries in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CRFs</ENAMEX> with
          source documents. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> are collected on stroke risk
          factors and medical history, date of onset of stroke
          symptoms, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">TOAST stroke subtype</ENAMEX>, and the total number of
          living full <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">siblings</ENAMEX>.
          The following information is collected on all living
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">full</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">siblings</ENAMEX> who return sibling response letters: name,
          date of birth, gender, name of the proband they are
          related to, twin status, home address, home phone number,
          e-mail address, alternative contact information, and
          standardized risk factor and medical history.
          In addition, for each concordant sibling, we record
          date of review of outside medical records, a stroke
          work-up checklist addressing medical reports reviewed by
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician member</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SVC</ENAMEX> who confirms stroke
          concordance, date of onset of index stroke (and of first
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX>, if sibling had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TOAST</ENAMEX> subtype of
          index stroke, and responses to all items contained in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QVSFS</ENAMEX>. For discordant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">siblings</ENAMEX>, we record responses to
          all items contained in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QVSFS</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Genotyping
          Local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> receive blood shipping kits, including a
          Vacutainer for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX>, by mail at the start of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SWISS</ENAMEX>, and
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Clinical Coordinating Center</ENAMEX> will restock the supply
          on a continuing basis. Used kits are shipped <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">overnight</TIMEX> to
          the DNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bank</ENAMEX> for processing. Lymphoblastoid cell lines
          will be generated from peripheral <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood leukocytes</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> extracted using routine methods. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> analysis will
          begin after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 300th</TIMEX> concordant sibling <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">enrolled</ENAMEX>, which we anticipate to be at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of year 4</TIMEX>.
          At that time, the DNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bank</ENAMEX> will ship <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 50</NUMEX> μg of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genetics Laboratory</ENAMEX>.
          At the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genetics Laboratory</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> will be plated
          onto <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">384</NUMEX>-well plates for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">marker genotyping</ENAMEX>. The ABI
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genescan/Genotyper</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> will be employed in
          semiautomated fluorescent genotyping, comparing fragment
          sizes to an internal standard of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">CEPH DNA</ENAMEX>. An <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ABI377</TIMEX> with
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX> wells generates the marker data. All genotypes will be
          scored blind to phenotype. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Two hundred thirty</TIMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX>
          microsatellite markers, obtained from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Genethon</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CHLC</ENAMEX>, and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GDB</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">106 di-</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">21 tri-</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">110</NUMEX> tetranucleotides), will be
          typed in all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">sibling</NUMEX> pairs. These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">237</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">markers</ENAMEX> have been
          sorted into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> panels. We will run <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">92</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> per gel
          (with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lanes</ENAMEX> for controls); <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">estimating ~920 samples</ENAMEX> at
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panels</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> gels will be needed. Allowing for reruns
          and data loss, we estimate that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</NUMEX> gels will be required
          to complete this task and extract <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">greater than 90%</NUMEX> of the
          genetic data. The average distance between adjacent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">markers</ENAMEX> in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> series is <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">16.3 cM</NUMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1-40 cM</TIMEX>).
          Average heterozygosity will be calculated. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CRI-MAP</ENAMEX>
          program will determine intermarker distances and will
          also be used to form the study-specific genetic map. A
          genotype database (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Megabase</ENAMEX>) will be used to check the
          binning of alleles, convert allele sizes to whole
          numbers, and (where possible) to test for non-Mendelian
          inheritance. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Megabase</ENAMEX> will store all relevant
          genotypic/phenotypic data and produce all files needed
          for statistical analysis.
        
        
          Cell lines
          We regard banking of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> to be a key element of
          this study. Collection of clinical samples is expensive
          and time consuming, and it is probable that progress in
          identifying genes involved in stroke will be incremental.
          For <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> of smaller effect, very large sample sizes are
          likely to be needed. Having these resources available
          will ensure that future work can build effectively on the
          work we present here. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Epstein-Barr</ENAMEX> virus-transformed
          lymphoblastoid cell lines will be used.
        
        
          Statistical methods
          For the concordant sibling pair design, the proportion
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alleles</ENAMEX> shared by the concordant sibling pairs
          (accumulated over all pairs at that marker) is the
          statistic that determines evidence for linkage between
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke phenotype</ENAMEX> and the genetic marker. If only
          concordant sibling pairs are collected, a maximum of only
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">alleles</ENAMEX> can be identified. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> (discordant)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sibling</ENAMEX> is collected for purposes of determining
          potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nonpaternities</ENAMEX> in a sibship (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 4</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alleles</ENAMEX>) and for better estimating the proportion of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alleles</ENAMEX> shared that are identical by state (in the
          absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>).
          Traditional applications of gene mapping have used
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> in which the trait (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>) is transmitted in a
          clearly <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mendelian</ENAMEX> fashion. For more complex traits, the
          inheritance pattern does not fit a single-gene model, and
          methods that assume a genetic model may provide erroneous
          results [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">59</TIMEX> ] . Ischemic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> clearly demonstrates
          familial aggregation, yet no single-gene model of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transmission</ENAMEX> is consistent with the family data. In this
          project, we propose to use model-independent (relative
          pair) analysis, a method that is designed to detect
          linkage without the specification of an underlying
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genetic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> and that is robust to contributions by
          environmental variation. The methods of analysis for
          determination of risk factor loci will mainly use the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SPLINK</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPMAKER/SIBS</ENAMEX> programs [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60 61</NUMEX> ] .
        
        
          Estimates of power to detect linkage
          For concordant sibling pair studies, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Risch</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">62 63</NUMEX> ]
          demonstrated that the fraction <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          r /<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> , defined as the risk ratio λ 
          r for a type-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relative</ENAMEX>, can be used
          to model the probable modes of transmission for a complex
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>. Thus, under a given model, the value of λ 
          r should decrease in a model-specific
          manner for each decreasing degree of unilineal
          relationship, and this expected value can then be
          contrasted with recurrence risks obtained from a set of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX> (monozygotic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">twins</ENAMEX>, dizygotic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">twins</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">siblings</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">offspring</ENAMEX>, second-degree <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX>, etc.). For a
          single-locus model, therefore, the value of (λ 
          r <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-1</NUMEX>) should decrease by a factor of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, and a multiplicative model predicts risk on the basis
          of the product of the individual factors.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Risch</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">63</TIMEX> ] extended the approach of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Suarez et al</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">64</NUMEX> ] to include any <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relative pair</ENAMEX>. On the basis of this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">formulation</ENAMEX>, the power to detect linkage can be obtained
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relative</ENAMEX> (sibling) pairs. For concordant sibling
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pairs</ENAMEX>, assuming that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> locus is near a stroke
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">susceptibility locus (θ > 0</ENAMEX>), power depends upon λ 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX> (sibling recurrence risk) and λ 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">o</ENAMEX> (offspring recurrence risk). If
          there is little dominance effect, then λ 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">s = λ</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">o</ENAMEX> , and hence the power can be
          computed on the basis of sibling recurrence risk. For
          other pairs of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relatives</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Risch</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">63</TIMEX> ] has shown that the
          single parameter λ 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">o</ENAMEX> is sufficient to specify power (and
          θ, if θ <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 0</NUMEX>). The recurrence risk data in relatives
          are sparse for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Framingham</ENAMEX> suggest that
          a reasonable estimate of λ 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> may range from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> to
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>.
          We assume that the genetic markers used have
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polymorphic</ENAMEX> information content (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PIC</ENAMEX>) equivalent to that
          of an equiprobable <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-allele system, yielding a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PIC of</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 70%</NUMEX>. The sample size required to determine a given
          power is inversely proportional to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PIC</ENAMEX> of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">markers</ENAMEX>; thus, a sample of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> concordant sibling pairs
          genotyped at a marker with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PIC</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70%</NUMEX> would be equivalent
          to a fully informative marker typed on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">210</NUMEX> concordant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pairs</ENAMEX>. In our consideration of power, therefore, we
          consider a marker with incomplete information, and the
          initial analyses will comprise pairwise analyses.
          Application of multipoint (interval) mapping methods will
          further increase power [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">65</TIMEX> ] . Formal analyses with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MAPMAKER/SIBS</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GeneHunter</ENAMEX> will add further power by
          means of the multipoint method. Using this approach, we
          have estimated power for a set of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300 sibling</NUMEX> pairs
          concordant for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> (equivalent to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">210</NUMEX> pairs with fully
          informative markers but without <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">parents</ENAMEX>). With these
          estimates, we should have ample power to detect linkage
          between a marker and a moderately strong susceptibility
          locus, especially for locus-specific sib risks greater
          than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>.
          For a homogeneous single disease susceptibility locus,
          the power to detect linkage with our expected <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX>
          concordant sibling pairs generally approaches <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). If stroke <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">susceptibility</ENAMEX> is attributable to several
          loci, the risk becomes dependent upon the nature of the
          contributions (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">additive</ENAMEX> or epistatic), and the loci are
          more difficult to identify. Recent efforts utilizing
          analysis of genome scan data conditional on the evidence
          for linkage of a major susceptibility factor show promise
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">66</TIMEX> ] . With <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> concordant sibling pairs, we have over
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70%</NUMEX> power to detect linkage with a genome-wide
          significance of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.00022</NUMEX> and locus-specific risk
          of λ 
          s = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.6</NUMEX>. As was demonstrated in the
          discordant sibling-pair analyses, we may have substantial
          power to detect linkage using a complementary analytic
          approach, so that the addition of even <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> discordant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">siblings</ENAMEX> to the concordant sibling pairs may provide
          additional insight on linkage.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        It is clearly of importance to define genetic risk
        factor loci for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX>. Defining such loci should
        eventually enable us to determine prospectively those who
        are at high risk for the disease and to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">counsel</ENAMEX> and treat
        them based on this knowledge: in addition, these risk
        factor loci may help in the identification of new drug
        targets for effective treatment of this prevalent disease.
        However, special safeguards must be in place to protect the
        rights of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> involved in genetic research. If genetic
        information is improperly safeguarded, misuse could
        adversely influence insurability [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">67</TIMEX> ] and employability [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">68</NUMEX> ] of subjects and could stigmatize <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> or groups
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">69</TIMEX> ] . For this study, we have adopted many of the
        practical suggestions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Merz</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">70</TIMEX> ]
        regarding the ethical use of human tissue. For linking
        purposes, we use special study-specific codes, rather than
        medical record numbers, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Social Security</ENAMEX> numbers, or an
        easily decoded combination of initials and birth dates.
        Access to linking files is restricted to an as-needed basis
        only, and the files are deleted when they are no longer
        needed. The study mandates a strictly unidirectional flow
        of information. This means that clinical data are used for
        research purposes, but research data are not used for
        clinical purposes. This restriction on the use of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SWISS</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> set is based on our recognition that unique clinical
        obligations accompany the provision of predictive genetic
        test results to individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">71</TIMEX> ] .
        Recently, there has been intense debate in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">States</ENAMEX> at the federal level over the privacy rights of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pedigree</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> with respect to genetic research. For this
        study, we have adopted the position that every <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pedigree</ENAMEX> has the right to refuse to have personal
        information such as name, address, and medical history
        recorded in a research database. This right cannot be
        waived by other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the pedigree [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">72</TIMEX> ] . Therefore,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">probands</ENAMEX> or their noninvestigator surrogates invite other
        family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> to participate. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Siblings</ENAMEX> who are interested
        in participating voluntarily provide <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> with
        their name, address, and telephone number.
        Identifying the genetic basis of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> with complex
        modes of inheritance is a daunting task, and it is likely
        that a variety of approaches will be necessary to elucidate
        the genetic basis of human <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genomics</ENAMEX> has been
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">applied</ENAMEX> to animal models of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> and yielded discoveries
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about</NUMEX> loci that correlate with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> risk. For example,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rubattu</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">73</TIMEX> ] identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> major
        quantitative trait loci in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the F2</TIMEX> cross of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX>-prone and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">spontaneously hypertensive rats</ENAMEX>. Conducting adequately
        powered genomics studies of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> is
        considerably more challenging.
        The central approach this study takes is to identify
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">areas</ENAMEX> of the genome that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">siblings</ENAMEX> affected by stroke share
        more often than one would expect by chance. The strength of
        this approach is its theoretical robustness, because the
        methods make relatively few assumptions about either the
        genetic architecture of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> in which the disease
        is studied or about the disease risk. The weaknesses of the
        approach are its <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relative</ENAMEX> lack of power and the low
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resolution</ENAMEX> of the linkage peaks identified. In addition,
        the logistical problem of obtaining <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA samples</ENAMEX> from
        clinically well-characterized <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of a cohort of stroke
        pedigrees can be a daunting task.
        Although our primary analytic methods will focus on the
        concordant pair design, we will also use a complementary
        and related approach, the discordant sibling pair method.
        This method essentially searches for areas of the genome
        that are shared less often than one would expect by chance.
        Discordant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">siblings</ENAMEX> are generally easier to collect because
        they are more frequent than concordant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">siblings</ENAMEX> in a
        disease such as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX>. As demonstrated in the case of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diabetic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nephropathy</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">74</TIMEX> ] , the discordant sibling pair
        approach can have greater power than the concordant sibling
        pair approach in certain situations. However, the
        discordant sibling pair approach is often less efficient
        than the concordant sibling method because of the
        uncertainty of the final diagnostic status of the
        unaffected sibling. Discordant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">siblings</ENAMEX> might have
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subclinical</ENAMEX> (radiographic) <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> or be discordant only
        because of their relative youth. Furthermore, resource
        limitations in this study prevent the collection of blood
        from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 1</NUMEX> discordant sibling for each concordant
        pair.
        An alternative design to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> using affected relative
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pairs</ENAMEX> is that of genome-wide <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> with
        ischemic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> (cases) ascertained without respect to
        family history compared with nonstroke controls for
        frequency of numerous, densely spaced genetic markers
        (single nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs). Although the
        cases and controls are collected more easily than
        concordant sibling pairs, this approach also has
        limitations. First, the case-control approach is not robust
        to differential environmental contribution, so that
        heterogeneity between case and control exposure could
        result in spurious <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, unlike the
        concordant sibling pair approach, controls are "unaffected"
        only at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">time</TIMEX> of collection. The control sample actually
        represents a mixture of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> who will never have an
        ischemic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> and those who will eventually have an
        ischemic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX>. Thus, true <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">associations</ENAMEX> can be missed due
        to misclassiflcation. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, the number of subjects to be
        collected to provide genome-wide significance for an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> study remains large, given the number of SNPs
        to be genotyped across the genome to provide <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 kb</TIMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> kb
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">spacing</ENAMEX>. To address the "multiple comparisons" <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> with
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNPs</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000 to 20,000</NUMEX> cases and controls
        would need to be studied.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Association</ENAMEX> studies in a case/control framework have a
        long history in stroke etiology research. However, these
        studies have been problematic because until now they have
        only allowed testing for the known <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX>, and they
        have been plagued by false positives. With the completion
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">First Draft of the Human Genome</ENAMEX>, and the
        identification of haplotype maps, it may be that this
        approach can be adapted to a whole genome association
        strategy using prudently positioned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNPs</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA samples</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">banked</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SWISS</ENAMEX>.
        Much of the theoretical challenge of finding genetic
        risk factors comes from the heterogeneity of the stroke
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenotype</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SWISS</ENAMEX> we are studying the ultimate phenotype
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ischemic stroke</ENAMEX>. An alternative approach would be to
        study an intermediate phenotype, such as carotid
        atherosclerosis, with the hope that alleles underlying this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenotype</ENAMEX> play a role in the etiology of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> itself.
        Shifting the object of investigation from ischemic stroke
        to carotid atherosclerosis would decrease the numbers of
        subjects needed. Another advantage is that carotid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">atherosclerosis</ENAMEX> can be treated as a quantitative trait.
        However, using carotid atherosclerosis as an intermediate
        phenotype for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ischemic stroke</ENAMEX> also has limitations. Perhaps
        the most important difficulty is that high-grade carotid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">atherosclerosis</ENAMEX> is not a prerequisite intermediate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phenotype</ENAMEX> in most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ischemic stroke</ENAMEX>. The
        large-artery atherosclerotic subtype of ischemic stroke
        accounted for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 13%</NUMEX> of all <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ischemic strokes</ENAMEX> in a recent
        population-based study in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bavaria</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">75</TIMEX> ] .
        Similarly, the large-artery atherosclerotic subtype
        accounted for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 16%</NUMEX> of all <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ischemic strokes</ENAMEX> in a
        population-based study in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rochester</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minnesota</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">76</TIMEX> ] . In
        addition to not being a mandatory intermediate phenotype in
        the biological process leading to ischemic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX>, carotid
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">atherosclerosis</ENAMEX> is itself a complex phenotype. Degree of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stenosis</ENAMEX> is not the only factor affecting symptomatology of
        an atherosclerotic carotid <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">artery</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">77</TIMEX> ] , and important
        differences between intracranial and cervical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">arteries</ENAMEX> in
        the genetics of atherosclerosis may go unrecognized if the
        object of study is cervical carotid atherosclerosis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">78</TIMEX> ]
        .
        Our study directly addresses the heterogeneity of the
        ischemic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke phenotype</ENAMEX> through the study-wide use of a
        standardized, validated, and widely accepted system of
        classifying ischemic strokes based on presumed etiology.
        The process of certification minimizes variation among
        local <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">center physician investigators</ENAMEX> in assigning TOAST
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke subtype</ENAMEX> to probands. The process of central
        adjudication minimizes the variation in assigning TOAST
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subtype</ENAMEX> to concordant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">siblings</ENAMEX>. Although we recognize that
        it may be of value for future studies to define concordance
        for phenotype by ischemic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke subtype</ENAMEX>, we have chosen to
        regard that approach as exploratory at this stage.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> way of dealing with the logistic challenges inherent
        in genetic studies is to collect cases from an isolated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">population</ENAMEX>, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iceland</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">79</TIMEX> ] . However this approach
        requires an integrated health care database not easily
        applicable within the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> health care model, and the
        required community consent is probably not possible within
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> legal/ethical framework [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80 81</NUMEX> ] . Logistic
        difficulties have been mitigated by the steady evolution in
        multicentered clinical trials that has occurred in the
        field of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> research [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">82</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SWISS</ENAMEX> is designed as a
        multicenter clinical trial, and the use of a nationwide
        home health <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> for phlebotomy service enables us to
        obtain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">siblings</ENAMEX> living far away from one
        another. Whereas a requirement that study subjects travel
        to a local study <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> could result in failure to enroll
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> for logistic reasons, a home health <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">agency</ENAMEX> can
        obtain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> from study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> rendered homebound by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> or other ailments. Thus, it is hoped that this study
        design will efficiently assemble a cohort of ischemic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke pedigrees</ENAMEX> without invoking community consent or
        using "cold-calling" of pedigree <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>.
        In conclusion, we believe that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA samples</ENAMEX> collected
        in this study will not only be of use in defining regions
        of the genome in which stroke genes reside. They may also
        be of use in testing for allelic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of candidate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and regions by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SNPs</ENAMEX>, because alleles that predispose
        to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> should have a higher allele frequency in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">siblings</ENAMEX> who share chromosomal regions than in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">siblings</ENAMEX> who
        do not. Because the cell lines are banked, we hope to
        facilitate the identification of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX> risk factor genes
        both directly by ourselves and by others.
