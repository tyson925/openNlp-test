        The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">retinoic acid receptors</ENAMEX> (RAR-Î±, -Î², and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">-Î³</NUMEX>) are
        transcription factors regulating a variety of endocrine
        metabolic pathways. Unlike anti-estrogens, such as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tamoxifen</ENAMEX> or raloxifene, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ligands</ENAMEX> targeted against the RAR
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">isoforms</ENAMEX> can present anticancer activity against both
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">estrogen</ENAMEX> receptor positive and negative breast tumor cells
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. As a result, such molecules could constitute a novel
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> against <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX>. For reasons not
        yet clear, both agonists and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAR</ENAMEX> can present
        anti-tumor activity against <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast</ENAMEX>, prostate, lung cancer
        or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">leukemia</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7</ENAMEX>]. The development of both
        types of ligands could therefore have important biomedical
        implications. We have recently demonstrated that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">antagonists</ENAMEX> could be discovered rationally, based on a
        model of the antagonist-bound conformation of the receptor
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>]. Our goal here is to discover innovative molecular
        structures with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAR</ENAMEX> agonist activity.
        Several retinoid and non-retinoid ligands have been
        described, which activate one or a combination of RAR
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">isoforms</ENAMEX>. Some of them, such as the natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormone</ENAMEX>
        all-trans <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">retinoic acid</ENAMEX> (all-trans <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1a), have been
        tested clinically, and display unacceptable side effects,
        such as skin dryness, cheilitis, hypertriglyceridemia and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conjunctivitis</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9, 10</ENAMEX>]. However, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">compounds</ENAMEX> tested so
        far belong to limited series of related <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX>. An
        increasing amount of data suggests that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAR</ENAMEX>-Î² isoform,
        which is under the transcriptional control of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAR</ENAMEX>-Î±, is
        involved in suppressing cell growth and tumorigenicity [
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16</TIMEX>]. Innovative molecules with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAR</ENAMEX>-Î±
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAR</ENAMEX>-Î² agonist activity could therefore present more
        favorable toxicity profile than pan-agonists.
        We applied a flexible virtual screening algorithm
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Molsoft ICM</ENAMEX>, virtual library screening module [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>]) which
        rapidly docks <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds of thousands</NUMEX> of flexible compound
        structures into the ligand binding pocket of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAR</ENAMEX>, and
        discovered <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> novel RAR-Î² selective agonists. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of these
        ligands displays original structural and chemical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">characteristics</ENAMEX>, which could be used in the development of
        novel compounds for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> prevention and therapy.
      
      
        Results and discussion
        We first built a model of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAR</ENAMEX>-Î± agonist binding
        pocket from the crystal structure of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAR</ENAMEX>-Î³ ligand
        binding domain (RAR-Î³ LBD) / all-trans <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> complex [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>].
        All but <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> in the vicinity of the ligand are
        conserved between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> isoforms. These three
        non-identical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues -A234</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">M272</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">A397</NUMEX>- were changed
        to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAR</ENAMEX>-Î± isoform <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">-S234</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">I272</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">V397</NUMEX>- and the energy
        of the system was minimized (see "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Materials</ENAMEX> and
        Methods").
        In order to address the accuracy of our model of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAR</ENAMEX>-Î± binding pocket, we docked <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Am580</TIMEX>, an RAR-Î± specific
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">agonist</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>], into the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> (the chemical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> of
        Am580 is shown <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1b). A rapid docking procedure with
        flexible ligand and a grid representation of the receptor
        was followed by an extensive <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Monte Carlo</ENAMEX> energy
        minimization with both ligand and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> side chains
        flexible (see "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Materials and Methods</ENAMEX>" for details). The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">ligand</ENAMEX> superimposed well with the natural <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormone</ENAMEX> all-trans
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2a). Interestingly, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Am580</ENAMEX> does not seem to fit in
        the receptor binding site: the ketone <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> of the ligand
        sticks out of the binding pocket, due to too close
        proximity of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue 234</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2b). However, in the complex
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAR</ENAMEX>-Î±, this ketone <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> shares an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hydrogen atom</ENAMEX> with
        the hydroxyl <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of serine <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">234</NUMEX>, and forms a stabilizing
        hydrogen bond, while a steric clash occurs in the other two
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAR</ENAMEX> isoforms, where <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue 234</ENAMEX> is an alanine.
        Consequently, our model provides a rational for Am580
        isoform specificity, suggesting that it is relevant and
        could be used as a template for the discovery of novel
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAR</ENAMEX>-Î± agonist structures.
        A high throughput virtual screening was carried out on
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Available Chemicals Directory</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MDL Information Systems</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Leandro</ENAMEX>, CA), a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">compound structure</ENAMEX> database of over
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">150,000</NUMEX> molecules. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">compound</ENAMEX> was automatically docked
        into a grid representation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAR</ENAMEX>-Î±, as previously
        described for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Am580</TIMEX>, and assigned a score according to the
        quality of the fit [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8, 17, 20</ENAMEX>]. The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5364</TIMEX> ligand candidates
        which scored better (i.e. lower) than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-32</NUMEX> kcal/mol were
        preselected for a more refined energy minimization
        procedure, with flexible receptor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">side chains</ENAMEX>, and the
        energy of complexation was predicted as previously
        described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>] (see "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Materials and Methods"</ENAMEX>). After
        careful visual examination of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> displaying
        the lowest predicted binding energy, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> molecules were
        selected and purchased to be experimentally tested 
        in vitro .
        HeLa cells were separately transfected with either of
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> wild type hRAR isoforms, and a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Î”MTV-IR-CAT</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">reporter gene</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22, 23</TIMEX>]. The cells were incubated with each
        ligand at concentrations from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 nM to 20 Î</NUMEX>¼M to stimulate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CAT</ENAMEX> activity. Possible toxicity of the compounds was
        deduced from the amount of cellular protein extract after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> of incubation. The percentage of conversion induced by
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> Î¼M all-trans <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> (RARs) or <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 Î¼M 9-</ENAMEX>cis <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RXR-Î²</ENAMEX>) was used
        as a positive control to determine the maximum induction.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3shows <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">all-trans RA</ENAMEX> induced conversion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAR</ENAMEX>-Î± as a
        function of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> concentration. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAR</ENAMEX>-Î² could induce <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> of
        the maximum <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CAT</ENAMEX> activity when activated by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> nM agonist 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> (chemical structure shown <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1c),
        while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAR</ENAMEX>-Î³ was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 12%</NUMEX> active and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAR</ENAMEX>-Î± not active at all
        under the same conditions (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). At <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> nM of agonist 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAR</ENAMEX>-Î² was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> active, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAR</ENAMEX>-Î³ <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAR</ENAMEX>-Î± <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5%</NUMEX> active. Similarly, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAR</ENAMEX>-Î² could induce <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">22%</NUMEX> of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">maximum CAT</ENAMEX> activity when activated by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> nM agonist 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> (chemical structure shown <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1d).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAR</ENAMEX>-Î± and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAR</ENAMEX>-Î³ were <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10% and 14%</NUMEX> active at the same
        concentration of agonist, respectively. At <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> nM of
        agonist 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAR</ENAMEX>-Î² displayed <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">48%</NUMEX> of its maximal
        activity, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAR</ENAMEX>-Î± <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40%</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAR</ENAMEX>-Î³ <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">17%</NUMEX>. At <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 Î¼M</NUMEX>, agonist 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> induced full activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAR</ENAMEX>-Î² and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAR</ENAMEX>-Î³, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX> activation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAR</ENAMEX>-Î±, showing that this
        compound is a full agonist. Agonist 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> was toxic for the cells at <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 Î¼M</NUMEX>, as
        shown by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> content of cell culture dishes, which is
        why little transcriptional activity was observed at this
        concentration. However, little or no toxicity was observed
        at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> Î¼M, a concentration at which agonist 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> induced <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 50%</NUMEX> maximal activity of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAR</ENAMEX>-Î± and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAR</ENAMEX>-Î², and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35%</NUMEX> maximal activity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAR-Î³.</ENAMEX> Agonist
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> was not toxic at <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 Î¼M</NUMEX>. Finally, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RXR</ENAMEX>-Î² was activated only
        weakly by both agonists 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> Î¼M, but was significantly
        activated by agonist <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">20 Î¼M</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). Comparison of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Figs.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3and 4also</ENAMEX> shows that at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> nM of agonists 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAR</ENAMEX>-Î² exhibits the same activity as
        the positive control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAR</ENAMEX>-Î± induced by all-trans <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX> at the
        same concentration.
        The predicted structure of the complex generated by the
        virtual screening approach, and further optimized with
        flexible receptor side-chains details clearly the
        interactions between the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> and the ligands (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>).
        Agonist 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> both have a carboxylate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> which
        superimposes with the carboxylate of all-trans <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RA</ENAMEX>, and
        makes stabilizing hydrogen bonds with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arg</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">274 and 278</NUMEX>, and
        the backbone nitrogen of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Ser 289</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). All other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">receptor/ligand</ENAMEX> interactions are hydrophobic. As a result,
        the size and flexibility of the ligand as well as the shape
        complementarity with the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> are critical for affinity
        and specificity.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> of agonist 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2</ENAMEX> is almost similar to that of Ch55
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1e), another RAR-Î² selective <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agonist</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>] with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.44</NUMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.04 and 1.7 nM</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Kd</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">RAR-Î±, RAR-Î² and RAR</ENAMEX>-Î³ respectively
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>]. However, agonist 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2</ENAMEX> has an additional hydroxyl <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> on
        the aromatic ring. The observation that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Ch55</ENAMEX> displays some
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">potency</ENAMEX> against the growth of human non-small cell lung
        carcinoma cells [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>] as well as anti-angiogenic activity [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX>] suggests that agonist 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2</ENAMEX> is a good lead <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> for cancer
        therapy. Since this <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">compound</ENAMEX> was discovered through a
        single virtual library screening, this is a very
        encouraging result which also constitutes a validation of
        our method.
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> of agonist 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1</ENAMEX> is entirely novel; it is the first
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ligand</ENAMEX> described so far with either a thiazole ring or
        a trifluoro <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. It presents a very limited level of
        flexibility and fits tightly into the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>'s binding
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pocket</ENAMEX>. This compound illustrates the benefits of the 
        in silico screening procedure, a
        rational approach which is based solely on the structure of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>, and is not biased towards existing ligands.
        Indeed, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> design usually derives novel
        compound <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> from ligands previously described. Our
        approach enabled the discovery 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ab</ENAMEX> initio of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAR</ENAMEX> agonists displaying
        some activity at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> nM with a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7%</NUMEX> success rate.
        The specificity profile of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ligands</ENAMEX> described
        here are similar to that of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Ch55</TIMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">compound</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> times
        higher affinity for RAR-Î² than RAR-Î±, and which can block
        the growth of certain <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> types [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>]. It will be
        interesting to test these molecules for anti-proliferative
        activity, both 
        in vitro and 
        in vivo . The observation that
        agonist 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1</ENAMEX> does not belong to any of the series
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ligands</ENAMEX> described so far makes this compound
        particularly interesting for further development.
        While a model of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAR</ENAMEX>-Î± was used to conduct the virtual
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">screening</ENAMEX>, agonists 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> and 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> have an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> nM for RAR-Î²,
        and an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 and 2</NUMEX> Î¼M respectively for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAR-Î±.</ENAMEX> This
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">observation</ENAMEX> emphasizes the primary goal of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX>-based
        screening procedures, which is to significantly accelerate
        the initial steps of lead identification projects by
        automatically discriminating between binders and
        non-binders, rather than ranking ligands according to their
        affinity for the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>. The discovery of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> RAR-Î±
        agonists out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> molecules tested is a good illustration
        of this approach.
      
      
        Conclusions
        This report details the rapid discovery of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAR</ENAMEX> agonists
        with novel structural features, thanks to a powerful
        virtual ligand screening approach, and a research strategy
        where considerations on existing ligands are avoided. One
        of the molecules presented here constitute a good framework
        for the development of a novel series of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAR</ENAMEX> ligands very
        different from all structures described so far. Such
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ligands</ENAMEX> could present more favorable specificity and
        toxicity profiles, and have important applications in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> therapy.

          The flexible ligand was docked into a combination of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> potential map representations of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAR</ENAMEX>-Î± ligand
          binding pocket, which account for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Van</ENAMEX> der Waals
          boundaries, hydrophobicity, electrostatics and hydrogen
          bonding profiles [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20, 27</TIMEX>]. This rapid docking procedure
          was followed by a more refined energy minimization of the
          complex, with a full atom representation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>,
          and flexible receptor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">side chains</ENAMEX>, according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICM</ENAMEX>
          stochastic global optimization algorithm [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26, 27</TIMEX>] as
          implemented in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Molsoft ICM</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.7</NUMEX> program [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>].
        
        
          Virtual screening of the compound structure
          database
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICM</ENAMEX> program [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>] was used to perform both
          receptor modeling and virtual ligand screening. The
          procedure followed was similar than previously described
          [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>]: each flexible ligand of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Available Chemicals</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Directory</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MDL Information Systems</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Leandro</ENAMEX>) was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">docked</ENAMEX> automatically into the combination of potential
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">maps</ENAMEX> described above, and assigned a score according to
          its fit with the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>. The scoring function included
          continuum as well as discreet electrostatics,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hydrophobicity</ENAMEX> and entropy parameters [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>]. The
          screening of the database of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 150,000</NUMEX> ligands took
          less than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a month</TIMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> "<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">194 MHZ</NUMEX> IP25" processors. Using
          the same computing power, the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5364</TIMEX> compounds which scored
          better (i.e. lower) than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-32</NUMEX> were preselected for a
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> automatic round of selection: they were all docked
          in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two days</TIMEX> into a full atom representation of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>, with flexible receptor <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">side chains</ENAMEX>, according
          to a global energy optimization in internal coordinates [
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17, 26, 27, 28</TIMEX>]. The <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> generated by the initial
          library screening was used as a starting point for this
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>, more refined, docking procedure. The binding
          energy of the compounds was then evaluated with a
          boundary elements implementation of solvation
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electrostatics</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>] and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> compounds showing the
          lowest binding energy were selected for further
          examination. After careful visual inspection for shape
          complementarity, hydrogen bonding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">network</ENAMEX>, compound
          flexibility, and potential <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Van der Waals</ENAMEX> clashes, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>
          molecules out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> were selected and purchased to be
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">experimentally</ENAMEX> tested 
          in vitro . We should stress out
          here that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Van der Waals</ENAMEX> term is too noisy to be added
          to the binding energy function, as discussed in details
          elsewhere [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>]. As a consequence, some compounds with a
          low predicted binding energy were not retained, because
          they seemed likely to clash sterically with the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Biological activity of the ligand candidates
          HeLa cells were transfected by calcium phosphate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">precipitation</ENAMEX> using <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 Î¼g</NUMEX> of plasmid expressing the full
          length <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor isoform</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 Î¼g</NUMEX> of a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Î”MTV-IR-CAT</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> gene, as previously described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22, 23</TIMEX>]. Ligands
          were dissolved in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMSO</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> mM final concentration. Cell
          cultures were supplemented with indicated ligands
          immediately after addition of the calcium phosphate/DNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">precipitate</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Media</ENAMEX> and ligands were replaced after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> h
          and cells were harvested and assayed for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CAT</ENAMEX> activity <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">h</ENAMEX> later: acetylated and unreacted [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14C</TIMEX>] chloramphenicol
          was excised from a thin layer chromatography plate and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">quantitated</ENAMEX> in a liquid scintillation counter. The amount
          of cellular protein extract after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two days</TIMEX> of incubation
          was measured to determine the compounds toxicity. Agonist
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> was purchased from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bionet Research</ENAMEX> (catalog number
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1G-433S</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Agonist 2</ENAMEX> was purchased from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma-Aldrich</ENAMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma Aldrich</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> of rare <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chemicals</ENAMEX>. Catalog number
