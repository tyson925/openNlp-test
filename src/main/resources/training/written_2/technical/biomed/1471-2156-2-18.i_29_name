        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Glaucoma</ENAMEX> is a leading cause of blindness that involves
        loss of retinal ganglion cells and degeneration of the
        optic nerve [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Glaucoma</ENAMEX> is usually associated with
        high intraocular pressure (IOP) that results from an
        increased resistance to drainage of the ocular fluid [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ]
        . Developmental disorders of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">ocular anterior segment</ENAMEX>,
        including <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Axenfeld-Rieger</ENAMEX> syndrome, are often associated
        with elevated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> and glaucoma [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] . The developmental
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX> and structure of the human and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> ocular
        drainage <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> are similar [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] , and the same genes
        are known to cause anterior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> dysgenesis (ASD) in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. Known genes that cause anterior segment
        dysgenesis code for developmentally important transcription
        factors. These <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> include 
        PITX2, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PITX3</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">PAX6</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">FOXC1</TIMEX> (previously
        known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">FKHL7</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">FREAC3</ENAMEX>), 
        Foxc2 and 
        FOXE3 [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5 6 7 8 9</NUMEX> ] . Activity
        levels for these transcription factors normally associated
        with diploid gene dosage are important for normal ocular
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>, with heterozygosity for null mutations in most
        of these genes causing anterior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> dysgenesis. For 
        FOXC1 and 
        PAX6, both haploinsufficiency and
        increased gene dosage due to gene duplication result in
        abnormal ocular development [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11 12 13</NUMEX> ] . Similarly, a
        mutation in 
        PITX2 that results in increased
        transcriptional transactivation causes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ASD</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bone morphogenetic proteins</ENAMEX> (BMPs) are a large subclass
        (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>) of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGF</ENAMEX>-β superfamily. Although
        originally named because of their ability to induce bone
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cartilage</ENAMEX> formation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMPs</ENAMEX> are involved in many
        developmental processes, including cell proliferation and
        differentiation, apoptosis, and intercellular interactions
        during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">morphogenesis</TIMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25</NUMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bone morphogenetic protein</ENAMEX> family function
        in a gene dosage dependent manner during development and
        participate in ocular development [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 27 28 29</NUMEX> ] .
        Therefore, mutations that alter the level of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMPs</ENAMEX> or alter
        the degree of BMP signaling are <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> to contribute to
        Axenfeld-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rieger</ENAMEX> syndrome and other conditions involving
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">anterior</ENAMEX> segment malformation, elevated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX>, and glaucoma.
        Interestingly, some BMPs modulate tooth morphogenesis [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>
        ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Axenfeld-Rieger</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> present with dental
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">abnormalities</ENAMEX>.
        
        Bmp2 and 
        Bmp4 are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the BMP
        family, closely related to 
        Drosophila dpp (decapentaplegic). 
        Bmp4 is expressed in multiple tissues
        during embryonic development, including the heart, lung,
        kidney, brain, and eye [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 24</NUMEX> ] . In the eye, 
        Bmp4 expression is first identified
        in the distal optic vesicle and overlying surface ectoderm
        at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">8-12</ENAMEX> somite stage and later in the dorsal portion of
        the developing optic cup [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Lens</ENAMEX> induction is absent
        in homozygous 
        Bmp4 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mutants</ENAMEX> and can be rescued by
        exogenous <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BMP4 protein</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] .
        The effects of decreasing 
        Bmp4 dosage on anterior and posterior
        segment development have not been reported. In this study,
        we analyzed <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> heterozygous for a null allele of 
        Bmp4 ( 
        Bmp4 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tmlBlh</ENAMEX> ) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] to determine if
        decreased functional gene dosage contributes to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ASD</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">elevated IOP</ENAMEX>. Heterozygous 
        Bmp4 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mutant mice</ENAMEX> have a variety of
        ocular abnormalities including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ASD</ENAMEX>, buphthalmia (enlarged
        eyes), and elevated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX>. This work functionally
        demonstrates that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP4</ENAMEX> is a good <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> to cause human
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ASD</ENAMEX> and developmental glaucoma.

          Bmp4expression
          Eyes of 
          Bmp4 
          lacZneo heterozygotes on a mixed
          background [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] were evaluated for β-galactosidase
          expression at embryonic ages E14<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.5</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E16.5</ENAMEX>, new born,
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">postnatal ages P2</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P14</TIMEX>, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P30</TIMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Expression
          was found in iris, ciliary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">retinal pigment</ENAMEX>
          epithelium at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">E14.5</NUMEX> and became more intense after birth.
          Expression continued at the same level at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P30</TIMEX>. Expression
          was also demonstrated in the endothelial cells of
          conjunctiva, retina, and orbit. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Importantly</ENAMEX>, expression
          was not present in the developing trabecular meshwork and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schlemm</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canal</ENAMEX> (ocular drainage structures) or in
          hyaloid vascular endothelial cells. All other studies
          described in the following sections were carried out on
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> with the 
          Bmp4 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">tmlBlh</ENAMEX> targeted mutation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ]
          (hereafter, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Bmp4 +/-</ENAMEX>), and are based on 
          Bmp4 +/+and 
          Bmp4 +/-<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. Unless otherwise
          stated, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> had a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C57BL/6J</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">B6</NUMEX>) genetic
          background.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anterior</ENAMEX> segment dysgenesis
          Slit lamp examination revealed a variety of anterior
          segment abnormalities in 
          Bmp4 +/-but not in 
          Bmp4 +/+<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> (normal littermates)
          that were <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 to 5 months of age</TIMEX>. The specific phenotype
          varied from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> and eye to eye (Figure
          2A,B,C). Some affected eyes were relatively normal with
          only an irregularly shaped <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pupil</ENAMEX>. Most commonly, however,
          there were abnormal iridocorneal attachments (anterior
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">synechiae</ENAMEX>) of variable extent, large irregularly shaped
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pupils</ENAMEX> that were often eccentrically located, and a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">displaced Schwalbe</ENAMEX>'s line. Several eyes had peripheral
          corneal thinning while others demonstrated scleralization
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">opacity</NUMEX>) of the peripheral cornea, diffuse corneal haze,
          or peripheral neovascularization (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2C</NUMEX>). A few <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>
          had <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">anterior subcapsular cataracts</ENAMEX>.
          Histological examination focused on the most severely
          affected B6 background, and confirmed and extended the
          clinical observations. Abnormalities were only detected
          in 
          Bmp4 +/-<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. The severity of
          lesions varied within individual eyes and between eyes of
          the same <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX>. In most eyes, the iridocorneal angle was
          abnormal. The iridocorneal angle contains the ocular
          drainage <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> (trabecular meshwork and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schlemm</ENAMEX>'s
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">canal</ENAMEX>) and is located at the junction of the iris and
          cornea. Abnormalities of the iridocorneal angle included
          small or absent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schlemm</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">canal</ENAMEX> (SC), hypoplastic or
          absent trabecular meshwork (TM) that appeared compressed
          and stalled in development, and iris attachments to the
          peripheral cornea (synechiae. Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2D</TIMEX>,E,<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>). Despite the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">synechiae</ENAMEX> and abnormal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pupils</ENAMEX>, most 
          Bmp4 +/-<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> had generally normal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">iris</ENAMEX> architecture. The iris in some eyes, however, was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypoplastic</ENAMEX> and malformed (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2F</NUMEX>), and occasionally
          the malformation was extensive involving both iris and
          ciliary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>. The peripheral cornea was often thinner
          than normal with neovascularization. There was abnormal
          persistence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">anterior hyaloid vessels</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2F</NUMEX>).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anterior</ENAMEX> subcapsular and cortical cataracts occurred in
          most <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>.
          To investigate the consequences of functionally
          halving 
          Bmp4 gene dosage on iridocorneal
          angle development in more detail, we used transmission
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electron</ENAMEX> microscopy. In 
          Bmp4 +/+<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TM</ENAMEX> consisted of
          robust trabecular beams with abundant organized collagen
          and elastic tissue cores that were covered with
          endothelial-like trabecular cells. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SC</ENAMEX> had a normal
          appearance and was lined with endothelial cells. In
          contrast, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SC</ENAMEX> was often absent and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TM</ENAMEX> had developed
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">abnormally</ENAMEX> or was absent in 
          Bmp4 +/-<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. Even in places where
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TM</ENAMEX> was relatively normal, there were fewer trabecular
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">beams</ENAMEX> and a paucity of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">extracellular matrix</ENAMEX> (ECM)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">components</ENAMEX>, including organized collagen bundles and
          elastic tissue. For example, in the posterior trabecular
          meshwork of wild <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">type mice</ENAMEX>, there are normally <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7-10</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">trabecular</ENAMEX> beams [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] , but 
          Bmp4 +/-<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> had only <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> beams and
          these beams were nearly devoid of collagen (Figure
          2G,H,I,<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">J</ENAMEX>). Further <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECM</ENAMEX> abnormalities were present in the
          peripheral cornea where prominent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">irregularity</ENAMEX> of the
          normally regularly arranged collagen bundles explained
          the peripheral corneal scleralization.
        
        
          Intraocular pressure
          To determine the effects of decreased 
          Bmp4 gene dosage on intraocular
          pressure, we compared the lOPs of age- and strain-matched
          
          Bmp4 +/-and 
          Bmp4 +/+<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. We initially assessed
          the lOPs of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 to 5 month</TIMEX> old <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. At these ages, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> out
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> 
          Bmp4 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">+/-heterozygotes</ENAMEX> had elevated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> (defined as an IOP greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> standard
          deviations above the mean of the 
          Bmp4 +/+<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>). To determine if the
          incidence of elevated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> changed with age, we analyzed
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the ages of 6 to 10 months</TIMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 to 16</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX>. The incidence did not change appreciably with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>
          out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> having elevated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6 to 10 months</TIMEX> and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> having elevated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12 to 16 months</TIMEX> (Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). 
          Bmp4 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genotype</ENAMEX> had a significant
          effect on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANOVA</ENAMEX>, P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.004</NUMEX>) whereas age and sex
          did not.
          Due to the variability in both anterior segment
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">abnormalities</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX>, we reasoned that histological
          analysis of eyes with high versus normal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> might
          provide insight to the extent of abnormalities required
          to cause elevated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX>. The incidence of drainage
          structure abnormalities and synechiae deemed severe
          enough to significantly decrease or prevent aqueous humor
          drainage was recorded by careful analysis of many
          sections from different regions around these eyes (see
          Methods). Our data suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> is normal even when
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> of the iridocorneal angle around the circumference of
          the eye is severely abnormal. Furthermore, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all four</NUMEX> of
          the studied eyes with high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> also had severe
          abnormalities extending <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">over 80%</NUMEX> or more of the analyzed
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sections</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Posterior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> abnormalities
          Ophthalmoscopic analysis of 
          Bmp4 +/-but not 
          Bmp4 +/+<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> revealed irregular
          white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patches</ENAMEX> in the vitreous and dense vitreous haze in
          the majority of eyes examined (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4A</NUMEX>). The retinal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vasculature</ENAMEX> also was abnormal in 
          Bmp4 +/-eyes. Fluorescein
          angiography showed that the main retinal vessels branched
          close to the optic nerve and were irregularly arranged
          compared to wild <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">type mice</ENAMEX>. In addition, there was a
          dense network of small tortuous vessels throughout the
          vitreous that leaked fluorescein (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4C</NUMEX>). These
          abnormalities were identified in the youngest (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 to 3</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks old</TIMEX>) and oldest (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17 months</TIMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> examined. Severe
          retinal detachments were observed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">as early as four months</TIMEX>
          and their incidence increased with age. Although anterior
          segment cloudiness often made ophthalmoscopy difficult in
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Bmp4 +/-heterozygotes,</ENAMEX>
          abnormalities of the optic nerve <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> were frequently
          present. Combined intraorbital and intracranial
          dissection of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> randomly selected <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> failed to detect a
          grossly visible optic nerve in all but one mouse. This
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> had a nerve extending from the right eye but the
          left nerve was absent. Most dissected eyes had a small
          white <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nub</ENAMEX> of tissue over the scleral foramen.
          Histologic analysis confirmed posterior segment
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">abnormalities</ENAMEX> in 
          Bmp4 +/-heterozygotes but not in
          genotypically normal <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. In 
          Bmp4 +/+<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> the hyaloid vessels
          disappeared around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P30</TIMEX>, as reported elsewhere [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33 34</NUMEX> ] .
          In contrast, the hyaloid <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX> in 
          Bmp4 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">+/-heterozygotes</ENAMEX> persisted
          throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 17 month</TIMEX> period studied and increased in
          number and size beyond that normally present at birth
          (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4D</TIMEX>,E,<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>). The abnormal vitreous <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX> (Figure
          4Eand <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">4G</ENAMEX>) were frequently associated with the formation
          of adhesions between the retina and lens capsule that
          exerted traction on the retina resulting in retinal
          detachment in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 25%</NUMEX> of the 
          Bmp4 +/-<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> examined and occurred
          as <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early as P30</TIMEX>. Regression of the hyaloid vasculature is
          mediated via macrophage-dependent cell death [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] . In
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ten days</TIMEX> after birth, macrophages were abundant
          in the vitreous of 
          Bmp4 +/+<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, usually localized
          close to the hyaloid vascular system (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4F</NUMEX>). As the
          hyaloid <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX> disappeared the number of macrophages
          declined. In 
          Bmp4 +/-<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, macrophages were
          rarely observed and never identified in the vitreous of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> older than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P14</TIMEX>.
          In agreement with the clinical examinations, optic
          nerve <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">phenotypes</ENAMEX> in 
          Bmp4 +/-<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> ranged from normal to
          absent (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4H</TIMEX>,I,<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">J</ENAMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX>). They were often severely
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">abnormal</ENAMEX>, consisting of loose connective tissue, with
          absence of neural tissue (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4I</TIMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">J</ENAMEX>). Retinal
          architecture also varied within and between eyes.
          Although areas of retina were morphologically normal in 
          Bmp4 +/-<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, the retinal ganglion
          cell layer was estimated to on average contain
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 50%</NUMEX> the normal number of cells and the
          inner nuclear layer was unusually thin. The retinal
          phenotype was variable but present in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> of all
          analyzed ages including <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 month old</TIMEX>. It did not correlate
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX>, being present in both high and normal IOP eyes,
          and was not obviously worse in old <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> than in young
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. In contrast, the photoreceptor layer typically
          appeared normal though there may have been reduced
          numbers of cells (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4K</NUMEX>). However, there were foci of
          retinal dysplasia, characterized by <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">rosette</ENAMEX> formation
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4M</NUMEX>). Additionally, there were small areas where
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">photoreceptor</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">nuclei</ENAMEX> extended externally and were in
          direct contact with the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">retinal pigment</ENAMEX> epithelium
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4N</NUMEX>). A panel of retinal cell markers revealed
          that all major retinal cell types including ganglion
          cells, horizontal cells, bipolar cells, amacrine cells,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rod</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cone photoreceptors</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Muller</ENAMEX> cells were
          present in 
          Bmp4 +/-retinas, and expressed
          markers of differentiation (Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5A</TIMEX>,B,C,D,E,<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          Electroretinography
          We used full field electroretinography (ERG) to study
          retinal function in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Bmp4 +/-heterozygotes.</ENAMEX> Eyes with
          extensively opaque corneas or obvious cataracts were not
          used for ERG assessment, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> with retinal
          detachments were dropped from the study. There was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variability</ENAMEX> in both severity and age of detectable
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">abnormalities</ENAMEX>. Compared to normal <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, some 
          Bmp4 +/-eyes had normal responses
          even at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ages up to 15 months</TIMEX> (the oldest age assessed for
          these eyes). In other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, both 
          a - and 
          b - wave amplitude reductions were
          seen, due in part to poor pupillary dilation. However, a
          prominent feature of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERG</ENAMEX> waveforms to bright flashes
          when detectable abnormalities were present was the
          preferential loss of 
          b -wave relative to the 
          a -wave. It is well established
          that the 
          a - and 
          b - wave components of the bright
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">flash ERG</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> reflect the functional <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX> of outer-
          and inner- retinal cells, respectively. Our observations
          of greater deficits of the 
          b -wave extend our analysis to the
          entire retina and are consistent with the histologic
          abnormalities that are more severe in the inner
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">retina</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Effects of genetic background
          The penetrance and severity of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">anterior</ENAMEX> and posterior
          segment phenotypes was strongly influenced by genetic
          background (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the B6</TIMEX> background, both the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">anterior</ENAMEX> and posterior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> were abnormal in most 
          Bmp4 +/-<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over two thirds</NUMEX>
          having bilateral clinical involvement. In contrast, on
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the C3H</TIMEX>.BLiA background, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately half</NUMEX> of the 
          Bmp4 +/-<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were clinically
          affected and this was always unilateral. On this
          background, the abnormalities were typically limited to
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">anterior segment</ENAMEX> (involving enlarged <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pupils</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">buphthalmos</ENAMEX>). On other genetic backgrounds, few, if any,
          heterozygous <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> had clinically detectable ocular
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dysgenesis</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anterior</ENAMEX> segment dysgenesis
          We provide evidence here that a null mutation of 
          Bmp4 results in dominantly
          inherited developmental dysgenesis of the anterior
          segment. The abnormalities affect a variety of anterior
          segment tissues including the drainage structures of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">iridocorneal</ENAMEX> angle and are similar to those reported in
          human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ASD</ENAMEX> and glaucoma [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36 37 38</NUMEX> ] . The
          absence of detectable 
          Bmp4 expression in the drainage
          structures suggests that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BMP4</ENAMEX> produced by the ciliary
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">body</ENAMEX> and/or iris may act as a growth and differentiation
          factor during angle development. The drainage structures
          were often hypoplastic with little <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">extracellular matrix</ENAMEX>.
          The defects in 
          Bmp4 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mutant mice</ENAMEX> may involve
          abnormal cell-cell adhesion, cell migration, and/or
          delayed or abnormal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">differentiation</ENAMEX> of mesenchymal cells
          in the iridocorneal angle, including decreased production
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECM</ENAMEX>. All of these processes can be regulated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECM</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39 40 41</NUMEX> ] raising the possibility that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMP4</ENAMEX> regulates
          the production and/or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECM</ENAMEX>, and that the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECM</ENAMEX> abnormalities lead to or exacerbate the developmental
          defects. Alternatively, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BMP4</TIMEX> may direct expression of
          cell surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> that participate in cell-cell and
          cell-matrix interactions affecting both cell migration
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECM</ENAMEX> composition and/or affecting cell fate.
          The nature and variability of anterior segment
          phenotypes of 
          Bmp4 +/-heterozygotes resemble
          those we reported in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> with dominant mutations in the
          forkhead box genes 
          Foxc1 and 
          Foxc2 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ] . However, the 
          Bmp4 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">haploinsufficient</ENAMEX> phenotype is
          typically more severe. The phenotypic variability both
          between and within the eyes of genetically uniform <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>
          with 
          Bmp4 or 
          Foxc gene mutations indicates that
          stochastic developmental events are important in
          determining the phenotypic outcome. The possible nature
          of these stochastic events was previously discussed [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42</NUMEX>
          ] .
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Elevated intraocular</ENAMEX> pressure is caused by
          extensive angle dysgenesis
          In <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ASD</ENAMEX>, the phenotype is variable even
          between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with mutations in the same gene, and the
          severity of clinically observable dysgenesis does not
          correlate with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX>. The etiology of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> elevation is not
          well defined. Different 
          Bmp4 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">heterozygotes</ENAMEX> had high, low or
          normal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX>. Although 
          Bmp4 +/-eyes of each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> had
          some degree of drainage structure abnormalities, only
          eyes with severe drainage structure abnormalities
          extending over <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80%</NUMEX> or greater of the analyzed locations
          had high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX>. The requirement for extensive iridocorneal
          angle damage for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elevation</ENAMEX> agrees closely with
          independent estimates from studies of human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
          angle recession [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43 44</NUMEX> ] . Ocular trauma can damage the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">iris</ENAMEX> and drainage <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> in the angle in a manner
          that is clinically obvious since the iris tissue recedes
          posteriorly from its normal position. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> in whom
          the angle recession extends for <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">240 to 360 degrees</NUMEX> of the
          angle circumference (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">67 to 100%</NUMEX>) frequently develop
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">elevated IOP</ENAMEX> and glaucoma whereas <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with less
          extensive damage typically do not have high <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX>, although
          their risk of progressing to glaucoma is increased. The
          major difference in most 
          Bmp4 +/-eyes with low IOP was the
          presence of severe dysgenesis of the ciliary body that
          was likely to severely decrease aqueous humor production.
          Less obvious abnormalities in ciliary body tissues may
          also affect <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> by altering the volume or composition of
          the aqueous humor produced and possibly by altering the
          drainage <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> in a paracrine fashion [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ] . Thus,
          more subtle metabolic abnormalities in the ciliary body
          may interact with the iridocorneal angle phenotypic
          variation and contribute to variability in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX> elevation
          between human <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Bmp4affects retinal vascular development and
          hyaloid vascular involution
          
          Bmp4 +/-heterozygotes have
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">abnormally</ENAMEX> arranged retinal blood vessels and abnormal
          persistence of the hyaloid vasculature. In wild type
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>, the absolute number of hyaloid <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX> actively
          decreases between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P4 and P10</TIMEX> and all vessels disappear by
          P30. Elimination of the hyaloid vessels proceeds by
          programmed cell death in both human [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX> ] and mouse eyes
          [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33 35</NUMEX> ] . Furthermore, this death of endothelial cells
          and pericytes does not occur in the absence of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">macrophages</ENAMEX>. If macrophages are eliminated with toxic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">liposomes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] or in transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> expressing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">diphtheria toxin</ENAMEX> from a macrophage specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">transgene</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46</NUMEX> ] , there is persistence of the pupillary and hyaloid
          vessels. The failure of capillary regression in the
          liposome-treated <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> can be "rescued" by anterior
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">chamber</ENAMEX> injection of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">exogenous bone marrow-</ENAMEX>derived
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">macrophages</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] . In agreement with these findings, we
          observed that absence of macrophages in the vitreous of 
          Bmp4 +/-<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> is associated with
          persistence of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vessels</ENAMEX>. Additional studies are
          needed to determine how BMP4 affects the presence of the
          ocular macrophages required for vascular involution and
          if BMP4 affects the production of trophic factors or
          affects the macrophages themselves.
        
        
          BMP4 has important roles in retinal and optic nerve
          formation
          Vertebrate retinal development is an intricate process
          involving complex pathways that are not completely
          understood [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47 48 49 50 51 52 53</NUMEX> ] . Although our cell
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">marker</ENAMEX> analysis indicates that all major retinal cell
          types differentiate, haploinsufficiency of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BMP4</TIMEX> results
          in a variety of retinal abnormalities. The inner retina
          is the most severely affected with substantially reduced
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">cell</ENAMEX> numbers in both the retinal ganglion cell layer and
          inner nuclear layer of nearly all 
          Bmp4 +/-<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> on the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">B6</NUMEX> genetic
          background. Although elevated IOP likely results in inner
          retinal cell death in glaucoma, deficiency of inner
          retinal cells in 
          Bmp4 +/-heterozygotes is at least
          partly a developmental phenomenon. It does not correlate
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IOP</ENAMEX>, being present in both high and normal IOP eyes.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Cell</ENAMEX> numbers are reduced even in eyes of very young <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>,
          and the phenotype is not obviously worse in old <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>.
          Pressure induced cell death may occur, but the wide
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variability</ENAMEX> in severity between eyes may have hidden an
          effect of high IOP on cell survival.
          The optic nerve did not develop normally and appeared
          to completely lack neural tissue in most B6 
          Bmp4 +/-<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. The nerve fiber
          layer, composed of retinal ganglion cell axons was not
          evident even adjacent to the scleral foramen where it is
          normally substantially thickened due to axon convergence
          on the optic nerve. Further experiments are necessary to
          determine if <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP4</ENAMEX> modulates retinal ganglion cell axon
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sprouting</ENAMEX>, elongation, targeting or maintenance, or if
          BMP4 regulates events in optic nerve glia that affect
          these processes. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMPs</ENAMEX> have been implicated in neuronal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">maturation</ENAMEX> and axonal targeting. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Exogenous</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP7</ENAMEX> enhances
          dendrite but not axon growth in embryonic rat sympathetic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neurons</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">54</TIMEX> ] and hippocampal neurons [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">55</TIMEX> ] .
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Overexpression</ENAMEX> studies suggest a link between 
          Bmp4 and axonal targeting of
          ganglion cells. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ectopic</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BMP4</ENAMEX> can lead to the upregulation
          of 
          Tbx5 in the retina, and 
          Tbx5 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">misexpression</TIMEX> results in
          altered retinal ganglion cell axon projections to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tectum</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">56</TIMEX> ] .
          In contrast to the inner retinal layers, the
          photoreceptor layer typically appeared normal. At some
          locations, however, there was retinal dysplasia or
          disorganization of photoreceptor position. Retinal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dysplasia</ENAMEX> is characterized by palisading outer retinal
          cells that surround a central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">lumen</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">57</TIMEX> ] . It occurs in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> with a variety of genetic defects and in some
          instances is associated with abnormalities of the retinal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pigment epithelium</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">58 59 60 61 62</NUMEX> ] . Both during
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX> and in adult life, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">retinal pigment</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">epithelium</ENAMEX> is critical to retinal function [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">63</TIMEX> ] . BMP2
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> may act as negative growth <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">retinal pigment epithelium</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">64</TIMEX> ] . It is possible that
          haploinsufficiency of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BMP4</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">retinal pigment</ENAMEX>
          epithelium may be responsible for focal retinal dysplasia
          and displacement of photoreceptor nuclei.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Modifiers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidate</ENAMEX> genes
          As shown here, haploinsufficiency of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">BMP4</NUMEX> causes a
          variety of ocular abnormalities that are strongly
          influenced by strain-specific modifier <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>.
          Identification of the genetic modifiers that alter these
          phenotypes may provide an important route to
          understanding the cellular and genetic interactions
          underlying various <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">developmental</ENAMEX> processes involving
          BMP4.
          BMPs interact with target cells through a heteromeric
          complex of type I and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">type II transmembrane</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX>,
          coupled to an intracellular downstream <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pathway</ENAMEX> that
          includes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smad</ENAMEX> transcription factors. The activity of this
          BMP signaling pathway can be modulated 
          in vivo by several different
          mechanisms. For example, in the extracellular environment
          numerous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX> can bind to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BMPs</ENAMEX> and inhibit their
          interaction with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> (e.g. noggin, chordin, twisted
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gastrulation</ENAMEX>), while dominant negative receptor molecules
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">e.g. Bambi</ENAMEX>) and inhibitory <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smads</ENAMEX> (e.g. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Smad</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 and 7</NUMEX>)
          interfere with signaling at the cellular level [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">65 66</NUMEX> ] . These evolutionarily conserved factors work
          together to precisely modulate the level of BMP signaling
          activity 
          in vivo. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> encoding these
          factors are excellent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> to modify the phenotypes
          described here and to cause developmental conditions that
          associate with glaucoma.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        Wild-type levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BMP4</ENAMEX> are important for normal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development of the anterior</ENAMEX> and posterior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segments</ENAMEX>. The
        importance of BMP4 depends on genetic background. The
        ocular phenotypes of 
        Bmp4 <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mutant mice</ENAMEX> show that 
        BMP4 is a strong candidate to
        contribute to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Axenfeld-Rieger</ENAMEX> anomaly and other
        developmental conditions associated with human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glaucoma</ENAMEX>.
        These <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> provide a model to study these <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">diseases</ENAMEX> and
        various processes of ocular development.
      
      
        Materials and Methods
        
          Animal husbandry
          All experiments were performed in compliance with the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ARVO</ENAMEX> statement for use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> in ophthalmic and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vision</ENAMEX> research. 
          Bmp4 
          laczneo <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> used for expression
          analysis were bred at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vanderbilt University Medical</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center</ENAMEX> and eyes transferred to The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jackson Laboratory</ENAMEX>.
          All other <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">strains</ENAMEX> were obtained from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Jackson</ENAMEX>
          Laboratory (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bar Harbor</ENAMEX>, ME). <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Mice</ENAMEX> were housed in cages
          containing white pine bedding and covered with polyester
          filters. The environment was kept at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">21°C</NUMEX> with a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">14 hour</NUMEX>
          light: <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 hour</TIMEX> dark cycle. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Mice</ENAMEX> were fed NIH31 (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6 %</NUMEX> fat)
          chow 
          ad <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libitum</ENAMEX>, and their <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> was
          acidified to pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.8</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.2</NUMEX>. The mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX> was
          monitored for specific pathogens by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Jackson</ENAMEX>
          Laboratory's routine surveillance program (see
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">http://www.</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">jax</ENAMEX>.orgfor specific pathogens).
        
        
          Clinical examinations
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Anterior</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">chambers</ENAMEX> were examined with a slit lamp and
          photographs were taken using a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">40X</NUMEX> objective lens. An
          indirect ophthalmoscope and a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">60 or 90 diopter</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">lens</ENAMEX> was
          used to visualize the retinas and optic nerves. For this
          analysis <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pupils</ENAMEX> were dilated with a drop of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cyclopentolate</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">67</TIMEX> ] . Strain B6 has an incidence of a
          minor notch in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pupil</ENAMEX> that is clearly distinguishable
          from the phenotypes described here [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ] and was not
          included as an abnormal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">phenotype</ENAMEX> here.
        
        
          Histological analysis
          Eyes were fixed, processed and then embedded in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">paraffin</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Historesin</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Leica</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Heidelberg</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>). More
          than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> 
          Bmp4 +/-<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were studied. Paraffin
          embedded eyes were sagitally sectioned at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> μm while
          plastic embedded eyes were sagitally sectioned at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX> μm
          thickness. <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iridocorneal</ENAMEX> angle morphology was interpreted
          from plastic sections. For this, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 to 56</NUMEX> sections from
          each of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 to 5</NUMEX> different ocular locations (typically more
          than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> sections per eye) were collected, stained with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hematoxylin</ENAMEX> and eosin, and analyzed for each eye. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lens</ENAMEX> was used as a landmark in collecting these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sections</ENAMEX>.
          Collected regions included temporal and nasal lens
          peripheries, central lens, and regions on each side of
          the lens <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> that were halfway towards the lens
          periphery. On grading the incidence of severely affected
          angle locations, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigator</ENAMEX> did not know the IOP
          values for the eyes. The angles of every high quality
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">section</ENAMEX> were included and angles whose morphology
          suggested drainage was not possible were rated severe.
          Lacz <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">reporter</ENAMEX> gene expression was performed on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> at
          each age as previously described [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">68</TIMEX> ] .
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Electron</ENAMEX> microscopy
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Mice</ENAMEX> were euthanized and eyes were immediately
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enucleated</ENAMEX> and fixed, with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.8%</NUMEX> paraformaldehyde and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.2%</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">glutaraldehyde</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.85</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M phosphate phosphate</ENAMEX> buffer pH
          7.2 at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4°C</TIMEX>. The eyes were fixed for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one hour</TIMEX> and the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">anterior</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> removed and cut into <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1 x 2</ENAMEX> mm blocks
          that included cornea, iris, trabecular meshwork and
          ciliary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fixation</ENAMEX> was continued at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4°C</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12 hours</TIMEX>
          and the tissues were washed in phosphate buffer and then
          postfixed with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX> osmium tetroxide, dehydrated and
          embedded in epon-araldite <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">resin</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">69</TIMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> micron
          sections were cut for orientation; thin sections were
          stained with uranyl acetate and lead <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">citrate</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">70</TIMEX> ] .
        
        
          Intraocular pressure
          Intraocular pressures were measured as previously
          described [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">71 72 73</NUMEX> ] . The pressure was recorded for a
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1-minute</TIMEX> period following stabilization after the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microcannula</ENAMEX> entered the eye. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Mice</ENAMEX> of different genotypes
          were included in each measurement period, as were
          C57BL<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/6J</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>. The lOPs of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C57BL/6J</ENAMEX> are very consistent
          over time and so these <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> were interspersed with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">experimental mice</ENAMEX> to ensure that calibration had not
          drifted and that the system was functioning
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">optimally</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Immunohistochemistry
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> eyes each at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">P3 and P4</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> eyes from P7
          C57BL<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/6J</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were analyzed. Half of the eyes were from 
          Bmp4 +/-<ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> were normal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">littermates</ENAMEX>. Eyes were fixed overnight in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4%</NUMEX>
          paraformaldehyde, washed twice in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>, and equilibrated
          in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30%</NUMEX> sucrose and then frozen in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">OCT. 20 </TIMEX>m cryosections
          were prepared, dried <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">overnight</TIMEX>, and then stained with
          various <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX>. Slides were blocked in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> serum and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.4%</NUMEX> triton for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1-1 1/2 hours</TIMEX>. Primary antibodies
          were diluted in blocking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solution</ENAMEX> and applied for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-2

          Electroretinography
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Full</TIMEX> field <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERG</ENAMEX> was assessed using a previously
          reported protocol [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">77</TIMEX> ] . Briefly, following <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two hours</TIMEX>
          of dark-adaptation, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> were anesthetized by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">intraperitoneal</ENAMEX> injection of a Ketamine/xylazine mixture
          in normal saline. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERGs</ENAMEX> were recorded from the corneal
