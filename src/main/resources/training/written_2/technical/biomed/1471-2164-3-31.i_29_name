        Gene expression profiling using complementary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> (cDNA)
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microarrays</ENAMEX> is being applied for multiple purposes such as
        defining the taxonomy of different molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subtypes</ENAMEX> of
        human breast and other <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10</NUMEX> ] and
        discovering biomarkers and therapeutic targets [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12</NUMEX> ] .
        A limitation of the use of this technology is that small
        specimens of human tissue, such as obtained by core needle
        or fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsies, may not be
        sufficient for microarray hybridization using direct
        labelling protocols. Typical microarray labelling
        procedures require <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2-4 Î¼g</NUMEX> poly(A) +<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">25-50 Î</NUMEX>¼g total
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> per cDNA microarray. This amount of poly(A) +<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> or
        total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> can be obtained from samples of human tissue that
        weigh greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50-100</NUMEX> mg. However, core needle biopsies
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancers</ENAMEX>, for example, weigh in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10-25</NUMEX> mg range
        and yield <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only 3-15 Î¼g</NUMEX> of total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>. Small tumors
        identified using early detection strategies may thus be too
        small to excise a specimen with enough <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> for microarray
        analysis. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pilot</ENAMEX> study by Assersohn 
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] showed that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 15%</NUMEX> of
        FNA samples from human breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX> produced sufficient
        mRNA for expression array analysis. One approach to low
        specimen <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> input has been to use indirect labelling
        techniques to increase fluorescence signal intensity, such
        as with aminoallyl nucleotides. Although less expensive, we
        and other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">colleagues</ENAMEX> have found that indirect labelling
        techniques are not always reliable compared to direct
        labelling methods. For valuable tumor specimen, reliability
        is paramount. A very recent report used amino C6dT-modified
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">random</ENAMEX> hexamers to prime cDNA synthesis in conjunction with
        aminoallyl-dUTP and increased fluorescence intensity enough
        such that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as little as 1</NUMEX> Î¼g of total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> from cell lines
        gave sufficient signal for cDNA microarray hybridization [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> ] . The reliability of this method with human tumor
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">specimen</ENAMEX> warrants further testing.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA amplification</ENAMEX> techniques have been developed to
        address the need for sufficient <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> from tiny specimen for
        microarray hybridization. Other examples of specimen
        requiring amplification for genome-wide characterization of
        gene expression include purified <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> of cells
        obtained by either flow cytometry, laser capture
        microdissection, breast <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ductal</ENAMEX> or bronchial lavage, or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microendoscopy</ENAMEX>. Although <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> has used unamplified
        total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> extracted from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~2 Ã— 10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">4microdissected</ENAMEX> cells for
        hybridization on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5000</TIMEX> clone membrane-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arrays</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] ,
        most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> perform <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA amplification</ENAMEX> for this purpose [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18</NUMEX> ] , especially when using high-density slide-based
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arrays</ENAMEX>.
        The most commonly used mechanism for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> amplification
        is a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">T7</TIMEX> based linear amplification method <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> developed
        by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Van Gelder</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eberwine</ENAMEX> and coworkers [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 20 21</NUMEX> ] . This
        method utilizes a synthetic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oligo</ENAMEX>(dT) primer containing the
        phage <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">T7 RNA</ENAMEX> polymerase <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> to prime synthesis of
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> strand cDNA by reverse transcription of the poly(A)
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">+RNA</ENAMEX> component of total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX> strand cDNA is
        synthesized by degrading the poly(A) +<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA strand</ENAMEX> with RNase
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">H</ENAMEX>, followed by <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> strand synthesis with 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli DNA</ENAMEX> polymerase <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">I. Amplified</ENAMEX>
        antisense <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> (aRNA) is obtained from in vitro
        transcription of the double-stranded cDNA (ds cDNA)
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">template</ENAMEX> using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">T7 RNA polymerase</ENAMEX>. Several protocols based
        on this mechanism have been developed and used in
        microarray analyses [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 22 23 24 25 26 27 28</NUMEX> ] .
        In spite of the increasing use of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">T7</ENAMEX> based linear
        amplification techniques in the study of human disease,
        systematic evaluation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fidelity</ENAMEX> and the
        reproducibility of amplification mechanisms has been
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">limited</ENAMEX>. Such information is important to determine how
        well the amplified sample resembles the unamplified sample
        and the validity of applying this technique to the study of
        human tissues. A study by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wang</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Miller</ENAMEX> 
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] described <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a T7</TIMEX> based
        amplification protocol modified with a template-switching
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TS</ENAMEX>) primer used to theoretically generate a full-length ds
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cDNA</ENAMEX>. The gene expression of amplified total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> from
        melanoma cell lines hybridized to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene microarrays</ENAMEX> was
        compared to that of unamplified total or poly(A) +<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> using
        cluster analysis and determining the number of outlier
        genes between single experiments. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Approximately 3-6%</NUMEX> of
        genes were discordant outliers when analyzed using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-fold
        or greater expression ratios in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> hybridization
        and compared between total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>, mRNA, and different amounts
        of input aRNA. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hu</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">co-workers</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] compared amplified
        and unamplified samples using total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> obtained from human
        glioma cell lines and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2300</TIMEX> clone microarrays (printed with
        duplicates on the same array) to evaluate a similar T7
        based protocol with a TS mechanism adopted from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wang</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Miller</ENAMEX> 
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] . Their results were
        based on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> microarray experiments and showed concordance
        between amplified and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">unamplified samples</ENAMEX>, verifying four
        expressed and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">differentially</ENAMEX> expressed genes using
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern</ENAMEX> and Western blotting and immunohistochemical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assay</ENAMEX>.
        Since there are multiple T7 based amplification
        protocols in use, questions remain regarding the effects of
        differences between these protocols and how these
        differences translate when applied to solid tumors rather
        than cell lines on a genome-wide scale. A study from Incyte
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Genomics</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] examined gene expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">kidney</ENAMEX> vs.
        placenta <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> from matched normal and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tumor renal</ENAMEX>
        tissue using their own T7 based amplification kit (not
        employing a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TS</ENAMEX> primer) and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">9700</TIMEX> clone cDNA microarrays.
        They found that a differential expression ratio cut-off of
        greater than or equal to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-fold produced excellent
        correlation between samples amplified with different
        amounts of input poly(A) +<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> but that a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-fold
        differential expression ratio threshold should be set for
        comparing ratios between amplified and unamplified mRNA.
        Decreasing the input of tissue lysate increased gene
        expression discordance between amplified and unamplified
        samples. As more human tissues were tested, single round
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">amplification</ENAMEX> produced a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200- to 500</NUMEX>-fold yield, lower than
        the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">700</NUMEX>-fold yield originally found in their study and
        lower than yields reported in amplification studies using
        cell cultures.
        The differences between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">several T7</TIMEX> based linear
        amplification protocols are mainly the following: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>.
        whether a template-switching mechanism is used in the
        synthesis of <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> strand cDNA, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. what enzymes are used
        in the synthesis of <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> strand cDNA, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. how ds cDNA is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">purified</ENAMEX> ("cleaned up") prior to in vitro transcription,
        and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. how in vitro transcription is performed. Information
        regarding the effects of these differences on the fidelity
        or reproducibility of amplification should help eliminate
        both unnecessary procedures and those actually detrimental
        to amplification. Determination of the range of input total
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> necessary to achieve reasonable fidelity and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">reproducibility</ENAMEX> is crucial for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> dealing with
        very small specimens of human tissue.
        To answer these questions and to define an optimal
        protocol for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">T7</TIMEX> based linear amplification, we carried out
        a series of amplification reactions under different
        conditions using total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> isolated from primary human
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast carcinomas</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">amplified samples</ENAMEX> were compared to
        unamplified <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> on high-density cDNA microarrays
        containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41,931</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42,602</NUMEX> clones. We evaluated the effects
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TS</ENAMEX> primer in <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> strand cDNA synthesis, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> ligase
        activity in <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> strand cDNA synthesis, column
        purification of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ds cDNA</ENAMEX>, and in vitro transcription time on
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fidelity</ENAMEX> and reproducibility of amplification and the
        yield of aRNA. The effect of diminishing amounts of input
        total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was also tested.
      
      
        Results and Discussion
        
          Variation in cDNA microarray analysis of gene
          expression using unamplified poly(A) +<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
          In order to assess the reproducibility of microarray
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridization</ENAMEX> using standard methods, poly(A) +<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was
          isolated from both primary breast carcinoma <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BC2</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Universal Human Reference</ENAMEX> total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stratagene Â®</ENAMEX>). The
          BC2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poly</ENAMEX>(A) +<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA labelled</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cy5</ENAMEX> and the reference
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">poly</ENAMEX>(A) +<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA labelled</ENAMEX> with <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cy3</TIMEX> were hybridized on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>
          42,000 clone cDNA microarrays. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16,333</NUMEX> clones had a signal
          greater than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> above background on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all five</NUMEX> arrays.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hybridizations</ENAMEX> were done on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the same day</TIMEX> using
          arrays from the same print batch and the average
          correlation coefficient between any <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> hybridizations
          was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.97 Â± 0.01</NUMEX>, demonstrating a high reproducibility
          between parallel hybridizations done on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the same day</TIMEX>.
          Another <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hybridizations</ENAMEX> were performed using poly(A)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">+RNA</ENAMEX> isolated from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BC2</TIMEX> total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three months later</TIMEX> and a
          different print batch of microarrays. The correlation
          coefficient between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">these two arrays</TIMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.95</NUMEX>, similar to
          the average correlation coefficient of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arrays</ENAMEX>. However, when the unamplified poly(A) +<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> arrays
          performed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX> apart from different print batches were
          compared, the average correlation coefficient dropped to
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.89 Â± 0.01</NUMEX>, indicating that experimental variations due
          to differences in microarray printing, poly(A) +<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">isolation</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA labelling</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hybridization</ENAMEX> contribute
          a small but detectable change in results.
          In order to minimize experimental variations, we
          created a virtual poly(A) +<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> expression array that
          idealizes the gene expression of sample BC2 by using the
          average expression level of each clone over multiple
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridizations</ENAMEX>. By "expression level" we mean the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">normalized</ENAMEX> log (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">base2</NUMEX>) ratio of signal intensities of Cy5
          (experimental sample) to Cy3 (reference) fluorescence.
          The idealized expression profile from the poly(A) +<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
          virtual array is used as our unamplified "gold standard"
          for data analyses involving <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BC2</TIMEX>. The correlation
          coefficient between each individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">poly</ENAMEX>(A) +<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> array
          and the gold standard ranges from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.95</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.97</NUMEX>, similar to
          that observed between hybridizations performed on the
          same day. The gold standard virtual array therefore
          represents well-measured gene expression in the primary
          tumor and minimizes individual experimental
          variations.
        
        
          Template-switching does not affect the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fidelity of</ENAMEX>
          amplification
          As previously mentioned, a protocol based on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">T7</TIMEX> based
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">linear</ENAMEX> amplification published by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wang</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miller</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coworkers</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] incorporated a TS mechanism [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] in
          the synthesis of <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> strand cDNA at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>' end in
          order to generate full-length ds cDNA. This was
          speculated to be of advantage in the hybridization of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unmapped</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> spotted on arrays and to enable higher
          temperature cDNA synthesis that would enhance sequence
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">specificity</ENAMEX>. However, no experimental evidence was
          provided to support the idea that the TS mechanism
          increases the fidelity of amplification.
          To determine whether the addition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TS</ENAMEX> primer
          improves the fidelity of amplification, we compared gene
          expression profiles of aRNA amplified in the presence or
          absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TS</ENAMEX> primer with expression profiles of
          unamplified poly(A) +<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>. Total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> isolated from primary
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast carcinoma</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BC91</ENAMEX> and reference total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> were
          amplified with or without <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TS</ENAMEX> primer using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wang</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Miller</ENAMEX>
          protocol [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] , except that aRNA was purified using an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">RNeasy Â®kit</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Qiagen Â®</ENAMEX>). A virtual "gold standard" poly(A)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">+RNA array</ENAMEX> was created for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BC91</TIMEX> using the average
          expression level of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> hybridization replicates of
          unamplified poly(A) +<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>. A "virtual correlation
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coefficient</ENAMEX>" for a given amplification protocol was
          obtained by comparing the virtual amplified array
          (averaged expression level for each clone from multiple
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">amplified samples</ENAMEX>) to the virtual gold standard
          unamplified array for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BC91</TIMEX>. To determine the correlation
          between individual amplified samples and the gold
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">standard</ENAMEX>, an "average correlation coefficient" for a
          given amplification protocol was also calculated (the sum
          of correlation coefficients of individual amplified
          samples with the gold standard divided by the number of
          amplified samples tested for each condition).
          As shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>, using aRNA amplified from total
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> as reference, the expression profiles obtained in the
          absence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TS</ENAMEX> primer correlated with the gold standard
          slightly better than in the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TS</ENAMEX> primer,
          although the difference was not statistically
          significant. When poly(A) +<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> rather than total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was
          amplified as reference, the correlation with the gold
          standard was slightly, but not statistically
          significantly, better with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TS</ENAMEX> primer (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). The
          correlation coefficient using aRNA amplified from total
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> as reference is higher than using aRNA amplified from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">poly</ENAMEX>(A) +<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> as reference regardless of whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TS</ENAMEX> primer
          is used. This suggests that when total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> from a tumor
          sample is amplified for microarray analysis, the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">reference RNA</ENAMEX> should also be amplified from total
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>.
          The yield of aRNA amplified from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BC91</TIMEX> total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> using
          different protocols is shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>. Assuming <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1%</NUMEX> of
          the total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> is poly(A) +<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>, a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">253 and 370</NUMEX>-fold
          amplification was observed in the presence and absence of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TS</ENAMEX> primer, respectively. The yield of aRNA amplified from
          total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> which are generated from cultured cell lines
          was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2- to 3</NUMEX>-fold higher than when the primary tumor total
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> was amplified (data not shown).
          These experiments demonstrate that the TS mechanism
          does not increase the fidelity of amplification, and
          therefore can be eliminated from the protocol. The
          reasons for the limited effect of the TS mechanism on the
          correlation coefficients probably are: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) the second
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">strand</ENAMEX> cDNA synthesis primed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TS</ENAMEX> primer probably
          represents a small fraction, while the majority of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">synthesis</ENAMEX> is self-primed or primed by small pieces of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>
          generated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNase H</ENAMEX>; and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) adding a few <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base</ENAMEX> pairs to
          the ds cDNA prior to in vitro transcription does not
          change the aRNA significantly enough to affect the array
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridization</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> ligase activity is not required for
          amplification
          Amplification protocols that do not include <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> ligase
          in <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> strand cDNA synthesis generate the same length
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">aRNA</ENAMEX> (ranging from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.2</NUMEX> kb to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> kb, data not shown) as
          generated from a widely used <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">T7</ENAMEX> based amplification
          protocol developed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix Â®</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] which uses 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">E. coli DNA ligase</ENAMEX>. The correlation
          coefficient between amplified and unamplified sample and
          the yield of aRNA amplified without <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA ligase</ENAMEX> are high
          enough to suggest that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> ligase activity is not
          necessary for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA amplification</ENAMEX> in microarray analysis.
          For confirmation, we omitted <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA ligase</ENAMEX> from the protocol
          developed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affymetrix</ENAMEX> Â®and compared the expression
          profiles of the resulting aRNA to aRNA obtained using the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">standard Affymetrix</ENAMEX> Â®protocol that includes <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA ligase</ENAMEX>.
          The correlation coefficient between amplified and
          unamplified <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> is slightly higher in the absence of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ligase</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>), supporting our previous conclusion that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ligase</ENAMEX> is not required for total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA amplification</ENAMEX> in
          cDNA microarray analysis. However, the yield of aRNA is
          higher when ligase is used, suggesting that ligase may
          play a role in improving the efficiency of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">amplification</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Column cleanup of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ds cDNA</ENAMEX> does not improve the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fidelity</ENAMEX> of amplification, but decreases the yield of
          aRNA
          In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wang</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miller</ENAMEX> protocol [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] , ds cDNA is
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">purified</ENAMEX> using a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Bio-6</ENAMEX> column (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bio-Rad</ENAMEX>). A drawback to
          this method is that the cDNA is eluted with a large
          volume and needs to be concentrated into a much smaller
          volume by lyophilization prior to in vitro transcription.
          This is a time-consuming step, especially when large
          numbers of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> are processed. To eliminate the
          lyophilization step from the protocol, we used an
          alternative column-the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sephadexâ„¢ G-50</ENAMEX> column-to filter
          out free nucleotides from the ds cDNA after completion of
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> strand synthesis reaction. The ds cDNA is then
          precipitated following phenol-<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">chloroform</ENAMEX> extraction and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">re</ENAMEX>-suspended in proper volume for in vitro transcription.
          The correlation coefficient between amplified and
          unamplified <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> and the yield of aRNA using this less
          time-consuming modification are similar to that using the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wang-Miller</ENAMEX> protocol (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tables 1and 2</ENAMEX>).
          We further explored the question of what effects the
          ds cDNA column cleanup step itself had on amplification.
          We amplified total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> from tumor <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BC2</TIMEX>, either with or
          without the cleanup step of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sephadexâ„¢ G-50</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Seven</NUMEX>
          amplifications were done on different dates with the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sephadexâ„¢ G-50</ENAMEX> column and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">amplifications</ENAMEX> were done
          without this cleanup step. Both the virtual and the
          average correlation coefficients using the column are
          slightly lower than without it (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>), suggesting that
          the column cleanup does not improve the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fidelity of</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">amplification</ENAMEX>. Moreover, the yield of aRNA is
          significantly higher without the column purification of
          ds cDNA, suggesting some loss of ds cDNA on the column.
          Since the column had a negative effect on amplification
          by decreasing the yield of aRNA without improving the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fidelity</ENAMEX> of amplification, we eliminated this step from
          our protocol.
        
        
          Effect of in vitro transcription time on the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fidelity</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> amplification
          To determine the effect of in vitro transcription time
          on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">amplification</TIMEX>, duplicate reactions were performed at
          37Â°C for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2, 3, 4</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 and 6 hours</TIMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> additional <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5-hour</TIMEX>
          incubation reactions were stored at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4Â°C overnight</TIMEX> to
          determine the effect of low temperature incubation on
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">amplification</ENAMEX>. The virtual correlation coefficient is
          slightly higher for the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5-hour</TIMEX> incubation at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37Â°C</TIMEX> (Figure
          1A). However, in vitro transcription for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 hours</TIMEX> at 37Â°C
          plus <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">overnight</TIMEX> incubation at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4Â°C</TIMEX> gives the highest yield
          of aRNA (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1B</NUMEX>). Since the yield of aRNA at any time
          point is sufficient for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple hybridizations</ENAMEX>, we
          decided to use <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5-hour</TIMEX> incubation at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37Â°C</TIMEX> for all
          subsequent amplifications.
        
        
          Evaluation of the fidelity of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">T7</ENAMEX> based linear
          amplification protocols
          To systematically evaluate the fidelity of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">T7</ENAMEX> based
          amplification, we compared the correlation coefficient
          obtained from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> different protocols. The correlation
          coefficients of individual samples amplified using
          different protocols with the gold standard range from
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.74</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.86</NUMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). The scatter plots comparing the
          gene expression of the virtual amplified samples for each
          protocol with the unamplified gold standard are shown in
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, with the virtual correlation coefficients
          ranging from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.83</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.86</NUMEX>. The differences in correlations
          obtained using different protocols are not statistically
          different by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Student</ENAMEX>'s 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> -test, demonstrating that
          differences in gene expression for samples amplified
          using different protocols are minor.
          Our results also suggest that the level of bias
          introduced into gene expression profiling by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">amplification</ENAMEX> is relatively low; expression profiles
          obtained using aRNA provide a close approximation of the
          true expression profile of the original sample. To assess
          the biases of amplification quantitatively, we calculated
          the number and percentage of genes with expression level
          change by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>- or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-fold after amplification. The biases of
          amplification by different protocols are similar.
          Specifically, less than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.2%</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11,123</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12-15</NUMEX>
          genes) changed their expression level by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-fold or
          greater and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 6%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">306</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">594</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>) changed
          expression by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-fold or greater after amplification. With
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeffrey</ENAMEX> lab protocol, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 4%</NUMEX> of genes showed
          changes in expression level by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-fold or greater. Of the
          genes that changed, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">139</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> changed their
          expression in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all four</NUMEX> protocols in the same direction
          greater than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-fold and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-fold, respectively. Also, the
          virtual correlation coefficients between different
          protocols are high (average <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.95</NUMEX>) (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>), suggesting
          that slight differences in protocols based on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">T7</TIMEX> linear
          amplification mechanism do not affect the correlation of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">amplified samples</ENAMEX> to unamplified samples. These results
          suggest the conclusion that aRNA provides a close
          approximation of the true expression profile of the
          original sample.
          We present here a components of variance model for
          explaining the different <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX> of variation in the
          amplification protocols (see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Statistical Appendix</ENAMEX>,
          additional file <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). The expression measurement for a gene
          for a specific array/protocol/sample can be broken down
          as
          Additional File 1
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Statistical</ENAMEX> Appendix
          Click here for file
          X = <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Z</ENAMEX> + e, where
          X is the measured expression value
          Z is the "true" expression that does not change under
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">replication</ENAMEX>, and
          e is the measurement error that does change under
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">replication</ENAMEX>.
          While we cannot estimate Z and e directly, we can
          estimate their variances from the data. For the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
          different amplified protocols and the unamplified arrays,
          the relevant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">variances</ENAMEX> are estimated in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5</ENAMEX>. The
          variance of the true expression (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Var Z</ENAMEX>) ranges from
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.623</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.661</NUMEX> for the amplified protocols and is <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.726</NUMEX> for
          the unamplified arrays. The variance of the measurement
          error (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Var</ENAMEX> e) ranges from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.055</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.102</NUMEX> for the amplified
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">protocols</ENAMEX> and is <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.059</NUMEX> for the unamplified arrays. The
          estimates of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Var Z</ENAMEX> were obtained by averaging the
          pairwise covariances of the replicates within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">each</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">protocol</ENAMEX>, and the estimates of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Var</ENAMEX> e by using the
          within-protocol variance. (While the variance of a
          collection of numbers measures how much they vary about
          their mean, the covariance of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sets of numbers
          measures how much they vary with respect to each other.
          See <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Statistical Appendix</ENAMEX> for more details). We notice
          that <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Var Z</ENAMEX> for unamplified poly(A) +<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> is larger than
          all of the others, indicating a dampening effect on gene
          expression by amplification. Measurement error variance
          is lowest for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeffrey</ENAMEX> lab protocol.
          The covariances between the different <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Zs</ENAMEX> for the
          different methods (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">estimated</NUMEX> from the virtual arrays) are
          shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 6</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">off-diagonal</ENAMEX> elements of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX> 6are
          the covariances; the diagonal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> are the variances
          of the virtual arrays. We notice that covariances among
          the amplified protocols, which range from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.62 to 0.66</NUMEX>,
          are higher than their covariances with the unamplified
          arrays, which range <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">between 0.57 and 0.61</NUMEX>. Furthermore,
          the variances of the amplified protocols (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.63 to 0.68</NUMEX>)
          are lower than that of the unamplifed (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.74</NUMEX>).
          This suggests the following further breakdown:
          Z = <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zc + Zs</ENAMEX>, where
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zc</ENAMEX> is a common expression component, with variance
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 0.6</NUMEX>, and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zs</ENAMEX> is a specific expression component, with variance
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 0.04</NUMEX> for the amplified arrays and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.14</NUMEX> for the
          unamplified arrays.
          Therefore, the amplified expression values for genes
          on an array are largely the same as on the unamplified
          array. The component of variation in which they differ
          appears to be common for all amplified protocols, and
          shows a much higher variance in the unamplified arrays.
          The effect of amplification can be summarized by saying
          that it has a dampening effect on the true expression of
          some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (decreased variance in gene expression - see
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>).
          A recent report compared amplified expression profiles
          of different primary breast tumors using Affymetrix
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Â®arrays</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] . Unger 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX> found that correlation
          coefficients between gene expressions in different tumors
          revealed by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">aRNA</ENAMEX> ranged <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between 0.71</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.89</NUMEX>. However, gene
          expression was not measured using unamplified poly(A)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">+RNA</ENAMEX> from these different tumors, raising the question of
          whether the observed fairly high correlation between
          diverse tumors was due to amplification bias. To answer
          this question, we compared the correlation coefficients
          between gene expression profiles of different tumors
          determined either with unamplified poly(A) +<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> or aRNA
          amplified using our protocol (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 7</ENAMEX>). The correlation
          coefficients between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">BC2</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BC91</ENAMEX> measured using poly(A)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">+RNA</ENAMEX> or aRNA are the same, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.55</NUMEX>. Moreover, the
          correlation between differences in gene expression
          between amplified and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">unamplified samples</ENAMEX> for different
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tumors</ENAMEX> is weak (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>), suggesting that genes that
          differ through amplification depend on the sample rather
          than on systematic changes from amplification. Our
          results demonstrate that different primary breast tumors
          are not closely related to each other in gene expression
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">profiles</ENAMEX>, and amplification does not affect the
          correlation of gene expression between different tumors.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amplification</ENAMEX> is therefore suitable for comparison of
          gene expression profiles among large sample sets.
        
        
          Evaluation of reproducibility of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">T7</ENAMEX> based linear
          amplification
          Another important aspect of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA amplification</ENAMEX> is the
          degree of reproducibility. To evaluate this, we
          calculated the correlation coefficients between
          individual amplified samples. The correlation
          coefficients between <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individual</ENAMEX> hybridizations done on
          the same day for poly(A) +<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> averaged <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.97</NUMEX> and for aRNA
          amplified on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the same day</TIMEX> averaged from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.91</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.98</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>). The correlation coefficients between individual
          hybridizations done on different <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> averaged <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.89</NUMEX> for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">poly</ENAMEX>(A) +<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.85</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.90</NUMEX> for aRNA amplified from total
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> on different <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>. The reproducibility of our
          protocol is slightly better than that using other
          protocols. Notably, when <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> are amplified on the
          same day, the correlations are significantly higher than
          when <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> are amplified on different <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX>. In
          addition, samples amplified with protocols omitting
          ligase activity give higher reproducibility regardless of
          whether they are amplified on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the same day</TIMEX> or not.
        
        
          The effect of the amount of input total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> on
          amplification
          To determine the effect of the amount of input total
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> on single round amplification, we amplified different
          amounts of total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3 Î¼g, 1 Î¼g, 300</ENAMEX> ng, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> ng, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> ng
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> ng, using different amounts of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T7</ENAMEX> primer according
          to the quantity of input total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 9</ENAMEX>). When the
          input total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> is lower than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX> ng, the yield of aRNA
          for is lower than the standard quantity required for one
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridization</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3 Î¼g</ENAMEX>). At amounts greater or equal to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX>
          ng, the correlation coefficients between amplified and
          unamplified <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> and among amplified samples remain
          about the same. The fold of amplification increases with
          smaller quantities of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">template RNA</ENAMEX>, but the absolute
          yield of aRNA decreases. Therefore, within the range of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.3</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> Î¼g total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX>, decreasing the input <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> does not

        Conclusions
        In conclusion, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">T7</TIMEX> based linear amplification generates
        high fidelity aRNA for gene expression profiling using
        high-density cDNA microarrays. The average correlation
        coefficient between amplified and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">unamplified samples</ENAMEX> is
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.82</NUMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 4%</NUMEX> of genes showing changes in
        expression level by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-fold or greater using the optimized
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeffrey</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">lab</ENAMEX>) protocol. The correlation to unamplified
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">poly</ENAMEX>(A) +<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> increases to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.85</NUMEX> when experimental
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variability</ENAMEX> is minimized by configuring multiple amplified
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> into a virtual array. Reproducibility between
        samples amplified with this technique is high, especially
        when performed on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the same day</TIMEX> rather than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</TIMEX> apart.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amplification</ENAMEX> produces a dampening effect on gene
        expression variation.
