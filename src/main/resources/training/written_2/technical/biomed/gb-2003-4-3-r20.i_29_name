        Plants respond to invasion by pathogens with an array of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biochemical</ENAMEX> and genetic changes, including the production
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">reactive oxygen species</ENAMEX>, antimicrobial compounds,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antioxidants</ENAMEX> and signaling molecules such as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">salicylic acid</ENAMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SA</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">jasmonic acid</ENAMEX> (JA). They also respond by the
        localized activation of a cell-death program, designated
        the hypersensitive response (HR), and by the systemic
        activation of cellular and molecular defenses, termed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systemic</ENAMEX> acquired <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> (SAR) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3 4 5 6 7</NUMEX> ] .
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">messengers</ENAMEX> that contribute to the development of the
        systemic response include reactive <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">oxygen species</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ROS</ENAMEX>),
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethylene</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9 10</NUMEX> ] . There is evidence for
        commonalities between <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> responses to pathogens
        (referred to as defense responses) and environmental
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">stresses</ENAMEX> (referred to as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX> responses) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12</NUMEX> ] .
        Despite similarities, however, a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>'s response to each
        environmental challenge is unique and tailored to
        increasing the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>'s ability to survive the inciting
        stress [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14 15 16</NUMEX> ] .
        A comprehensive understanding of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> of genes,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and small molecules that underlie plant <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX> and
        defense responses requires identification and
        characterization of the molecular components, including the
        genes that respond both initially and as the physiological
        response to the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">pathogen</ENAMEX> develops. Several groups
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18</NUMEX> ] have used existing expressed sequence tag (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX>)
        collections to carry out <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">microarray</ENAMEX> experiments in initial
        efforts to identify genes whose expression levels change in
        response to pathogens and various abiotic stresses.
        However, existing <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> collections are not complete and most
        were derived from cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> made from <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> grown
        under normal environmental conditions; hence, ESTs
        representing stress- and pathogen-induced transcripts are
        likely to be under-represented in them.
        To characterize the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX>/defense <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">transcriptome</ENAMEX> of 
        Arabidopsis more thoroughly, we
        sought to identify genes whose expression levels change in
        response to abiotic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX>, known second <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">messengers</ENAMEX> and
        bacterial and fungal pathogens. We used the bacterial
        pathogen 
        Pseudomonas syringae and the oomycete
        pathogen 
        Peronospora parasitica to evoke the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathogen</ENAMEX> defense response. The availability of both
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">avirulent</ENAMEX> and virulent strains of these pathogens
        facilitates identification of genes that are important for
        resistance, as well as those expressed during disease
        development [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 20 21</NUMEX> ] . Moreover, both of these
        pathogens cause severe damage to <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crops</ENAMEX> of economic
        importance, such as tomato and crucifers [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . We also
        treated <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methyl jasmonate</ENAMEX> (MJ) because
        both are important signaling molecules implicated in plant
        responses to pathogens, herbivory and wounding and they
        induce different aspects of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAR</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] .
        We used <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ozone</ENAMEX> as an abiotic stressor because the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>'s
        response at the biochemical and molecular level shows
        extensive overlap with the pathogen defense response and
        includes the production of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ROS</ENAMEX>, as well as induction of HR
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAR</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 24</NUMEX> ] . At the phenotypic level, acute ozone
        exposure (high dose for a short interval) causes necrotic
        lesions similar to those caused by avirulent pathogen
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">infections</ENAMEX>, whereas chronic ozone exposure (low dose for an
        extended period of time) accelerates foliar senescence,
        producing similar symptoms to those caused by virulent
        pathogen infections [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 26</NUMEX> ] . There is evidence that
        elicitor-evoked <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ROS</ENAMEX> production, called the oxidative burst,
        is an essential signaling component of the defense response
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] . Moreover <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ozone</ENAMEX> is a component of photochemical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">smog</ENAMEX> and itself represents an oxidative stress to living
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">organisms</ENAMEX>, damaging <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crops</ENAMEX> and forests [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] .
        There are several strategies for identifying
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentially</ENAMEX> expressed transcripts, including
        differential display (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DD</ENAMEX>), representational difference
        analysis (RDA), serial analysis of gene expression (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAGE</ENAMEX>),
        enzymatic degradation subtraction and subtractive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hybridization</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29 30 31 32 33</NUMEX> ] . We chose the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">PCR</ENAMEX>-based
        suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) procedure for
        several reasons: it includes a normalization step, it
        enriches for differentially expressed transcripts, and it
        yields cDNA fragments that can be used directly for the
        construction of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA microarrays</ENAMEX>. We viewed the
        normalization step as particularly important because a few
        stress-activated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, such as those encoding the
        pathogenesis-related (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PR</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, are abundantly induced
        by a variety of stresses, potentially obscuring important
        stress-specific transcripts expressed at much lower levels.
        The SSH procedure developed by Diatchenko 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] has the additional
        advantage that it exploits the suppression PCR effect,
        eliminating the need for physical separation of single- and
        double-stranded cDNAs [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] . We have cloned and sequenced
        cDNA fragments representing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,058</NUMEX> stress-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> from
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> different SSH cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>. We describe and discuss
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX>/defense-induced genes we have identified, many
        of which have either not previously been associated with
        stress responses or are not represented in existing cDNA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">libraries</ENAMEX>.

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">Plants</ENAMEX> of the 
          Arabidopsis ecotype <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Col-0</ENAMEX> show
          disease symptoms when infiltrated with virulent 
          Pseudomonas syringae pv. 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tomato</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DC3000</ENAMEX> or when sprayed with
          the oomycete 
          Peronospora parasitica strain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ahco</ENAMEX>.
          The avirulent bacterial strain of 
          P. syringae expressing the 
          avrRpm1 gene elicits a marked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HR</ENAMEX> in
          Col-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>, whereas the 
          P. parasitica strain <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Emwa</ENAMEX> elicits a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microscopic HR</ENAMEX>. All treatments, including pathogen
          infection and treatment with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ozone</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SA</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MJ</ENAMEX>, were
          carried out on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">-week-old plants</ENAMEX>. All treatments affect
          foliar tissue, which was the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">material</ENAMEX> used for library
          construction.
          To capture a wide spectrum of differentially expressed
          genes, leaf tissue was collected at different intervals
          after the treatment and pooled before <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> extraction
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). Leaves were harvested at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1, 3, 6, 9</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> after acute ozone treatment and at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 and 24</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> after bacterial infection and after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MJ</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SA</ENAMEX>
          treatments. Because fungal spores take <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">almost a day</TIMEX> to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">germinate</ENAMEX> and penetrate the host <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> were
          collected at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12 hours</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 and 3 days</TIMEX> in the incompatible
          oomycete interaction. In the case of the compatible
          interaction the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> fails to recognize the pathogen
          early and mounts a response only when the pathogen has
          proliferated extensively (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3-5 days</TIMEX>). Samples were
          therefore collected <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">up to day 5</TIMEX> after inoculation. For
          the chronic ozone treatment, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> were harvested <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,4</NUMEX>
          and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6 days</TIMEX> after exposure.
          The efficiency of subtraction was evaluated by PCR
          amplification of a housekeeping gene, that for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">gyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase</ENAMEX> ( 
          G3PDH ), and one of several
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentially</ENAMEX> expressed genes. If subtraction is
          efficient, transcripts of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">housekeeping genes</ENAMEX> should be
          reduced, while those of differentially expressed genes
          should be substantially enriched in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of
          cDNA fragments used for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> construction. Figure
          1shows that the 
          G3PDH fragment is barely detectable
          even after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cycles</ENAMEX> of amplification in the subtracted
          sample, while it is clearly detectable in the
          unsubtracted sample after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cycles</ENAMEX>. To test enrichment
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">differentially</ENAMEX> expressed genes, we amplified the 
          PR1 gene for the biotic stressors
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SA</ENAMEX> treatment, the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> defensin gene 
          PDF1<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.2</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">MJ</ENAMEX> treatment, and the
          amino-cyclopropane synthase gene ( 
          ACS1 ) for the ozone treatments [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 35</NUMEX> ] . The genes tested showed strong amplification in
          the subtracted samples after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cycles</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX>, whereas in
          the unsubtracted samples the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> product was seen only
          after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> additional cycles (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). On the basis of
          the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> cycles required for equal amplification
          of the corresponding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> products from the subtracted and
          unsubtracted <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cDNA samples</ENAMEX>, we estimated that the
          subtracted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32-64-fold</NUMEX> enriched for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentially</ENAMEX> expressed genes.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the main advantages of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSH</ENAMEX> is that it
          normalizes the cDNA abundance so that cDNAs encoded by
          genes that are expressed infrequently, but nonetheless
          differentially, can be identified readily [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] . The
          efficiency of normalization is illustrated in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>.
          The more uniform distribution of hybridization
          intensities obtained using the subtracted cDNA probe
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2c</NUMEX>) reflects the equalization in the
          concentrations of individual species present at markedly
          different concentrations in the initial unsubtracted cDNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">populations</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2b</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Differential expression of genes identified by
          SSH
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cDNA</ENAMEX> clones for differentially expressed genes were
          identified by successively screening new clones first
          with the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">unsubtracted</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">driver</ENAMEX> cDNA (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2a</NUMEX>) and tester
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2b</NUMEX>) cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pools</ENAMEX> as the probes, then the
          forward-subtracted (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2c</NUMEX>) and reverse-subtracted
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2d</NUMEX>) cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pools</ENAMEX> as probes. The first screen
          identifies cDNAs corresponding to only the most abundant
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentially</ENAMEX> expressed genes, while the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> screen
          identifies genes that are expressed less abundantly, but
          still differentially. The results from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
          hybridizations were recorded for each clone, and those
          showing the most marked differential expression were
          selected for sequencing. Although selecting clones that
          showed strong hybridization only with the forward
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">subtracted pool</ENAMEX> was straightforward, it was more
          difficult to select <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">differentially</ENAMEX> expressed genes when
          signals were detected in both the forward-subtracted and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">unsubtracted</ENAMEX> pools. We endeavored to select those clones
          that showed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-fold differential hybridization. However,
          as this was done by visual inspection, such genes
          constitute a potential source of false positives.
          After screening the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> (acute
          ozone, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SA</ENAMEX> and virulent oomycete infection), we
          incorporated an additional procedure that permitted us to
          identify clones already represented in our collection.
          This was necessary simply because there is significant
          overlap at the molecular level in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> responses to
          different stresses and cDNA fragments were being
          identified and sequenced redundantly. We therefore pooled
          and labeled aliquots of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> from sequenced clones, using
          them to probe each new set of clones. This procedure not
          only permitted identification of clones representing
          genes in previous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>, but also allowed us to
          monitor the completeness of screening of each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX>.
          Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3shows</TIMEX> that the yield of new clones decreased as
          the number of clones examined increased, indicating that
          by the time <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several hundred</NUMEX> clones had been examined, few
          new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> remain to be identified in a given <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX>. As
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> were both normalized and enriched for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentially</ENAMEX> expressed sequences, it is likely that the
          recovery of cDNAs for differentially expressed genes is
          reasonably complete. It should be noted, however, that
          because we screened each new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> for clones we had
          already identified in previous <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>
          are not independent of each other. This procedure might
          also lead us to miss highly homologous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of
          multigene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>.
          We cloned and sequenced the reverse-subtracted cDNAs
          for just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>, those prepared from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ozone-</ENAMEX>treated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> and those infected with a virulent strain of the
          oomycete pathogen. Although we screened <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">almost 600</NUMEX> clones
          in these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>, we identified cDNAs for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 48</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentially</ENAMEX> expressed genes, most of which encode
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> involved in photosynthesis. Thus it appears that
          a relatively small number of genes is downregulated by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX> and suggests that different kinds of stress
          downregulate the same <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>.
          Although differential expression of every gene has not
          yet been tested under every <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress condition</ENAMEX>, of the more
          than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">700</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> tested to date, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">roughly 90%</NUMEX> have exhibited
          differential expression by either northern blotting or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> microarray analysis (see Additional data files), each
          of which has different sensitivity limitations. Some
          representative northern blots are shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>.
          Because these tests have been carried out under a more
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">limited</ENAMEX> set of conditions than those represented by the
          treatments used for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> construction, it appears
          likely that most of the cDNA clones described here
          represent differentially expressed genes.
        
        
          Sequence analysis of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX> ESTs
          We sequenced <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,461</NUMEX> clones selected for differential
          expression as described above from among <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 6,000</NUMEX>
          clones in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> stress cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>. On average,
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12%</NUMEX> of the sequences in each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> were redundant
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). The frequency with which identical cDNA
          fragments were isolated and sequenced was low
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 2%</NUMEX>), in large part because of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prescreening</ENAMEX> to eliminate such redundancy. Most of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">redundancy</ENAMEX> within <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX>), as well as between
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">libraries</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX>), resulted from the use of 
          Rsa I-restricted cDNA fragments in
          the SSH procedure. Because of the restriction step, two

          or more different cloned cDNA fragments can represent a
          single transcript. This type of redundancy was rapidly
          identified using coincidence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Munich</ENAMEX> Information
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center for Protein Sequences</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIPS</ENAMEX>) identifiers. Thus the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,461</NUMEX> different fragments sequenced identified a total of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,058</NUMEX> different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>).
          With the information gathered from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIPS</ENAMEX> 
          Arabidopsis database [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] and
          InterPro <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> domain searches [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] we were able to
          identify or assign putative functions to about
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">three-quarters</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">764</ENAMEX>) of the genes in the stress cDNA
          collection. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">More than 290</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSH</ENAMEX> clones encoded proteins
          with insufficient similarity to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> of known
          function to assign a function with confidence, and we
          therefore classified them as being of unknown function.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> of known function were sorted into the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>
          primary functional categories [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] . The distribution
          of the genes with known or predicted functions is
          represented as a pie chart in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>. The largest set
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15%</NUMEX>) was assigned to the metabolism category,
          while genes involved in cell growth/<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">division</ENAMEX> constituted
          the smallest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, comprising <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 2%</NUMEX> of the genes.
          Genes involved in signal transduction and protein
          destination/storage formed the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13%</NUMEX>) and third
          largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12%</NUMEX>), respectively. Genes implicated in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX>/defense response and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> involved in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcription</ENAMEX> together constituted <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> of the stress cDNA
          collection (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>).
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Digital</ENAMEX> northern analysis
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> datasets have been used recently to extract
          information on gene-expression levels [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39 40 41</NUMEX> ] . The
          underlying assumption of such a 'digital northern'
          analysis is that the number of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> clones is proportional
          to the abundance of the mRNA used for constructing the
          library [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ] . Most 
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Arabidopsis EST</TIMEX> collections are
          derived from non-normalized cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>, making them
          useful for this purpose [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX> ] . We recorded the number
          of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> hits from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIPS</ENAMEX> summary report link or by BLAST
          searches with the 
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Arabidopsis EST</TIMEX> database for each
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clone</ENAMEX> in our stress collection. Using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1/20,000</NUMEX> as the
          definition of a rare message [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44 45 46</NUMEX> ] and knowing
          that there are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 100,000</NUMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis ESTs</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">GenBank</ENAMEX>, we
          consider genes with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fewer than six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> to represent
          rarely transcribed <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>.
          By the foregoing criteria, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">577</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">55%</NUMEX>) of the
          stress-inducible genes are in the rarely transcribed
          category and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">178</NUMEX> of these (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">17%</NUMEX>) are not represented by an
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> in the 
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Arabidopsis EST</TIMEX> database. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only 2</NUMEX>
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.0018%</NUMEX>) of the genes in the stress cDNA collection are
          represented by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 200</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> and can be classified
          as abundantly transcribed. These are the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rubisco</ENAMEX> activase
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">A0zUF12, At2g39730</ENAMEX>) and a polyubiquitin gene (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">APP-FD09</ENAMEX>,
          At5g05320). The remaining <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">479</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">45%</NUMEX>) cDNAs correspond to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes transcribed</ENAMEX> at moderate rate (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">7-200 ESTs</ENAMEX>) in
          unstressed <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>. This analysis does not, of course,
          reflect the stress-altered levels of these transcripts.
          Nonetheless, it reveals that a significant fraction of
          stress-modulated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> is not represented in existing <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX>
          collections and that many are infrequently transcribed in
          normal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>, underlining the need to construct
          specialized <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Promoter analysis
          The number, order, and type of protein-binding
          sequences present in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> are major determinants of
          the differences in expression patterns of genes. Because
          the transcript levels of the genes represented in the
          present collection change in response to stress,
          protein-binding motifs associated with
          stress-inducibility should be over-represented in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> of the stress collection when compared with the
          total complement of 
          Arabidopsis <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX>. We compared
          the frequency of occurrence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> different
          stress-related motifs in the total collection, and in
          each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> individually, with their frequencies in the
          total <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of 
          Arabidopsis <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> (see
          Materials and methods).
          We found that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> stress-related motifs
          analyzed were over-represented in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> sequences
          of the stress collection as a whole (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3a</ENAMEX>), and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
          additional motifs were over-represented in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX>
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3b</ENAMEX>). The
          ABRE-like motif, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX>-box motif, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX>-box-like motif,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SA</ENAMEX>-inducible motif, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>-box and the TGA motifs were
          significantly over-represented in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> of the
          stress collection as a whole, compared with the total
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of 
          Arabidopsis <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3a</ENAMEX>).
          The H-box factor (HBF) motif was over-represented in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> of genes represented in the virulent bacterial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">library</ENAMEX>, heat-shock element (HSE) and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Myb4</ENAMEX> motifs were
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-represented in the avirulent bacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX>, and
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Myc</ENAMEX> motif was over-represented in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SA</ENAMEX> library
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3b</ENAMEX>). We also looked for combinations of motifs
          that had been reported to function together [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">47</TIMEX> ] . The
          G-box and H-box motifs occur together in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> in
          our collection ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.00587</NUMEX>). Over all, more than
          half of the tested stress motifs are over-represented in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> of the genes in the stress cDNA collection,
          reflecting its enrichment for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX>-responsive genes.
          The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethylene</ENAMEX>-related motifs (GCC-box and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EIN3</ENAMEX>), and
          the drought-response element (DRE), <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AtMyb1</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AtMyb2</ENAMEX> and
          AtMyb3 motifs were not statistically significantly
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-represented in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> of genes identified by
          the stress cDNA collection.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        
          Analysis of the total SSH library
          To assess the contribution of the present stress cDNA
          collection to characterizing the 
          Arabiopsis <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress transcriptome</ENAMEX>, we
          examined <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> recent reports of 
          
          Arabidopsis <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX>/defense-modulated genes that used
          either commercial or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigator</ENAMEX>-constructed cDNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microarrays</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 17 18 48 49</NUMEX> ] . Using the accession
          numbers provided in each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publication</ENAMEX>, we retrieved each
          sequence from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX> database. We then used BLAST at
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAIR</ENAMEX> site to search the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AGI</ENAMEX> genome database and
          identified the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIPS</ENAMEX> code for the differentially expressed
          genes reported in each of these studies. Once the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIPS</ENAMEX>
          code had been identified, we were able to estimate the
          number of genes differentially expressed in each of these
          studies and determine the overlap between each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> and
          the stress cDNA collection (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>).
          The extent of overlap between the stress cDNA
          collection and the subset of stress- or defense-modulated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> ranged from a low of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16%</NUMEX> with the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">308</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>
          identified by Maleck 
          et al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] ) to a high of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">32%</NUMEX>
          with the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">507</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> reported by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schenk</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . Thus
          almost <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70%</NUMEX> of the genes in the stress cDNA collection
          have not previously been identified as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX>/defense
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">modulated</ENAMEX>. Conversely, a significant number of genes
          reported to be induced or repressed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX>/defense
          response is not represented in the stress cDNA
          collection. This may be attributable in part to the
          stringency of the differential expression criterion
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-fold difference between experimental and control
          expression levels) we used in selecting clones to
          sequence. As the criterion for differential expression in
          the microarray studies analyzed was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX>-fold over
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> levels, many genes identified as differentially
          expressed in these studies would not have been included
          in our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>.
          Although we do not have the information to determine
          all of the reasons for the limited overlap between
          previous studies and the present <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX>, we can identify
          several contributing factors. A major factor is the
          ability of the SSH procedure to identify genes that are
          expressed differentially, but at low levels. As noted
          earlier, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than half</NUMEX> of the differentially expressed
          genes in the present collection can be classified as
          rarely transcribed on the basis of their representation
          by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six or</NUMEX> fewer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ESTs</ENAMEX> among the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 100,000</NUMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis ESTs</ENAMEX> sequenced. Indeed,
          almost <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">17%</NUMEX> of the genes in our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSH</ENAMEX> collection are being
          entered in the 
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Arabidopsis EST</TIMEX> database for the
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time as a result of the present work. It seems
          unlikely that the genes represented on <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the EST</TIMEX> arrays
          used by Maleck 
          et al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] and Desikan 
          et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] comprise an unbiased
          sample of 
          Arabidopsis <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>, as genes
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcribed</ENAMEX> in normal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> and at moderate or high
          levels are more likely to be represented than the rarely,
          but differentially, transcribed genes that dominate the
          stress cDNA collection. In addition, there are
          differences in experimental conditions and in detection
          sensitivity that undoubtedly contribute, but whose
          contribution to different outcomes is difficult to
          assess. But it should also be noted that the overlap
          between microarray datasets generated using the same
          conditions and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> in different <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratories</ENAMEX> can be
          surprisingly low, particularly when different microarray
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">technologies</ENAMEX> are used. Enriched cDNA <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>, such as
          the one we have constructed, may therefore contribute to
          the characterization of the stress transcriptome through
          the construction of standardized specialized arrays.
        
        
          Functional classification of genes represented in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSH</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>
          We were able to assign nearly <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three-quarters</NUMEX> of the
          genes to functional <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> based on sequence similarities
          with known genes or motifs (see Additional data files).
          Although functional assignment based only on sequence
          homology needs experimental verification, it nonetheless
          provides a measure of the diversity of the genes in the
          stress cDNA collection. Genes from all the major
          functional categories are represented in the collection
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>, and see Additional data files).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Genes encoding proteins</ENAMEX> involved in <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX>/defense
          signaling comprise <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13%</NUMEX> of the genes in the collection.
          They include <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes encoding proteins</ENAMEX> involved in signal
          perception (several types of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor kinases</ENAMEX>) and signal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transmission</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein kinases</ENAMEX>, protein
          phosphatases, calcium-binding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>) (see Additional
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> files). <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">About 10%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">79</NUMEX>) in the
          collection were classified as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX>/defense response
          genes. This includes <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes encoding proteins</ENAMEX> of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antioxidant</ENAMEX> response (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GSTs</ENAMEX>, peroxidases), the SAR
          response (pathogenesis-related genes) and cell rescue [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> ] . Genes induced in response to other stresses, such
          as drought [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">51</TIMEX> ] , heat shock [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">52</TIMEX> ] , dehydration [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">53</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">54 55</NUMEX> ] , and elicitors such as 
          Avr9 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">56</TIMEX> ] , 
          avrRpt2 [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">57</TIMEX> ] and harpins [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">58 59</NUMEX>
          ] , were also identified in the stress cDNA collection,
          underscoring the overlap between the different stress
          responses
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Genes encoding proteins</ENAMEX> involved in moving, modifying,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">storing</ENAMEX> and degrading <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> constituted the third
          largest <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12%</NUMEX>) in the stress cDNA collection. Nearly
          half of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">45</NUMEX>) in this category (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">92</NUMEX>) are involved
          in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">proteolysis</TIMEX> (see Additional data files). Proteolysis
          of important regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> is a key aspect of
          cellular regulation in eukaryotes [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60 61</NUMEX> ] and there is
          evidence that the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is
          important in implementation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> defense response
          [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">62 63 64</NUMEX> ] . Proteosome subunit genes are induced in
          response to stresses [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">65 66</NUMEX> ] and several regulatory
          subunits were identified in the stress cDNA collection.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F-box-containing</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> of the SCF complex
          constitute a family of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E3</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">ligases</ENAMEX>, key components of the
          ubiquitin-proteasome pathway [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">67</TIMEX> ] , as are many RING
          finger <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">68</TIMEX> ] . The RING finger motif is thought
          to mediate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-protein interactions</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">E3</ENAMEX> ligase
          complex <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assembly</ENAMEX>. Certain RING finger <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are
          rapidly induced by elicitors in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> and may be involved in
          the rapid degradation of regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> during <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early</TIMEX>
          stages of pathogen attack [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">69</TIMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> encoding

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 70 71 72 73</NUMEX> ] . There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> with a WRKY domain
          in the

          collection. These WRKY transcription factors modulate
          gene expression by binding to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX>-boxes and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">W</ENAMEX>-box-like
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">motifs</ENAMEX>, which are significantly over-represented in the

          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3a</ENAMEX>). The bZIP transcription factors are important
          in the regulation of genes activated by light, UV
          radiation, pathogen attacks, elicitors, wounding,
          abscisic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABA</ENAMEX>) treatment, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SA</ENAMEX> treatment [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47 71</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81</NUMEX> ] . We identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> basic

          helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors in the
          stress cDNA collection. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> of a subset of
          genes in the stress cDNA collection are enriched in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>-box
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGA</ENAMEX> motifs, suggesting that they may be regulated by
          these bZIP and bHLH transcription factors. Identifying
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">insertional</ENAMEX> knock-outs or creating antisense lines for
          these transcription <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor genes</ENAMEX> and using them for
          expression profiling with microarrays constructed from
          the stress cDNA collection will facilitate identification
          of the targets for these transcription factors.
          Abscisic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> response elements (ABREs) are important
          during the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX>'s response to abiotic stresses such as
          dehydration, salinity and cold, all of which are
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABA</ENAMEX>-mediated [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">82 83</NUMEX> ] . There is evidence that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ROS</ENAMEX> are
          involved in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABA</ENAMEX> signaling [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">84</TIMEX> ] . The enrichment of the
          ABRE motif in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter sequences</ENAMEX> of the genes in the
          stress cDNA collection may reflect crosstalk among stress
          signaling pathways mediated by common <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">messengers</ENAMEX>,
          such as H

          genes in the stress cDNA collection, especially those in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX>, further validates the enrichment of the
          stressor-specific genes using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSH</ENAMEX> technique and
          suggests that these genes may be regulated by the changes
          in the levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SA</ENAMEX> that occurs in stress responses [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">85</NUMEX>
          ] .
          The motifs associated with the hormone ethylene
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GCC</ENAMEX>-box and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EIN3</ENAMEX>) were not significantly
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-represented in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> of genes represented in
          the stress cDNA collection. A plausible reason is that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SA</ENAMEX>
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethylene</ENAMEX> act antagonistically to each other [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] .
          The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-representation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SA</ENAMEX>-inducible <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in the
          collection may be correlated with the reduced
          representation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ethylene</ENAMEX>-responsive genes in the
          stress cDNA collection. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Myb1</NUMEX> motif was identified in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Antirrhinum</ENAMEX> . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">86</TIMEX> ] , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Myb2</TIMEX> and
          Myb3 motifs in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Petunia</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">87</TIMEX> ] . These sequences
          have not been verified as valid Myb binding motifs in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> . The
          under-representation of the DRE-like element suggests
          that genes whose expression is modulated by pathogen
          attacks and oxidative stress signaling may have minimal
          overlap with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> involved in dehydration and cold
          responses.
          There is evidence that the H-box motif is involved in
          developmental regulation of flowering, but there is no
          report of its involvement in <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX>/defense responses [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">88 89</NUMEX> ] . However, a combination of the H-box motif and
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX>-box motif has been shown to be important for
          binding of bZIP transcription factors to rapidly induce
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">defense-related genes</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47 90 91</NUMEX> ] . The significant
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-representation of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> motifs together in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter sequences</ENAMEX> of the stress cDNA collection suggests
          that combinatorial interactions between these two 
          cis -elements may also be important
          in the regulation of stress-responsive genes. It is
          becoming increasingly evident that a major theme
          underlying eukaryotic transcriptional regulation is
          combinatorial control [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">92</TIMEX> ] . Identifying the 
          cis -elements and the cognate
          transcription factors that bind to them during <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX> or
          defense responses is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> step towards

          using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PolyTract</ENAMEX> oligo(dT) columns (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Promega</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Madison</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WI</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          Suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSH</ENAMEX> was carried out using the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR-Select</ENAMEX> Subtractive
          Hybridization kit (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Clontech</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Palo Alto</ENAMEX>, CA). Experimental
          and control <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> for each treatment were processed
          simultaneously to reduce false positives. We increased
          the amount of mRNA to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">3-4 g</NUMEX> from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> g recommended by
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX> to compensate for the loss of mRNA
          during the phenol chloroform extractions. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cDNA</ENAMEX> prepared
          from the treated samples was used as the 'tester' and
          that from the control sample as 'driver' for the forward
          subtraction to isolate fragments corresponding to genes
          whose expression level was increased following the
          treatment. The reverse subtraction was carried out with
          the control sample as tester to isolate fragments
          corresponding to genes whose expression level decreased
          following the treatment. The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">PCR</ENAMEX>-based enrichment of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differentially</ENAMEX> expressed sequences depends on the number
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">tester</ENAMEX> molecules with adaptors ligated to their ends.
          If the fraction of tester cDNA with the adaptors was less
          than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX>, ligations were repeated. We designed
          plant-specific glyceraldehyde-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>-phosphate dehydrogenase (
          
          G3PDH ) primers to test the
          ligation efficiency as recommended by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX>. A
          
          G3PDH gene fragment of
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">300</TIMEX> bp was amplified with

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GGTAGGATCGGGAGGAAC; GAPA-R</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GATAACCTTCTTGGCACCAG</ENAMEX>) using
          the adaptor-ligated cDNA as template. The tester cDNA was
          also amplified with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">G3PDH 3</ENAMEX>' primer and an
          adaptor-specific primer, which yields a fragment that is
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> bp bigger than the fragment generated with the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-specific primers. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Samples</ENAMEX> from the

          plant development and plant responses to environmental
          stresses [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 16 70 71 72 73</NUMEX> ] . G-boxes (CACGTG), H-boxes
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CCTACC</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TGA</ENAMEX> motifs (TGACG) are binding sequences for
          bZIP transcription factors, which have an important role
          in the regulation of genes activated by environmental
          cues [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">71 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81</NUMEX> ] . We also tested some
          of the well-characterized stress hormone-responsive
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">motifs</ENAMEX>, including the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABA</ENAMEX>-response element (BACGTGKM) [

          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DRCCGACNW</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">95</TIMEX> ] , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HSE</ENAMEX> (CTNGAANNTTCNA) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">102</ENAMEX> ]
          to determine the extent of overlap in genes activated
          during different stresses.
        
        
          Probability and significance calculations for
          promoter analysis
          To determine whether a particular motif is
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over</NUMEX>-represented among the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> of a given SSH
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">library</ENAMEX>, we first determined the frequency of each motif
          in the total complement of 
          Arabidopsis <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> using the
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,000 bp</NUMEX> upstream <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoter</ENAMEX> files from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TAIR</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">103</ENAMEX> ] . We
          then calculated the probability of finding 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> promoter regions having <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or
          more motifs in the set of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">promoters</ENAMEX> in each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSH</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX>, as
          well as in the total <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SSH</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">library</ENAMEX> collection. We
          considered a motif to be significantly over-represented
          if this probability was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 0.05</NUMEX>. These
          calculations were implemented using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Perl</ENAMEX> scripts that are
          available from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">StresDB</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">104</ENAMEX> ] .
