        Much has been written in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last decade</TIMEX> about the
        potential of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) as a
        new diagnostic and therapeutic tool in clinical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neurophysiology</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TMS</ENAMEX> is a painless and
        non-invasive technique for stimulating cortical tissue by
        means of magnetic induction. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TMS</ENAMEX> has been used to map the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">motor</ENAMEX> cortex by recording evoked responses, and appears to
        show potential for treating certain brain disorders, from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Parkinson's disease</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">depression</ENAMEX>. A disadvantage of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TMS</ENAMEX>,
        however, is its inability to localize the site of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">excitation</ENAMEX> in the brain to a volume <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than several tens</NUMEX>
        of cubic centimeters at best. This is because the spatial
        distribution of the magnetic fields cannot be effectively
        concentrated or focused. In fact, because the fields obey
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Laplace</ENAMEX>'s equation, it is impossible to create local maxima
        in the field intensity no matter what the configuration of
        source coils; in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homogeneous</ENAMEX> conducting medium, the field
        strength will always be largest at the surface and fall off
        monotonically at greater depths.
        In this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>, we propose a different method of
        stimulating cortical tissue, which, in principle, could
        permit much greater localization of the site of excitation
        as well as deeper penetration into the brain. The idea is
        to induce electrical currents by propagating an ultrasonic
        wave in the presence of a strong <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">DC</ENAMEX> magnetic field. The
        currents are generated by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lorentz</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> on moving ions
        produced by the oscillating sound wave. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
        We present here an analysis of the distribution of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electric</ENAMEX> field induced by an ideally collimated ultrasonic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">beam</ENAMEX> in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homogeneous</ENAMEX> conducting medium. The analysis
        allows us to calculate the magnitude of the electric field
        strengths that can be expected, and shows that the highest
        practical fields that can be induced by ultrasound, up to
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 8</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V/m</ENAMEX>, are about an order of magnitude lower than
        those associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TMS</ENAMEX>. Such fields have been reported
        in the literature to range between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 10</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">100 V/m</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>
        ] . We note, however, that the spatial and temporal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> of the ultrasonically-induced fields are quite
        different from those induced by magnetic induction. One
        such difference is that the spatial variations of the
        ultrasonically-induced fields are much more rapid than the
        fields associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TMS</ENAMEX> since, in the former case, the
        fields change on the scale of the ultrasonic wavelength
        (e.g., <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">less than a millimeter</NUMEX>). Thus, the magnitude of the
        gradients of the ultrasonically-induced electric fields can
        be comparable to those associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TMS</ENAMEX>, depending on
        the ultrasonic frequency (e.g., at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHz</ENAMEX>, a gradient of
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 60</NUMEX> kV<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/m 2is</ENAMEX> attainable). This may be significant
        since activation <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> predict that the gradient of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">field</ENAMEX>, rather than its strength, is primarily responsible
        for neural stimulation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7</NUMEX> ] . However, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> have
        also speculated that field gradients induced by
        cellular-scale inhomogeneities in the tissue conductivity
        may play a more important role in neural stimulation than
        the spatial variations of the impressed fields [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9 10 11</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> ] . The latter question is important in deciding whether
        the potentially large impressed field gradients induced by
        ultrasound are truly an advantage in effecting stimulation.
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
        A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> difference between ultrasonic stimulation and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TMS</ENAMEX> that may have some practical significance for exciting
        neural tissue is related to our greater freedom in
        controlling the time dependence of an ultrasonic pulse
        compared to a TMS pulse. We show below that the temporal
        dependence of the electric field (and the induced current
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">density</ENAMEX>) follows that of the ultrasonic waveform. Although
        the duration of a TMS pulse is typically on the order of a
        few <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">tenths of a millisecond</NUMEX> and the ultrasonic variation is
        on the order of microseconds or less (roughly the
        reciprocal of the ultrasonic frequency), considerable
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> over the shape of the ultrasonic waveform is in
        principle possible. For example, one can transmit an
        ultrasonic pulse <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">train</ENAMEX> at essentially any repetition
        frequency or modulate a continuous ultrasonic wave in a
        variety of ways.
        For neural excitation to take place, the magnitude of
        the induced electric field (or its gradient) must exceed an
        activation threshold. It is generally believed that
        excitation that is oscillatory in time makes this process
        more difficult. For example, simulations carried out by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reilly</ENAMEX> suggest that, using a sinusoidal stimulus, the
        activation threshold increases monotonically with frequency
        beyond a few kHz [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . However, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reilly</ENAMEX> also reports that
        a series of rapid pulses, where the repetition period is
        short compared to the depolarization time constant (the
        latter being <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a few tenths of a millisecond</NUMEX>), is a much more
        effective stimulus than a pure sinusoid. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reilly</ENAMEX> describes
        this as the "integration effect of multiple pulses." If the
        individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pulses</ENAMEX> are monophasic, the activation threshold
        is considerably reduced compared to a single monophasic
        pulse. For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reilly</ENAMEX> reports that the integration
        effect of a series of rapid pulses, each <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10 microsec</NUMEX> in
        duration with a repetition rate of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> kHz, reduces the
        activation threshold by a factor of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> relative to a single
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> microsec pulse.
        A key question is whether a series of pulses of this
        kind can be generated ultrasonically. Certainly, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX> kHz
        rate is feasible. A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> question is whether one can
        create an ultrasonic pulse that is approximately
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">monophasic</ENAMEX>. With some ingenuity, the answer appears to be
        yes. For example, although an ultrasonic pulse must have a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">zero DC</ENAMEX> component, the pulse need not be symmetric; that
        is, the positive-going excursion of an ultrasonic pulse
        can, under certain conditions, significantly exceed the
        negative-going excursion, which would approximate a
        "monophasic" waveform. A simple example of the latter can
        be achieved with the aid of an ultrasonic transducer that
        is non-symmetric, e.g., a transducer whose length is much
        greater than its width. In this case, there is a large
        positive excursion followed by a much longer, but weaker,
        negative excursion (an ultrasonic "wake"). Another way to
        alter the shape of an ultrasonic pulse is by transmitting
        it through a dispersive medium that acts as an ultrasonic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">filter</ENAMEX>, or by using multi-layered transducers.
        Although, in our analysis, we shall for simplicity
        assume a static magnetic field, an alternative approach is
        to use an optimally-designed magnetic pulse produced by a
        conventional TMS coil to bring the neural tissue close to
        its activation threshold, but not exceeding it. TMS coils
        create fields, although transient, in the range of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>
        T. An ultrasonic pulse (or series of pulses), if properly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">timed</ENAMEX>, could then push the membrane potential past
        threshold. In this way, the locus of activation would still
        be determined by the ultrasound, although deep stimulation
        might still be difficult because the field intensity
        produced by a TMS coil falls off rapidly with depth (a
        problem avoided by using a static field). It is worth
        noting that the idea of using a conditioning pulse of this
        kind was suggested by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reilly</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] , but in a somewhat
        different context. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reilly</ENAMEX> proposed using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> coils, one
        that produces a "conditioning pulse" (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reilly</ENAMEX>'s phrase) to
        achieve <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">75%</NUMEX> of the excitation threshold; then a second
        nearby coil, excited by a sinusoidal waveform (of frequency
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</NUMEX> kHz in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reilly</ENAMEX>'s example), would push the membrane
        potential beyond threshold. His idea was that the
        combination of coils is more effective in achieving greater
        "focality," or localization, of the stimulus than a single
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">coil</ENAMEX>. Using a mathematical model of neural activation,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reilly</ENAMEX> predicts that this combination of signals, the
        conditioning pulse plus <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the 80 kHz sine</TIMEX> wave, will achieve
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">activation</ENAMEX>. One could speculate that, instead of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</NUMEX> kHz
        sinusoidal signal, the conditioning pulse could be
        accompanied by a series of ultrasonic pulses at a rate of
        <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">80 kHz</TIMEX> (or whatever rate is determined to be optimal). It
        may turn out that these questions can only be settled by
        experiment, or by sophisticated modeling of the neuron in
        the presence of a realistic ultrasonic wave.
      
      
        Method
        
          Concept
          Localized electric currents can be induced in tissue
          by propagating ultrasound in the presence of a magnetic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">field</ENAMEX>. Consider, for example, an ultrasonic pulse
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">propagating</ENAMEX> in an electrolytic fluid (such as soft
          tissue) in the presence of a static magnetic field
          oriented in a direction perpendicular to the propagation
          path. The longitudinal particle motion due to the
          ultrasonic wave moves the ions back and forth through the
          magnetic field; this results in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lorentz</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> on the
          ions that give rise to an electric current density that
          oscillates at the ultrasonic frequency. This idea was
          used as the basis of "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX> effect imaging" proposed by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wen</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lorentz</ENAMEX> forces are employed to image
          the electrical conductivity of tissue. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montalibet et</ENAMEX> al.
          also noted that propagating ultrasound in the presence of
          a magnetic field will generate electric currents in
          tissue [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . They also proposed using this effect to
          measure the electrical conductivity of tissue.
          Here we propose a new application: localized
          stimulation of active (nerve or cortical) tissue by
          ultrasonically-induced electric fields. Our objective in
          this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> is to compute the magnitude and the spatial
          distribution of the these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">fields</ENAMEX>. We shall show that
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">analytical</ENAMEX> solutions for the field distribution can be
          derived for an ideally collimated ultrasonic beam.
        
        
          Theory
          Consider an ion in a conductive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">medium</ENAMEX> with charge 
          q . The longitudinal particle
          motion of an ultrasonic wave will cause the ion to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oscillate</ENAMEX> back and forth in the medium with velocity 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">v</ENAMEX> . In the presence of a constant
          magnetic field, 
          B 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> , the ion is subjected to the
          Lorentz force

          When this current density is substituted into (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">7</ENAMEX>), one

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> (

          Let us evaluate these functions on the beam boundary (

          a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/Œª</ENAMEX>, so that, for 
          a greater than a few wavelengths,
          we can use the large argument asymptotic approximations [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> ] :
          
          which gives

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electric</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">field</ENAMEX>, as seen from (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6</ENAMEX>).
          Several comments about this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solution</ENAMEX> are worth noting.
          First, for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">beam</ENAMEX> with a perfectly (and unrealistically)
          sharp boundary at 
          r = 
          a , the radial component of the
          electric-field gradient is infinite on the boundary. This
          is a mathematical artifact of our <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solution</ENAMEX> since the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electric</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">field</ENAMEX> is discontinuous at 
          r = 
          a . For a real beam, the transition
          is much more gradual (on the order of an ultrasonic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">wavelength</ENAMEX> or more), and charge distribution on the beam
          boundary will be distributed over this transition region.
          A <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> point is that a numerical integration of (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">16</NUMEX>)
          for a more realistic beam profile, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> ( 
          r ), that falls off more smoothly
          than (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">17</NUMEX>), such as a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gaussian</ENAMEX> profile, results in an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electric</ENAMEX> field smaller in magnitude at the beam boundary
          than that given by (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">39</NUMEX>) and (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">40</NUMEX>). Thus, the above
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">analytical</ENAMEX> solution provides a useful, but very
          qualitative, picture of the field behavior at the beam
          boundary. It can also be seen from the expressions
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">22</NUMEX>)-(<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">24</NUMEX>) that the induced field is near <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> at the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">center</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">beam</ENAMEX> ( 
          r = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>). In fact, (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">24</NUMEX>) predicts that
          the 
          z -component of the induced field
          is exactly <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> at 
          r = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> and that the other components
          are very small compared to 
          E 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> at 
          r = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>. The latter statements also
          hold true for a <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Gaussian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">beam</ENAMEX> profile, as a numerical
          integration shows. This is a consequence of the fact that
          
          E 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX> 
           <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arises</ENAMEX> essentially due to charge accumulation in the
          vicinity of the beam boundary. Thus, on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">beam axis</ENAMEX>,
          the total electric field, 
          E 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> + 
          E 
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">s</ENAMEX> 
           , is close to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lorentz</ENAMEX> induced field 
          E 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> .
          We next consider the gradient of the electric field.
          For activation, we are interested in the rate of change
          of the component of the electric field along the
          direction of the axon. If we regard the significant field
          as 
          E 
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">0 only</TIMEX>, then we note that this field
          is perpendicular to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">beam axis</ENAMEX>, while the largest
          component of the gradient points along the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">beam axis</ENAMEX> and
          is given by the derivative of 
          E 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> with respect to 
          z . If the axon is oriented at an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">angle Œ±</ENAMEX> with respect to the beam direction, then the
          component of the electric field along the direction of
          the axon is 
          E 
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">0 sin Œ±</TIMEX>. Now the rate of change of
          this component along the axon direction is the derivative
          of 
          E 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> sin Œ± with respect to the distance
          measured along the axon, which is (

        Results and Discussion
        Here we estimate the peak electric field that can be
        safely induced using ultrasound at the upper range of
        diagnostic intensities. A key parameter in computing the
        field strength is the particle velocity generated by the
        ultrasonic wave. The peak particle velocity, 
        v 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> , can be related to the peak pressure,
        
        p 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> , of the wave using the relation
        
        where œÅ is the tissue density and 
        c 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">0</ENAMEX> is the sound speed. Measurements
        performed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Duck</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> modern commercial
        ultrasonographic scanners have demonstrated instantaneous
        peak pressures in excess of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> MPa at the focal point of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transducer</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>(Although this pressure translates into an
        intensity that considerably exceeds the 
        temporally-averaged <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> limit of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.7</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">W/cm 2for</ENAMEX> diagnostic systems, the instantaneous intensities
        are generally far higher than the latter value.)
        Using the values of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p</ENAMEX> and 
        c 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, the above formula gives a
        peak particle velocity, 
        v 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> , of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.67</NUMEX> m/s. To estimate the
        magnitude of 
        E 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> for a typical set of parameters, we
        assume a magnetic field strength of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tesla</ENAMEX>, which is
        typical of whole body MRI magnets. This gives 
        E 
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0</TIMEX> = 4 V/m. The electric field strength
        can, of course, be enhanced by increasing the magnetic
        field 
        B 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> . Although <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T</ENAMEX> is a typical MRI
        field strength, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">T</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">systems</ENAMEX> have recently become available.
        This field strength would double the peak electric field to
        
        E 
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0</TIMEX> = 8 V/m. It may be worth noting that a
        high-field magnet with a smaller bore designed to
        accommodate only the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX> would be much less costly than
        the whole-body machines with much larger bore diameters. In
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">general</ENAMEX>, smaller bore magnets are also more suitable for
        high-field applications. Finally, the very high magnetic
        field homogeneity needed for imaging is not required in
        this application, which would further reduce costs.
        We next estimate the maximum gradient of the electric
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">field</ENAMEX>, given <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> by 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> 
        E 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0 /2</NUMEX>. The particle velocity quoted above
        was measured for an instrument operating at an ultrasonic
        frequency of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHz</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . Using 
        E 
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0</TIMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V/m</ENAMEX>, we obtain an electric field
        gradient of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> 
        E 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0 /2</NUMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">67</NUMEX> kV<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">/m 2at</ENAMEX> this frequency. This
        is of the same order of magnitude of the activation
        thresholds computed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsu</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Durand</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] .
      
      
        Conclusion
        Although the strength of the ultrasonically-induced
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electric</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">fields</ENAMEX> is about an order of magnitude below that
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TMS</ENAMEX> generated fields, there are differences in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">spatial</ENAMEX> and temporal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">character</ENAMEX> of these <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">fields</ENAMEX> that may
        have some practical consequences. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> point is that
        the ultrasonically-induced electric field gradients are
        comparable to typical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TMS</ENAMEX> gradients, because the
        ultrasonically-induced fields pass from maximum to minimum
        in a much shorter distance, i.e., <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately half</NUMEX> the
        ultrasonic wavelength (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a fraction of a millimeter</NUMEX>). A
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> point is that one can exercise greater control over
        the temporal shape of the ultrasonically-induced electric
        fields compared to TMS-induced fields. For example, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">excitation</ENAMEX> can be oscillatory ("polyphasic") or not
        (approximately "monophasic," with a sharp upgoing excursion
        followed by a weaker, but longer negative going excursion).
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pulses</ENAMEX> can be applied in very rapid sequence, or a
        continuous wave can be modulated in a variety of ways.
        We also mentioned the possibility of using a
        conventional TMS coil to generate a strong, but transient,
        magnetic field that could be applied during the
        transmission of the ultrasound. That is, the function of
        the TMS pulse would be to bring the membrane potential near
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">threshold</ENAMEX>, but not to exceed it. The ultrasonic pulse (or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pulses</ENAMEX>) would then push the potential past threshold. One
        could speculate that near threshold, where the membrane
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">nonlinearity</ENAMEX> is strong, a sinusoidal stimulus may be
        effective in achieving activation due to some partial
        rectification of the sinusoid [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] .
        We conclude by noting that the same technique could be
        used in principle to stimulate any type of excitable
        tissue, not just cortical tissue, including, for example,
        peripheral nerve tissue. Finally, it may turn out that the
        ultrasonically-induced fields are simply too weak for
        effective stimulation, although this remains to be
        established. Answers to these questions may have to await
        experimental work or further modeling of the
        electrophysiology of neural activation.

        to an excellent approximation, (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">A8</NUMEX>) may be replaced by:
        
        We now argue that the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> term on the right-hand side
        of (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">A7</NUMEX>) is much smaller than the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> term. In fact, the
        magnitude of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> term is smaller than the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> term
        by a factor of the order <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">(Œª/Œ¥</ENAMEX>) <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, where Œª is the ultrasonic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">wavelength</ENAMEX> and Œ¥ is the electromagnetic skin depth in
        tissue. This can be demonstrated rigorously for the case of
        the ideally-collimated ultrasonic beam treated in the main
        text, but a plausibility argument can be given as follows.
        The term ( ¬∑ 
        A ) in (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">A7</NUMEX>) indicates terms that are
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> derivatives of the spatial dependence of the
        ultrasonic <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">beam</ENAMEX>, which will be of the order 
        A . Then the ratio of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> term in
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">A7</NUMEX>) to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> term is œâŒº 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">0 œÉ/ = Œª 2/</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2œÄ 2Œ¥ 2</ENAMEX>), where is the skin
        depth and Œª = <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2œÄ/</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">k</ENAMEX> 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">0</ENAMEX> is the ultrasonic wavelength. At an
        ultrasonic frequency of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHz</ENAMEX>, this ratio is on the order
        of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 -6</NUMEX>. Thus, neglecting the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> term in (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">A7</NUMEX>), we
        have
        
        Next, substituting (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">12</NUMEX>) into (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">A9</NUMEX>), we see that the only
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">non-zero</ENAMEX> component of 
        A is its 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">y</ENAMEX> -component, i.e., 
        A = 
        A 
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">y</ENAMEX> 
         , so that (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">A9</NUMEX>) becomes on writing the variables in
        cylindrical coordinates:

        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION"><</ENAMEX> is the smaller of

        1Fry appears to have been the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> to propose
        using ultrasound to stimulate the brain, although by means
        of a very different mechanism [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . His idea was to
        transmit ultrasound in the presence of an oscillating
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electric</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">field</ENAMEX> of the same frequency. The periodic
        variation of the electrical conductivity of the tissue
        created by the slight variation in thermal expansion
        arising from the oscillating sound wave would, in
        principle, produce a partial rectification of the applied
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">field</ENAMEX>, resulting in a small amount of unidirectional
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electric</ENAMEX> current. The resulting unidirectional charge
        transfer, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fry</ENAMEX> speculated, could stimulate neural tissue.
        However, to succeed, the method requires extremely intense
        ultrasonic pulses (from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 to 50</NUMEX> kW<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">/cm 2</ENAMEX>) and a very strong
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electric</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">field</ENAMEX> (producing current densities on the order of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">amps/cm 2</ENAMEX>). As far as this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">author</ENAMEX> is aware, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fry</ENAMEX>'s method
        has not been tried.
        2A great deal has been written on the subject of what
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">temporal</ENAMEX> and spatial features of the stimulating fields are
        responsible for activation. Early work by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rattay</ENAMEX> suggested
        that the "activation function," essentially the gradient of
        the electric field along the axis of the axon, is a key
        contributor [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . Other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> pointed out that this
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gradient</ENAMEX> is determined not only by the variations in the
        impressed field, but also by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">conductance</TIMEX> variations in the
        axon due to bends, terminations and other departures from a
        straight line that may perturb the local boundary
        conditions. Also, the shape and duration of the stimulating
        pulse play an important role. It has been noted that the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> and space dependence of the activating function
        mutually interact in a way that may make the effects of
        each difficult to treat independently [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 14</NUMEX> ] .
        3Note that we are assuming that the maximum intensity
        occurs at the focal point of the transducer. This is
        generally true if the ultrasound is sufficiently focused,
        but may not be true for a 
        weakly focused transducer when the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">beam</ENAMEX> passes through an intervening medium that is very
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">attenuating</ENAMEX> (such as the skull).
