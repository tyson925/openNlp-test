        Elastase-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emphysema</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rodents</ENAMEX> is the most widely
        studied animal model for human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">emphysema</ENAMEX>. Several
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alterations</ENAMEX> in diaphragmatic structure and function have
        been demonstrated in this <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>. Among these are diaphragm
        fiber shortening with a corresponding shift in the
        length-tension curve [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3 4 5</NUMEX> ] and variable changes in
        the contractile <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">properties</ENAMEX> of diaphragm strips 
        in vitro [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3 5 6</NUMEX> ] . Increased
        fatigue resistance of the muscle is the single alteration
        in contractile properties that has been most consistently [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3 6</NUMEX> ] , though not always [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] , identified. This
        fatigue <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">resistance</ENAMEX> has been accompanied by an increased
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">oxidative</ENAMEX> capacity in the diaphragmatic muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> as
        demonstrated by increased activities of citrate synthase [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8</NUMEX> ] and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3</NUMEX> ] .
        In contrast, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber</ENAMEX> type has generally not been found to
        be significantly altered in the diaphragms of emphysematous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3 8</NUMEX> ] , although in all reports addressing
        this issue the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> were typed histochemically rather
        than by myosin heavy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> (MHC) composition. Furthermore,
        the kinetics of diaphragmatic muscle contraction that one
        would expect to result from shifts in fiber type
        distribution, such as time to peak tension, have also
        generally [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3 6 9</NUMEX> ] , but not always [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] , been found
        to be unaltered in emphysema. A change in fiber type
        distribution in the diaphragm of emphysematous hamsters was
        shown for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time recently [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] , but again
        histochemical classification was employed, and no
        corresponding change in twitch kinetics was demonstrated.
        In the scalene muscle, an accessory muscle of inspiration,
        of emphysematous hamsters, an increase in IIa <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> and a
        decrease in IIx <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> has been demonstrated with the use
        of anti-MHC monoclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX>. There was no difference,
        however, in contractile properties between emphysema and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> muscle in that study [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] .
        In <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>, our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> other have demonstrated
        marked alterations in MHC expression in the diaphragm in
        severe emphysema [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13</NUMEX> ] . This shift toward slow MHC
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">isoforms</ENAMEX> has been proposed to subserve an adaptive
        resistance to fatigue in the human diaphragm in emphysema
        which is similar to that seen in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> model.
        Although most of the experimental work on adaptation of
        the diaphragm to emphysema has been performed in hamsters,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> also develop significant and often marked increases in
        lung volumes and compliance, and reductions in expiratory
        flows, after intratracheal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">elastase</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16 17 18</NUMEX> ] . MHC adaptation in emphysematous rat
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diaphragm</ENAMEX> has not been studied systematically. Because
        monoclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MHC antibodies</ENAMEX> are better characterized in rat
        than hamster, and with the availability of a
        semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain
        reaction (RT-PCR) assay for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> MHC mRNA [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] , we set
        out to study changes in MHC-determined fiber <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">types</ENAMEX> and MHC
        mRNA expression in emphysematous <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat diaphragm</ENAMEX>. To evaluate
        whether shifts toward more energy-efficient isoforms of the
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> most important <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATPase</ENAMEX> in muscle might also occur in
        emphysematous diaphragm, we also studied changes in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic-</ENAMEX>reticulum Ca <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>+-ATPase (SERCA)
        expression.
        Further, we sought to correlate changes in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHC</ENAMEX> and SERCA
        expression with the physiologic function of diaphragm
        strips 
        in vitro . We hypothesized that we
        would identify significant alterations in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHC</ENAMEX> (and perhaps
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SERCA</ENAMEX>) expression in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">emphysematous rat</ENAMEX> diaphragm
        similar to those identified in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> with severe
        emphysema, and that these changes would be accompanied by
        corresponding changes in contractile properties. It was
        expected that such findings might identify the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> model of
        elastase-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emphysema</ENAMEX> as a model in which the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diaphragmatic MHC</ENAMEX> changes that have been shown to result
        from emphysema in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> might be explored further.

          emphysema induction by a single intratracheal
          instillation of porcine pancreatic elastase (ICN
          Biochemicals, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cleveland</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX>) at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">units</ENAMEX> per <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> g body
          weight, diluted in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.60</NUMEX> ml of normal saline as described
          previously [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> died on <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the night</TIMEX> after
          instillation, with evidence at autopsy <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the following day</TIMEX>
          of diffuse pulmonary hemorrhage.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Eleven</NUMEX> control <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> were instilled with an equal
          volume of saline without a mortality.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Animals</ENAMEX> were maintained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> per cage with feeding 
          ad libitum for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 months</TIMEX>. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">protocol</ENAMEX> was approved by the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Animal Care Committees of</ENAMEX>
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philadelphia Veterans Affairs Medical Center</ENAMEX> and the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Pennsylvania</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Diaphragm <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">strip physiology</ENAMEX> in vitro
          An apparatus for the study 
          in vitro of muscle contractile
          characteristics similar to that described previously [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>
          ] was assembled. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Thirteen-month-old rats</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 months</TIMEX> after
          the induction of emphysema) were killed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CO</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> inhalation and the diaphragm was
          quickly harvested en bloc with the ribcage intact and
          immersed in oxygenated <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ringer</ENAMEX>'s solution buffered to pH
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.4</NUMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> mM <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-(<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2-hydroxyethyl</ENAMEX>)-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>-piperazine
          ethanesulphonic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>. A muscle strip <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 7.5</NUMEX> mm
          in width, including central tendon and rib <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">attachments</ENAMEX>,
          was dissected out under magnification; care was taken to
          cut parallel to the muscle <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX>.
          Each <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">strip</ENAMEX> was mounted horizontally in a bath of
          continuously circulating, oxygenated solution at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX> Â±
          1Â°C. One end of the strip was tied to a fixed post with
          sutures taken through the attached ribs. The central
          tendon at the other end was fixed to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> of a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">servomotor</ENAMEX> system (motor <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6450</TIMEX>, electronics model
          300B; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cambridge</ENAMEX> Technology, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Watertown</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Massachusetts</ENAMEX>) on
          a movable platform with a single tie. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Platinum</ENAMEX> electrodes
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">each 7 mm Ã— 25 mm</NUMEX>) were placed within <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 mm</NUMEX> of the muscle
          strip on either side. The muscles were stimulated with a
          Grass S44 stimulator (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grass Instruments</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Quincy</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Massachusetts</ENAMEX>) with pulses <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.5</NUMEX> times above those needed
          to achieve maximal twitch <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">force</ENAMEX> (120 V, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5 ms pulses</ENAMEX>). A
          series of twitches generated every <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 seconds</TIMEX> at
          incrementally different muscle lengths was used to
          identify the point of maximal force <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">generation</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">o</ENAMEX> ). Mean muscle length at 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">o</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2.68 Â± 0.09 cm</NUMEX> in control
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2.21 Â± 0.07 cm</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> with emphysema ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.001</NUMEX>).
          A length-tension curve was generated from the mean of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> twitches at each muscle length <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">between 70% and 120%</NUMEX>
          of the previously determined 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">L</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">o</ENAMEX> . Fatiguing characteristics were
          then determined by repeated stimulation at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hz</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX>
          ms bursts, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">90</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">trains</ENAMEX>/min. Muscle length (servomotor
          position), stimulator pulse timing, and data collection
          were under computer control with custom software
          developed in our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX>. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Pentium</ENAMEX> computer with a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> acquisition <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">board</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">DT21</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EZ; Data Translation</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marlboro</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Massachusetts</ENAMEX>) controlled the experiment and
          recorded all data to disk for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later</TIMEX> analysis.
          After study, the strip was removed from the apparatus,
          trimmed of nonmuscle tissue, blotted dry, and weighed.
          Total muscle strip cross-sectional area was calculated as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">wet</ENAMEX> muscle mass divided by muscle length times density
          (taken to be <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.06</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g/cm</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] ). Tension was calculated
          by dividing developed force by the calculated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">cross-sectional</ENAMEX> area. Study of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of the control rat
          strips suffered technical failure, leaving <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">emphysematous</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> control <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> fully studied.
          Mean strip wet weight was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.092 Â± 0.004 g</NUMEX> in the control
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.088 Â± 0.003 g</NUMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">emphysematous rats</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.51</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Lung volume determination
          After we had dissected out the diaphragm strips for
          the physiologic studies described above, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>'
          lungs were excised with trachea intact. The trachea was
          cannulated with a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> g intravenous catheter (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Angiocath</ENAMEX>;
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Becton Dickinson</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sandy</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Utah</ENAMEX>), an airtight seal was
          established, and the lung was inflated to a distending
          pressure of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> cmH 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 O.</ENAMEX> This volume (at the total lung
          capacity) was then measured by water displacement.
        
        
          MHC RT-PCR
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHC</ENAMEX> mRNA expression was analyzed by an MHC RT-PCR
          assay as described initially [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] and later adapted by
          its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">originators</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . The assay is semi-quantitative,
          permitting accurate determination of relative amounts of
          mRNA of the embryonic, neonatal, I, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIa</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIx</ENAMEX>, and IIb MHC
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">isoforms</ENAMEX> in muscle. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">assay</ENAMEX>'s accuracy has been
          confirmed against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northern</ENAMEX> blot analysis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] .
          In brief, mRNA was extracted from an <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 50</NUMEX>
          mg fragment of frozen diaphragm taken from the central
          portion of the strip used in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">physiologic</ENAMEX> experiments
          described above. This was done with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Micro</ENAMEX>-fast Track
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">2.0 Kit</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Invitrogen</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Carlsbad</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>) in accordance
          with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">manufacturer</ENAMEX>'s protocol. The mRNA was then
          suspended in <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 Î¼l</NUMEX> of elution buffer and the
          concentration was determined by measuring the attenuance
          at a wavelength of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">260</NUMEX> nm. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mRNA</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">150 ng</NUMEX>) was reverse
          transcribed for each muscle sample with the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</NUMEX>-strand
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">cDNA Synthesis Kit</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amersham Pharmacia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Piscataway</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jersey</ENAMEX>), and the cDNA product was then used in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX>.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) involved <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> reaction tubes for each
          muscle sample, one tube for each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">isoform</ENAMEX> studied. A
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">single 5</ENAMEX>' oligonucleotide common primer, designed from a
          highly conserved region in all known <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> MHC genes
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">500</TIMEX> base pairs upstream of the stop codon,
          was used in every reaction tube (sequence
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>'-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">AGAAGGAGCAGGACACCAGC-3</ENAMEX>'). A different <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3</TIMEX>'
          oligonucleotide primer, designed from a divergent portion
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'-untranslated region of each of the different
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MHC genes</ENAMEX>, was used in each reaction tube to provide
          isoform specificity (sequences in [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 22</NUMEX> ] ). Template,
          in addition to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 Î¼g</NUMEX> of reverse transcribed cDNA, included
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 pg</TIMEX> of an internal control fragment [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] to be
          coamplified with each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> by using the same primers and
          target sequences. However, this control template yields a
          fragment of different size from that resulting from
          amplification of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> in each tube [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>), and permits controlling for the efficiency of each
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> amplification.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> was performed in a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 Î</NUMEX>¼l total reaction
          volume. This mixture contained the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> templates
          described above, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 Î¼l</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 Ã—</NUMEX> PCR buffer (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Promega</ENAMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4 Î</NUMEX>¼l
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> mM MgCl 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 Î¼l</NUMEX> dNTP, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1 Î¼M</NUMEX> of each of the two
          appropriate primers, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> units of DNA 
          Taq polymerase (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Promega</ENAMEX>), with
          water to bring it to final volume. Amplifications were
          performed in a thermal cycler with an initial denaturing
          step of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 minutes</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">96Â°C</TIMEX>, followed by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cycles</ENAMEX>, with
          each cycle consisting of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 minute</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">96Â°C</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">50 seconds</TIMEX> at
          60Â°C, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">50 seconds</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">70Â°C</TIMEX>, and a final step of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">3 minutes</TIMEX>
          at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">72Â°C</TIMEX>. The number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cycles</ENAMEX> was optimized so that the
          amplified signal was on the linear portion of a
          semilogarithmic plot of the yield expressed as a function
          of the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">cycles</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> products were separated
          on <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.0%</NUMEX> agarose gels and stained with ethidium bromide
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
          Negative images of the gels were produced under
          ultraviolet light with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Polaroid</ENAMEX> film type <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">665</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ISO 80/20</ENAMEX>,

          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Massachusetts</ENAMEX>). Densitometry of the bands was performed
          on the negatives (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Personal Densitometer; Molecular</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dynamics</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sunnyvale</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX>) with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Image Quant</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">software</ENAMEX>'s 'area <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">quantitation</ENAMEX>' paradigm. To correct for
          any differences in the efficiency of the reactions for
          each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">isoform</ENAMEX>, the intensity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> was divided
          by the intensity of the control fragment in that
          reaction. A correction factor was calculated for each
          band on the basis of its size, to normalize the intensity
          of the staining for the different sizes of the fragments.
          The final percentage content of each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> in the
          total sample was then calculated from the fraction of a
          specific corrected value relative to the sum of expressed
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHC</ENAMEX> mRNA isoforms in a given sample [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] . We performed
          the reverse transcription and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> in triplicate for
          each piece of muscle, starting with the same mRNA sample.
          The final value represents the mean of these three
          runs.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHC</ENAMEX> immunocytochemistry
          Fiber <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">types</ENAMEX> were determined by indirect
          immunofluorescence on serial frozen cross sections of rat
          diaphragm with monoclonal antibodies specific for the
          following MHCs: NOQ7<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.5.4</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> for type I [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SC-71</ENAMEX> for
          type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IIa</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BF-F3</ENAMEX> for type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IIb</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] . The
          antibody useful for the identification of type IIx
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BF-35</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] , stains all <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> except pure IIx
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX>. To aid in the visualization of the periphery of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX>, we simultaneously co-incubated each section
          with a rabbit <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">anti-</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat laminin</ENAMEX> primary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">St Louis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Missouri</ENAMEX>) at a dilution of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>:<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2500</TIMEX>, followed by
          a fluorescein-conjugated <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">sheep anti-rabbit</ENAMEX> IgG secondary
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX>. Our tissue preparation and staining protocols
          for the type I and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IIa antibodies</ENAMEX> have been described
          previously [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 25</NUMEX> ] , with the modification that
          NOQ7<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.5.4</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> was used at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1:500 dilution</TIMEX>, the section was
          incubated with each of these primary antibodies for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4Â°C</TIMEX>, and rhodamine-conjugated secondary
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> were used. For <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BF-F3</ENAMEX> we used a primary
          antibody dilution of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1:50</TIMEX>, an <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">18 hour</TIMEX> incubation, and a
          donkey anti-mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IgM rhodamine</ENAMEX>-conjugated secondary
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX>. For <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BF-35</ENAMEX> we used a primary antibody dilution
          of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1:10</TIMEX>, a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hour</TIMEX> incubation, and a goat anti-mouse IgG
          rhodamine-conjugated secondary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Fibers</ENAMEX> were classified on the basis of the antibody
          that yielded the strongest fluorescent staining (or the
          absence of staining with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BF-35</ENAMEX> for pure <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IIx fibers</ENAMEX>).
          Thus, we did not assess the proportions of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> that
          might have coexpressed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHC</ENAMEX>. Subjectively,
          we saw no evidence of coexpression of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber</ENAMEX> types I and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIa</ENAMEX>, but owing to the nature of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BF-35</ENAMEX>, which
          stains all except pure <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IIx fibers</ENAMEX>, we are unable to rule
          out the coexpression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIx</ENAMEX> with any other isoform. There
          were very rare <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 1%</NUMEX>) that stained only
          lightly with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BF-F3</ENAMEX> and did not stain with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">BF-35</ENAMEX>. We
          interpreted these as probably representing intermediate
          fibers expressing both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIb</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIx</ENAMEX>. We did not count
          these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> toward the totals reported in the results
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">section</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">At least 500</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> were evaluated for each specimen
          in determining the percentage of each MHC-determined
          fiber type. Using software that had been custom-designed
          in our laboratory we also determined the percentage of
          the total surface area of each cross section of muscle
          occupied by each MHC-determined fiber type.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SERCA</ENAMEX> immunocytochemistry
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Mouse IgG</ENAMEX> monoclonal antibodies directed against the
          slow and fast isoforms of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SERCA</ENAMEX>, respectively, were also
          used on serial sections of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat diaphragm</ENAMEX> (catalogue
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">numbers MA3-91</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MA3-911</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Affinity BioReagents, Inc.</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Golden</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colorado</ENAMEX>). Each section was preincubated with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2%</NUMEX>
          bovine serum albumin for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 hour</TIMEX>, then incubated overnight
          at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">4Â°C</NUMEX> with the appropriate primary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1:500</ENAMEX>
          dilution. A goat anti-mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IgG</ENAMEX> secondary antibody
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conjugated</ENAMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cy3</TIMEX> was used at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1:200 dilution</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 hour</TIMEX>,
          regardless of which primary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> was used.
        
        
          Statistical analysis
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> are reported as means Â± <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SE</ENAMEX>. We used a
          repeated-measures analysis of variance with a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Huynh</ENAMEX>-Feldt
          correction to compare emphysematous and control groups
          with respect to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHC</ENAMEX> transcript levels by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> and
          MHC-determined fiber-type number by immunocytochemistry.
          We noted a group-by-type interaction and then performed 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> -tests to compare the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> groups
          with respect to each of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHC</ENAMEX> isoforms. Fatigue data
          were analyzed by 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> -test comparing mean values of
          measured to initial force ratio. A 
          P value of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX> or less was
          considered to represent statistical significance.
        
      
      
        Results
        
          Lung volume
          We determined H 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> displacement lung volumes at total
          lung capacity (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> cmH 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> airway pressure) as the simplest
          measure to document the hyperexpansion characteristic of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">emphysema</ENAMEX> in the elastase-treated <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>. Because there
          was very little difference in body mass between control
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">emphysematous animals</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">613 Â± 15</NUMEX> g control, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">629 Â± 11 g emphysema,</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>; 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.42</NUMEX>), the differences in lung
          volume were highly significant whether or not they were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">normalized</ENAMEX> to body mass. Crude lung volumes were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34.2</NUMEX> Â±
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.6</NUMEX> ml in emphysematous <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">25.3 Â± 0.3 ml</NUMEX> in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">controls animals</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>) ( 
          P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.0001</NUMEX>). Thus, H 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> displacement lung volumes were
          increased by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35%</NUMEX> in emphysematous <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> over
          controls.
        
        
          Measurement of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHC</ENAMEX> isoform expression by
          RT-PCR
          The mean percentage compositions of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mRNA</ENAMEX> representing
          each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHC</ENAMEX> isoform in the diaphragms of emphysematous and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> are listed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>. Note that there
          was a significant decrease in the expression of MHC IIb
          in emphysematous versus control. Although the increase in
          the expression of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> slower adult <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">isoforms</ENAMEX> did not
          reach statistical significance for any individual
          isoform, all demonstrated a trend to greater expression
          in emphysema. This trend was most marked in the IIx
          isoform, for which the 
          P value for increased expression in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">emphysematous</ENAMEX> versus control diaphragm reached <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.06</NUMEX>.
          Thus, there was modest shift toward expression of slower
          isoforms at the mRNA level, and this shift occurred
          predominantly at the faster end of the MHC spectrum.
        
        
          Measurement of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHC</ENAMEX> isoform expression by
          immunocytochemistry
          Immunocytochemical results measuring MHC
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-determined fiber type closely mirrorred the PCR
          results at the mRNA level. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2demonstrates</ENAMEX> that, as
          determined by immunocytochemistry, emphysematous animals
          had a significantly lower percentage of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> classified
          as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIb</ENAMEX> and a trend toward increased numbers of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIx</ENAMEX> and
          slow <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX>. When calculated on the basis of area
          occupied by each fiber type, the difference between
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">emphysema</ENAMEX> and control did not reach significance even for
          the IIb <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.06</NUMEX>). Note that although the
          results with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> and immunocytochemistry are
          qualitatively similar, they are quantitatively different.
          Figure 2shows a typical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> from serial sections of one
          of the emphysematous diaphragm specimens stained with
          each of the monoclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          SERCA expression by immunocytochemistry
          There was no significant difference in the numbers of
          fibers expressing either <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SERCA 1</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">SERCA 2</NUMEX> between the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">emphysematous</ENAMEX> and control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. For <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">SERCA 1</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">62.4%</NUMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> were positive in controls and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">63.3%</NUMEX> in the
          emphysematous <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">57</NUMEX>). For <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">SERCA 2</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">38.9%</NUMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> were positive in each group ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.99</NUMEX>).
        
        
          In vitrostrip physiology
          The results of the diaphragm strip physiological
          studies are detailed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>. It is notable that the
          physiological parameters that have previously been most
          strongly correlated with a shift to slower MHC isoforms
          (time to peak tension, and fatiguing characteristics)
          were significantly altered in the expected direction in
          the emphysematous versus control diaphragm strips. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Time</ENAMEX>
          to peak tension was longer in the emphysematous group
          with a 
          P value of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.015</NUMEX>, and the
          emphysematous diaphragm was less fatiguable with a 
          P value of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.023</NUMEX>. There was no
          significant difference in specific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">force</ENAMEX> generated or in
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> relaxation time.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        To our knowledge, these data are the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> report of
        significant changes in MHC expression with corresponding
        physiologic alterations in any respiratory muscle of an
        animal model of emphysema. These changes are qualitatively
        similar to those reported in severe human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">emphysema</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13</NUMEX>
        ] : that is, they too are manifested as a shift toward
        slower MHC isoforms. Quantitatively, however, the changes
        are far less marked than the shift demonstrated in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>.
        The most studied animal model for the adaptation of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">respiratory</ENAMEX> muscle to emphysema has been the hamster with
        elastase-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emphysema</ENAMEX>. The hamster <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> has probably
        been chosen for these studies in large part because of the
        impressive increases in lung volumes that can be created in
        hamsters, with total lung capacity sometimes reaching <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">200%</NUMEX>
        of control values. Despite the demonstration of length
        adaptation [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3 4 6</NUMEX> ] and fatigue resistance [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3 6</NUMEX> ]
        in the diaphragms of emphysematous hamsters, not until very
        recently could a change in fiber type distribution be
        demonstrated [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] , and in that study histochemical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">classification</ENAMEX> was employed that could not separate out IIx
        from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIb</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX>. Furthermore, no study in emphysematous
        hamster diaphragm has demonstrated a change in twitch
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">kinetics</ENAMEX>.
        Intratracheal instillation of elastase in rats creates a
        form of panacinar emphysema that in some ways more closely
        parallels the human disease than that created by
        instillation of elastase in hamsters. Changes in lung
        volumes and compliance in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> are more similar to those
        seen in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 15 16 17 18</NUMEX> ] . An electron microscopic
        comparison of human emphysema with elastase-induced
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">emphysema</ENAMEX> in rats revealed remarkably similar pictures of
        elastin disintegration accompanied by increased collagen
        deposition and reorganization [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] .
        Our results for MHC expression in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat diaphragm</ENAMEX> from
        normal and emphysematous <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> must be viewed <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> in the
        light of previous quantitative studies of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHC</ENAMEX> expression in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">normal rat diaphragm</ENAMEX> that used techniques able to separate
        out all known isoforms. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7-9-week-old</TIMEX> Sprague-Dawley
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX>, Kanbara 
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] found by 
        in situ hybridization that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.0%</NUMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">fibers</ENAMEX> expressed only <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIb</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.8%</NUMEX> coexpressed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIx</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIb</ENAMEX> isoforms. This is in contrast with our RT-PCR result of
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">21.6%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIb</ENAMEX> in normals, but immunocytochemical results much
        more in line with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kanbara</ENAMEX>'s findings. In that study, the
        values for <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">MHCs I, IIa</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIx</ENAMEX> were not markedly different
        from those reported here for normal <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> diaphragm by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX>. By electrophoretic separation, Sugiura 
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] found <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIb MHC</ENAMEX> to
        represent <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6.1%</NUMEX> of all <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MHC protein</ENAMEX> in young <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat diaphragm</ENAMEX>,
        and their <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">IId</ENAMEX>/IIx result of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">44.9%</NUMEX> is also quite different
        from our PCR result, while their I and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIa</ENAMEX> findings are
        very similar to our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> results, and their <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">IId</ENAMEX>/IIx result
        closely parallels our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIx</ENAMEX> area percentage
        immunocytochemistry result. Okumoto 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX> reported even less <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IIb</ENAMEX> and
        more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IId protein</ENAMEX> by electrophoresis in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5-month-old</TIMEX> rats [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX> ] .
        The differences between the findings of these reports
        and ours might at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> glance result from the age of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> studied, as our <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rats</ENAMEX> were significantly older at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX>. However, it has been reported that there is an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">age-related</ENAMEX> transition from fast to slow <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHC</ENAMEX> in rat limb
        muscles [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30 31</NUMEX> ] and diaphragm [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] , which would render
        this explanation unlikely. A potential explanation of our
        results in relation to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kanbara's</ENAMEX> would be that there was a
        systematically greater concentration of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIb</ENAMEX> mRNA in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIb</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIb/IIx</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> than of other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">isoforms</ENAMEX>' mRNAs in their
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">respective fibers</ENAMEX>. Sugiura 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX> and Okumoto 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">et al. used Wistar rats</ENAMEX>, although
        this would be unlikely to explain the difference between
        their findings and ours. In the final analysis, it is
        difficult to draw any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">firm</ENAMEX> conclusions from comparisons
        between studies addressing mRNA levels and those addressing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> levels; and similarly between techniques measuring
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> by gel and those measuring <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunocytochemistry</ENAMEX>.
        Although increased activities of citrate synthase [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ]
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SDH</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3</NUMEX> ] have usually been demonstrated in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diaphragm</ENAMEX> in animal models of emphysema, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fiber</ENAMEX> type has
        generally not been found to be significantly altered [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 7</NUMEX> ] . Only in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">one recent</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> was a shift in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHC</ENAMEX> in
        emphysematous diaphragm demonstrated, but the histochemical
        technique used precluded the separation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIb</ENAMEX> and IIx
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . Another study has shown increased
        expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIa</ENAMEX> at the expense of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIx MHC</ENAMEX> in
        emphysematous hamster scalene muscle with the use of MHC
        monoclonal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX>, but there were none of the expected
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">physiologic</ENAMEX> changes accompanying the shift [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] .
        We demonstrate here a shift from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIb</ENAMEX> toward <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIx</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">emphysematous</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> diaphragm at both the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> and mRNA
        levels. Although this shift toward a slower isoform is not
        as marked as that reported in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13</NUMEX> ] , in which
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHC</ENAMEX> type I is upregulated and both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIa</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIx</ENAMEX> are
        downregulated, there is precedent for restricted MHC
        adaptation in rats. Termin 
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] for example, have noted
        that whereas chronically stimulated rabbit fast-twitch
        muscle results in appreciable increases in slow myosin
        isoforms, chronic stimulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> muscle tends to bring
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about</NUMEX> shifts toward the slower types among the type II
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">isoforms</ENAMEX>. Other factors that might lead to less impressive
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHC</ENAMEX> shifts in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">rodent</TIMEX> models of emphysema than in humans
        include the much shorter time course over which the
        adaptations have a chance to occur, the greater compliance
        of the rodent thorax to pulmonary hyperexpansion, and
        differences in the diaphragmatic load created in the human
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> in comparison with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animal</ENAMEX> models that have yet
        to be fully worked out.
        Our finding in the diaphragms of rats with emphysema is
        very similar to that demonstrated by Sugiura 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX> in the diaphragms of
        chronically swimming rats [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] . We found <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIb</ENAMEX> mRNA
        expression to decrease by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">31%</NUMEX> and IIb MHC-determined fiber
        type to decrease by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35%</NUMEX> in emphysema. Sugiura 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX> found that after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 weeks</TIMEX> of
        endurance swimming, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIb</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> from costal diaphragm of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">rats</ENAMEX> fell by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">54%</NUMEX>, also without statistically significant
        changes in the amounts of other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHC</ENAMEX> isoforms. This suggests
        that the effects of emphysema on the diaphragm are, as has
        been suggested by others, at least in part a function of
        increased workload.
        Other studies of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHC</ENAMEX> adaptation in animal models of
        increased diaphragmatic work have had conflicting results.
        Although various treadmill-running protocols have shown
        increases in the aerobic capacity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat diaphragm</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34 35 36 37</NUMEX> ] , running has generally not been demonstrated
        to cause consistent changes in the relative expression of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">isoforms</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29 38</NUMEX> ] . Although <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> paper has shown a
        decrease in type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IIb fibers</ENAMEX> and an increase in type I
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] , and another has shown only a significant
        decrease in type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IIb fibers</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] , a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> reported
        a surprising increase in type <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IIb fibers</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> ] .
        In contrast, inspiratory resistive loading by tracheal
        narrowing has consistently shown increases in the
        percentage of type I fibers and the corresponding MHC
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">isoform</ENAMEX> in the diaphragm [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41 42 43</NUMEX> ] , closely resembling
        the changes seen in severe human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">emphysema</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Respiratory</ENAMEX>
        loading by chronic hypercapnea has also demonstrated
        similar changes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> ] .
        Given these findings, one can postulate that shifts
        toward slower MHC isoforms in diaphragmatic muscle fibers
        result primarily from some combination of the degree and
        chronicity of the work performed by the muscle. If this is
        so, then one could arrange the experimental methods that
        have been explored that impose increased diaphragmatic
        work, from least imposed load to greatest imposed load, as
        follows: running, swimming, emphysema, hypercapnea,
        tracheal banding. It is possible that in emphysema, the
        additional impact on diaphragmatic physiology of fiber
        shortening resulting from pulmonary hyperexpansion [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5 6</NUMEX> ] affects <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHC</ENAMEX> isoform shifts beyond the influence of
        a pure increase in the workload on the muscle.
        In addition to being the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> demonstration of a
        decrease in the expression of the IIb MHC isoform in an
        animal model of emphysema, this study is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> to
        demonstrate that such a shift toward slower isoforms in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">emphysema</ENAMEX> has a significant physiologic impact on
        diaphragmatic function 
        in vitro . We show that both twitch
        speed and fatiguing properties move toward slower-twitch
        characteristics with this decrease in IIb expression. Given
        previous work in this area, it is not unexpected that even
        a shift only between the fast isoforms but away from IIb
        would result in measurable physiological changes. It has
        been noted, for example, that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIx</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> have significantly
        higher SDH activity than <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IIb fibers</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 45</NUMEX> ] and, further,
        that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIb</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">motor units</ENAMEX> are significantly more fatigue
        sensitive than IIx <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">motor units</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX> ] . Schiaffino 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX> have also demonstrated, in rat
        whole muscles, a slower maximum velocity of shortening in
        muscles made up of predominantly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IIx</ENAMEX> versus <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IIb fibers</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47</NUMEX>
        ] . Further, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sant</ENAMEX>'Ana Pereira 
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">48</TIMEX> ] have shown a major
        difference in actomyosin ATPase activity in rat single IIb
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IIx fibers</ENAMEX>, and Sieck 
        et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX> ] have shown this in
        single <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat diaphragm</ENAMEX>.
        Finally, we examined the expression of the SERCA
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in these <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, because these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are
        responsible for a significant fraction of energy
        consumption in skeletal muscle, second only to the energy
        consumed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATPase</ENAMEX> responsible for movement of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">myosin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">head</ENAMEX>. Further, diaphragmatic fatigue might be
        related to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SERCA</ENAMEX> function [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">49</TIMEX> ] and, as discussed above,
        our emphysematous <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> showed decreased diaphragm strip
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fatigability</ENAMEX>. Previous work has suggested that although
        SERCA expression in limb muscles seems to respond to
        increases in functional load by upregulating <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">SERCA 2</NUMEX> (the
        slow SERCA isoform) and downregulating <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">SERCA 1</NUMEX> (the fast
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">isoform</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> ] , similar responses might not occur in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diaphragm</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">51</TIMEX> ] . Our data showing no difference in the
        expression of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">SERCA 1 and SERCA 2 between emphysematous</NUMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> are consistent with this finding. We did
        not measure SERCA activity or phospholamban
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">phosphorylation</ENAMEX>. It is certainly possible that the overall
        activities of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or both of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SERCA</ENAMEX> isoforms are, in
        fact, different between emphysematous and control
        diaphragm, although the numbers of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fibers</ENAMEX> expressing each
        isoform are not different.
        Because mechanical indices of relaxation reflect the
        function of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SERCA</ENAMEX> in sequestering calcium in the
        sarcoplasmic reticulum [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">49</TIMEX> ] , we measured <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> relaxation
        times on our diaphragmatic strips. It is not surprising
        that, with no change in <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">SERCA 1 and SERCA 2</ENAMEX> expression
        detected by immunocytochemistry, we found no difference in
        the relaxation times between control and emphysematous
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diaphragm</ENAMEX> strips.
      
      
        Conclusion
        In sum, we have demonstrated a significant decrease in
        IIb MHC expression at both the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> and mRNA levels in
        the diaphragmatic muscle of rats with elastase-induced
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">emphysema</ENAMEX>. In concert with this shift away from the fastest
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MHC</ENAMEX> isoform, we have demonstrated 'slower' physiological
        characteristics 
        in vitro , including a longer time to
        peak tension and a greater resistance to fatigue in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">diaphragm</ENAMEX> strips. These findings suggest that earlier
        reports of physiological adaptation within the diaphragm in
        animal models of emphysema without the demonstration of
        concomitant shifts in MHC expression toward slower isoforms
        were limited by the technologies then available, which did
        not allow the evaluation of the expression of each of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">type II</ENAMEX> MHC isoforms with specific probes.
        A physiologically significant shift toward slower MHC
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">isoforms</ENAMEX> does occur in elastase-induced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">emphysema</ENAMEX> in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rodents</ENAMEX> as it does in severe human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">emphysema</ENAMEX>, but in the
        animal model the shift occurs at the faster end of the
        isoform spectrum, primarily between the type II
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">isoforms</ENAMEX>.
