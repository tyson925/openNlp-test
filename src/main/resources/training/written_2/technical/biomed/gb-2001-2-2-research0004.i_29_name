        The need for technologies that allow highly parallel
        quantitation of specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in a rapid, low-cost and
        low-sample-volume format has become increasingly apparent
        with the growing recognition of the importance of global
        approaches to molecular characterization of physiology,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2</ENAMEX>]. The ability to quantitate
        multiple proteins simultaneously has applications in basic
        biological research, molecular classification and diagnosis
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, identification of therapeutic markers and
        targets, and profiling of response to toxins and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pharmaceuticals</ENAMEX>. Many standard assays are amenable to
        parallel analysis in microtiter plates, but sample and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">reagent</ENAMEX> consumption can be prohibitive in large-scale
        studies. Two-dimensional gels are now widely used for
        large-scale protein analysis in <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> research [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>] and
        other areas of biology [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>]. Two-dimensional gels have been
        used to separate and visualize <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,000</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in a
        single experiment [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX>], and subsequent excision of protein
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bands</ENAMEX> and detection by mass spectrometry can enable
        identification of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>].
        Ordered arrays of peptides and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> provide the
        basis of another strategy for parallel protein analysis.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA microarrays</ENAMEX> have demonstrated the effectiveness of this
        approach in many areas of biological research (see [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">7, 8,</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>] for reviews). <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Protein assays</ENAMEX> using ordered <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">arrays</ENAMEX> have
        been explored since the development of multipin synthesis [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>] and spot synthesis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>] of peptides on cellulose
        supports. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Protein arrays</ENAMEX> on membranes have been used to
        screen binding specificities of a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> expression
        library [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12, 13, 14</TIMEX>] and to detect <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA-</ENAMEX>, and
        protein-binding <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>]. Arrays of clones from
        phage-display <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX> can be probed with an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">antigen</ENAMEX>-coated filter for high-throughput antibody
        screening [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX>]. Antibodies bound to glass can be used as a
        flow-cell array immunosensor [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX>], and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> spotted
        into <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">glass</ENAMEX>-bottom microwells have been used for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">miniaturized</ENAMEX>, high-throughput <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ELISA</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>]. Multiple
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antigens</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> have been patterned onto
        polystyrene using a desktop jet <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">printer</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>] and onto
        glass by covalent attachment to polyacrylamide gel pads [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX>] for parallel immunoassays. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Proteins covalently</ENAMEX> attached
        to glass slides through aldehyde-containing silane reagents
        have been used to detect <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-protein interactions</ENAMEX>,
        enzymatic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX>, and protein-small molecule interactions
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>].
        We explored the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein microarrays</ENAMEX> for the
        highly parallel quantitation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in complex
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mixtures</ENAMEX>. A robotic arrayer was used to print protein
        solutions onto the surface of a coated microscope slide in
        an ordered array. This array provides specific binding
        sites for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that we wish to measure in complex
        samples. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Protein solutions</ENAMEX> to be measured are labeled by
        covalent linkage of a fluorescent dye to the amino groups
        on the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. The labeled solutions are placed on
        arrays, and specific binding interactions (for example,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody-antigen interactions</ENAMEX>) result in localizing
        specific individual components of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">complex</ENAMEX> mixtures to
        the corresponding specific spots in the array. To maximize
        the robustness and quantitative accuracy of the array,
        comparative fluorescence measurements are made, using an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">internal</ENAMEX> standard for each <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> to be assayed. Two
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">differentially</ENAMEX> labeled <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein solutions</ENAMEX> are mixed together
        and then incubated with the array so that the fluorescence
        ratio at each spot corresponds to the concentration ratio
        of each <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein solutions</ENAMEX>. We
        characterized the performance of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> microarrays
        with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 115</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody/antigen</ENAMEX> pairs, using both
        printed arrays of antibodies to detect antigens and printed
        arrays of antigens to detect antibodies. To assess the
        applicability of this method to real-world samples, we
        examined <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> microarray detection in various
        concentration ranges and background conditions.
      
      
        Results
        
          Using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen arrays</ENAMEX> to measure
          variation in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> concentrations
          We assembled a set of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">115</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody/antigen</ENAMEX> pairs to
          evaluate the use of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein microarrays</ENAMEX> for specific
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">detection</ENAMEX> and quantitation of multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in
          complex mixtures. Microarrays were constructed by
          printing microscopic spots of either <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> (to
          detect antigens) or antigens (to detect <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX>) onto
          a modified glass surface. The microarrays contained <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>
          to twelve spots of each <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 1,100</NUMEX>
          spots all together. We performed controlled experiments
          to measure the specificity of binding, the accuracy and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">precision</ENAMEX> of quantitation, and the detection limits. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Six</NUMEX>
          different mixtures of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">115</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>
          different mixtures of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">115</NUMEX> antigens were prepared so that
          the concentration of each <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species varied</ENAMEX> in a unique
          pattern across the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> mixtures over a range of three
          orders of magnitude. Each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> mixtures was
          labeled with the dye <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Cy5</TIMEX> (red fluorescence) and then
          mixed with a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Cy3</NUMEX>-labeled (green fluorescence) 'reference'
          mixture containing each of the same <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">115</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> at a
          constant concentration. The variation across the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microarrays</ENAMEX> in the red-to-green (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">R/G</ENAMEX>) ratio measured for
          each <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> spot should reflect the
          variation in the concentration of the corresponding
          binding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX> in the set of mixes. By comparing the
          observed variation in the concentration ratios with the
          known variation in the concentration ratios, we could
          assay the performance of each antibody/<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody arrays</ENAMEX> were used to analyze a set of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>
          unique <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen mixes</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Each <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> ranged in
          concentration from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1.6 Î</NUMEX>¼g/ml to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ng</ENAMEX>/ml. The
          concentration of each <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> in the reference mixture
          was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.17 Î</NUMEX>¼g/ml. The inset in each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> highlights
          anti-Flag and anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IgG</ENAMEX> spots, and the labels indicate the
          concentration of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> applied to each array. The
          images were produced by merging an image taken with the
          Cy3-selective filter, represented as green, with an image
          taken with a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Cy5</NUMEX>-selective filter, represented as red. At
          the highest concentration (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.6</NUMEX> Î<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">¼g/ml</ENAMEX>), the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Cy5</NUMEX>-labeled
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">antigen</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX>-fold more abundant than the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Cy3</NUMEX>-labeled
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">antigen</ENAMEX>, and both the anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Flag</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4</TIMEX>) and
          anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">IgG</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3</TIMEX>) spots appeared red. At
          progressively lower concentrations, the color of the
          spots appeared more yellow, and at the lowest
          concentration of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ng</ENAMEX>/ml (Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1panel 3</ENAMEX> for anti-Flag
          and Figure <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1panel 6</ENAMEX> for anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">IgG</ENAMEX>), the spots appeared
          green. These color changes provided visual confirmation
          that the spotted <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> specifically detected
          variation in concentration of their respective
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antigens</ENAMEX>.
          In a complementary experiment, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> different
          Cy5-labeled antibody mixes were compared to a constant
          Cy3-labeled reference <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody mix</ENAMEX> using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">arrays</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). The inset in each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> highlights
          AIM1 and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kalanin</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">B1</ENAMEX> spots detecting the indicated
          concentrations of corresponding <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX>. Like the
          antibody spots, the color of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> spots varied
          appropriately with variation in the concentration of the
          corresponding binding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">partner</ENAMEX>, providing evidence that
          these spotted <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigens</ENAMEX> specifically detected their
          respective antibodies.
          To assess performance more quantitatively, the log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> of the red-to-green ratio (log 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">R/G</ENAMEX>)) for each antibody spot was
          analyzed as a function of the concentration of the
          cognate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). For each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> antibodies
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">depicted</ENAMEX>, the median log 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">R/G</ENAMEX>) of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> to twelve
          replicate spots is plotted. The error bars represent the
          standard deviation in the log 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">R/G</ENAMEX>). The dashed lines represent
          the log 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> of the true ratios of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX>
          concentrations in the two mixes. For several of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">antibodies</ENAMEX>, for example, anti-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">MEKK3</NUMEX> and anti-HCG, the
          results closely paralleled the ideal (dashed line) over
          the entire range of concentrations. Several <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX>,
          for example, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SOD</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MAP4</ENAMEX>, showed a nearly ideal response
          at high concentrations, but deviated from linearity at
          low concentrations. The plateau at low concentrations
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">corresponds</ENAMEX> to the fluorescence signal in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Cy5</TIMEX> (red)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">channel</ENAMEX> approaching the background, indicating a
          detection limit of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ng</ENAMEX>/ml for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SOD</ENAMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">MAP4</TIMEX>. For
          each <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> depicted in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">R/G</ENAMEX> ratio was
          very similar among the replicate spots, evidenced by the
          small error bars. At low concentrations of cognate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">antigen</ENAMEX>, the ratio measured for replicate spots typically
          showed increased dispersion, as with anti-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">MEKK3</NUMEX> and
          anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SIN</ENAMEX>, and in some cases the ratio could not be
          measured (that is, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Cy5</TIMEX> signal was below background).
          The complete data set, including primary images and
          quantitative data for all the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> and antigens
          tested, can be found at [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>] and as Additional data
          files available with the online version of this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">article</ENAMEX>.
          The deviations from linearity were usually consistent
          among all the replicate spots. For example, all of the
          anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCG</ENAMEX> spots showed a slight positive deviation at the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ng</ENAMEX>/ml dilution, and all of the anti-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Per2</NUMEX> spots showed
          a slight positive deviation at the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ng</ENAMEX>/ml dilution.
          For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of the antigens, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCG and Human IgG</ENAMEX>, two
          independent <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> were printed, and in both cases,
          the deviations from linearity were highly consistent
          between the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> with the same specificity. These
          close ratios suggest that the errors reflect deficiencies
          in the preparation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen solutions</ENAMEX>, such as
          pipetting errors or inconsistencies in the dye-labeling
          reaction. Additional results pointed to variation in the
          labeling reactions as the most likely source of
          variation; when we repeated an experiment using the same
          labeling reaction, the shape of the curve relating
          fluorescence ratio to concentration remained the same for
          each <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody/antigen</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX>. However, when the same
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen mixes</ENAMEX> were relabeled under slightly different
          conditions, the curve shape changed (data not shown).
          Thus variation in labeling appears to be a more important
          source of imprecision in the measurements than
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross</ENAMEX>-reactivity of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen/antibody</ENAMEX> pairs or dilution
          errors, which would be expected to be consistent among
          all experiments using the same <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen mix</ENAMEX>. As the
          protein labeling reaction is sensitive to changes in pH,
          local environment of reactive amines, and the
          concentrations of other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">reactive species</ENAMEX>, the efficiency
          of the conjugation of the dye to each <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> may be
          variable among the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in each mixture in a way that
          varies from one labeling reaction to another. Including a
          diverse set of internal control <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in the protein
          mixture to be labeled could provide a way to correct for
          this source of measurement error. Modification and
          careful control of the labeling reaction should lead to
          improvement in performance.
          Many of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> spots that showed significant
          deviations from ideal performance still provided reliable
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">qualitative</ENAMEX> or semi-quantitative measurements. For
          example, although the slope of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Mint2</NUMEX> response curve
          between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,600</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ng</ENAMEX>/ml and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ng</ENAMEX>/ml was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX>-fold greater
          than the slope of the ideal line, the fluorescence ratio
          varied monotonically with the concentration ratio over
          the entire range tested. The horizontal dashed line in
          the graph of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Mint2</NUMEX> response represents a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">R/G</ENAMEX> ratio
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> standard deviations above the value measured at the
          final dilution. Such a threshold is useful for defining a
          fluorescence ratio that would signify the presence of an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX>. All of the fluorescence ratios measured at the
          Mint2 spots exceeded this detection threshold when the
          cognate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> was present at concentrations of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ng</ENAMEX>/ml
          or higher. Thus, this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> could be used in a
          microarray format for detection and approximate
          quantitation of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Mint2</TIMEX> levels above this threshold.
          The performance of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen microarrays</ENAMEX> in detecting
          and measuring the cognate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> was analyzed in a
          similar way (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). For many of the antigens, the
          experimental data very closely follow the ideal response
          (represented by the dashed line). For antigens such as
          P38 delta, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Numb</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AIM-1</ENAMEX>, we obtained reproducible and
          accurate measurements over the entire concentration range
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). These antigens have detection limits of less
          than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ng</ENAMEX>/ml for their respective antibodies. An upward
          deviation from ideal was occasionally observed at the
          lower concentrations, as the detection limit was
          approached. The ratios measured at replicate spots were
          highly consistent and exhibited coordinated deviations
          from linearity, except in some cases at low
          concentrations where the dispersion appeared more random
          (for example, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">G3BP and ARNT1</TIMEX>).
          To summarize the overall performance of the protein
          arrays for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">115</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody/antigen pairs</ENAMEX> used in this
          study, the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> and antigens that met
          certain criteria for qualitative and quantitative
          performance are represented in Figure 5as a function of
          the concentration of the target <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> in a complex
          solution. The standard for qualitative measurement
          accuracy was defined as described above for the example
          of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Mint2</TIMEX>. An <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> was considered to
          perform satisfactorily for qualitative measurement at a
          specified concentration if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">R/G</ENAMEX> ratio measured at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX>
          of the replicate spots exceeded the threshold whenever
          the target <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> was present at or above the specified
          concentration. The fraction of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">115</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> and
          antigens that satisfied this standard for qualitative
          measurement was plotted as a function of analyte
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">concentration</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5a</NUMEX>). Over <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60%</NUMEX> of the arrayed
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">over 80%</NUMEX> of the arrayed antigens met the
          criteria at the highest analyte concentration tested (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.6</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Î¼g/ml</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">340</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ng</ENAMEX>/ml, respectively), and both percentages
          decreased with decreasing analyte concentration. The
          performance of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen microarrays</ENAMEX> was better than
          that of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> microarrays over the entire
          concentration range.
          Similarly, we plotted the percentage of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> and
          antigens that provided satisfactory quantitative accuracy
          as a function of analyte concentration (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5b</NUMEX>).
          Detection was considered quantitatively accurate if the
          above criterion for qualitative accuracy was fulfilled
          and the median <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">R/G</ENAMEX> ratio was within a factor of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of
          the known concentration ratio. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Nearly half</NUMEX> of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antigens</ENAMEX> provided quantitatively accurate measurements at
          concentrations above <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ng</ENAMEX>/ml, and the percentage
          decreased with decreasing antibody concentration. A
          smaller fraction of the tested <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> gave accurate
          quantitation of soluble <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX>. (See the web supplement
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>] and Additional data files available with this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">article</ENAMEX> for quantitative data on the entire
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody/antigen</ENAMEX> set.)
          We believe that the differences in the performance of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen arrays</ENAMEX> are likely to be
          explained by differences in dye labeling and protein
          stability. Antibodies of varying specificities all have
          very similar overall structures, and all antibodies
          irrespective of specificity can be labeled with the
          NHS-activated dyes at lysine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fc</ENAMEX> region.
          In contrast, many <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen proteins</ENAMEX> do not have easily
          accessible amines. Inefficient, highly variable, or
          non-existent labeling may explain the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30-40%</NUMEX> fewer
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen-antibody</ENAMEX> pairs that performed satisfactorily in
          qualitative detection in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> microarray format,
          as compared to the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> microarray format. Antibodies
          are also relatively stable <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, and their greater
          stability in solution, relative to their cognate
          antigens, may also contribute to the better performance
          of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen arrays</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Background effects and detection limits
          Because the background signal from non-specific
          adsorption of labeled protein increases with increasing
          protein concentration, the detection of a specific target
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> is limited not only by its concentration, but
          also by the concentration of the non-cognate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in
          the mixture. We therefore investigated the effect of
          protein background on quantitation, by adding varying
          concentrations of fetal calf serum (FCS) to the set of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen mixes</ENAMEX>, increasing the overall protein
          concentrations by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10-fold and 100</NUMEX>-fold before labeling
          and detection (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>). The images at the top of Figure
          6show details from one array in each set. The background
          fluorescence was about <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX>-fold higher at the higher
          protein concentration. The spots in the right image are
          much less clear against the high background, but the
          fluorescent signals are still measurable. Higher overall
          protein concentrations significantly reduced the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">precision</ENAMEX> of the measurements of specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>,
          presumably because of either the increased complexity of
          the mixture or the higher background. For example, the
          anti-Flag spots showed good quantitation of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Flag</ENAMEX>-tagged
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bacterial Alkaline Phosphatase</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Flag-BAP</ENAMEX>) down to an
          absolute concentration of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ng</ENAMEX>/ml and a partial
          concentration of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 -6</NUMEX>, when measured in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solution</ENAMEX> at a
          total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> concentration of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">600 Î¼g/ml.</ENAMEX> In a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6,000</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Î¼g/</ENAMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ml protein solution</ENAMEX> the data were very noisy below
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">approximately 100 ng/ml Flag-BAP</ENAMEX>. Likewise, anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SOD</ENAMEX> and
          anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCG</ENAMEX> showed increased dispersion and decreased
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">linearity</ENAMEX> when measured in a higher total protein
          concentration. Higher background at higher protein
          concentrations is probably the major cause of the
          diminished performance, since at equivalent partial
          concentrations the measurements were noisier at higher
          absolute protein concentrations. For example, at a
          partial concentration of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4 Ã— 10 -5the</NUMEX> measurements of SOD
          were very noisy in the high-serum samples, but remained
          closely correlated with the ideal response in the
          lower-serum samples. We conclude from this experiment
          that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody microarrays</ENAMEX> can allow <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">detection</ENAMEX> of a
          specific target <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> at concentrations below <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ng</ENAMEX>/ml
          and partial concentrations below <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 -6</NUMEX>. At least for the
          present, however, the total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> concentration in a
          sample to be analyzed using this system should be less
          than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/ml for optimal performance. A reduction in
          background through improved blocking of non-specific
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adsorption</ENAMEX> should further lower the detection limits.
          We also investigated the detection limits using the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen arrays</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>). The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody mixes</ENAMEX> were
          added to either a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10-fold</NUMEX> or a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>-fold excess (by total
          protein mass) of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FCS</ENAMEX>. The high-concentration set was
          diluted <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>-fold, so that the total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> concentration
          was equivalent in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sets of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> mixtures. The
          images at the top of Figure 7show a detail of a
          microarray from the analysis of each set. The background
          is very similar between the images, but the fluorescence
          intensity of the spots is greatly reduced as the partial
          and absolute concentration of the cognate antibodies
          decreases. The graphs below the left image all show good
          linearity down to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.3</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ng</ENAMEX>/ml and a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> Ã— <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> -6partial
          concentration. The graphs on the right of Figure 7show
          similar performance at similar partial concentrations,
          but more noise at the lowest concentration, where the
          specific fluorescence signals were low. The level of
          performance depicted here is <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 20</NUMEX>
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">18%</NUMEX>) of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody/antigen</ENAMEX> pairs tested. We conclude
          from this experiment that detection down to
          concentrations of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ng</ENAMEX>/ml and partial concentrations of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 -6is</NUMEX> possible using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen arrays</ENAMEX>. Reduction of total
          protein concentration below <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 100</NUMEX> Î¼g/ml did
          not improve the signal-to-noise ratio.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        We have shown that a simple microarray assay, using
        comparative fluorescence, allows simultaneous detection and
        quantitation of multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in a miniaturized,
        low-sample consumption format. Microarrays of antigens
        allowed detection and quantitation of specific antibodies
        down to partial concentrations of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">less than 10</NUMEX> -6and
        absolute concentrations of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">100 pg/ml.</ENAMEX> Microarrays of
        antibodies allowed detection and quantitation of cognate
        antigens at concentrations <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as low as 1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ng</ENAMEX>/ml and partial
        concentrations of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 -6</NUMEX>. In comparison to other
        high-throughput <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> detection methods, particularly
        two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, the detection limit of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein microarrays</ENAMEX> compares favorably. Around <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> ng of any
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> is required for detection on a two-dimensional gel
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. Several <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">microarray</ENAMEX> had detection
        limits around <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ng</ENAMEX>/ml, corresponding to an absolute
        detection limit of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 20</NUMEX> pg of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, in the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">20 Î</NUMEX>¼l
        probe volume.
        Our results suggest directions for further improvement
        of the accuracy in quantitation, such as the inclusion of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">internal</ENAMEX> calibration <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> to control for variation in
        fluorescent labeling, and the adjustment of dye labeling
        conditions to reduce the variation. The detection limits
        are likely to be improved by better passivation of the
        array surface, by using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> with higher affinities,
        and by reducing the complexity of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein solution</ENAMEX>
        through fractionation. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> we used in this
        analysis were not optimized for affinity and specificity.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Antibodies</ENAMEX> used in clinical diagnostic applications are
        commonly selected for affinities orders of magnitude higher
        than those of the research-grade <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> we used in this
        pilot study. The use of clinical-grade high-affinity
        antibodies in this format would presumably allow a
        corresponding increase in sensitivity.
        Many of the tested antibody/<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> pairs allowed
        parallel detection of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in a microarray format at
        concentrations suitable for measurement of clinically
        important <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in patient samples. For example,
        concentrations of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> Î<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">¼g/ml, 5 Î¼g/ml</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">35 Î</NUMEX>¼g/ml are
        routinely used as threshold prognostic values for the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> markers c-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">erbB</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CEA</ENAMEX>, and CA <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15.3</NUMEX>,
        respectively [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>]. The partial concentration of a protein
        at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> Î¼g/ml in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood serum</ENAMEX>, using an average total
        protein concentration of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/ml, is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> Ã— <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 -4</NUMEX>, within the
        range of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25%</NUMEX> of the antibodies tested and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70%</NUMEX> of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antigens</ENAMEX> tested. The prostate cancer marker prostate
        specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSA</ENAMEX>) is clinically useful in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10-20</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ng/ml</ENAMEX> range [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX>], or a partial concentration of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3 Ã— 10 -7</ENAMEX>.
        The best <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody/antigen</ENAMEX> pairs tested had detection limits
        in this range. The prospects for clinical application of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen microarrays</ENAMEX> in monitoring antibody response to
        immunization, infection, or other disorders, are extremely
        promising. A natural immune response typically yields
        specific IgG concentrations ranging from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 10</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ng/ml</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>] to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">over 3 Î</NUMEX>¼g/ml, [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>] well within the
        detection limits most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antigens</ENAMEX> tested.
        In conclusion, these experiments demonstrate that a
        comparative fluorescence assay using microarrays of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> and antigens can provide a practical approach to
        specific, quantitative, and highly parallel detection of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> at physiologically relevant concentrations.

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TX</ENAMEX>). Briefly, glass microscope slides were cleaned in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX>

          a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M</ENAMEX> pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.0</NUMEX> sodium <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbonate</ENAMEX> buffer. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> and
          dye <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">solutions</ENAMEX> were mixed together so that the final
          protein concentration was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.2</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/ml and the final dye
          concentration was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100-300 Î¼M</NUMEX>. Normally <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">approximately 15</TIMEX>
          Î¼g <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> was labeled per array. The reactions were
          allowed to sit in the dark for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">45 min</TIMEX> and then quenched
          by the addition of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a tenth</NUMEX> volume <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M pH 8 Tris</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base</ENAMEX> (a
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX>-fold molar excess of quencher). The reaction
          solutions were brought to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> ml with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> and then loaded
          into microconcentrator spin columns (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amicon Microcon</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>)
          with a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Da</ENAMEX> molecular weight cutoff. After
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">centrifugation</ENAMEX> to reduce the volume to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 10</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Î¼l</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">approximately 20 min</TIMEX>), a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3%</NUMEX> non-fat <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk</ENAMEX> blocking
          solution was added to each Cy5-labeled solution such that
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">25 Î</NUMEX>¼l <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk</ENAMEX> was added for each array to be generated from
          the mix. (The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">milk</ENAMEX> had been first spun down as above.)
          The volume was again brought to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> ml with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> and the
          sample again centrifuged to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~10</NUMEX> Î¼l. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Cy3</NUMEX>-labeled
          reference mix was divided equally among the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Cy5</NUMEX>-labeled
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mixes</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> was added to each to achieve <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">25 Î</NUMEX>¼l for
          each array. Finally, the mixes were filtered with a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.45</NUMEX>
          Î¼m spin filter (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Millipore</ENAMEX>) by centrifugation at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,000</NUMEX> Ã—
          g for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> min.
        
        
          Detection
          Each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">microarray</ENAMEX> was removed individually from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">wash</ENAMEX> (see above), and excess liquid was shaken off.
          Without allowing the array to dry, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">25 Î¼l</NUMEX> dye-labeled
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein solution</ENAMEX> was applied to the surface within the
          marked boundaries. A <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">24 Ã— 30 mm</NUMEX> cover slip was placed
          over the solution. The arrays were sealed in a chamber
          with an under-layer of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> to provide humidification,
          after which they sat at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4Â°C</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 h.</TIMEX> The arrays were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dunked</ENAMEX> briefly in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> to remove the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein solution</ENAMEX> and
          the cover slip, and they were then allowed to rock gently
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX><NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">/0</NUMEX><NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">.1%</NUMEX> Tween-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> solution for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> min. The arrays were
          then washed twice in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5-10 min each</TIMEX> and twice in H
          
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5-10 min each</TIMEX>. All washes were
          at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">room</ENAMEX> temperature. After spinning to dryness in a
          clinical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centrifuge</ENAMEX> equipped with plate carriers
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beckman</ENAMEX>), the arrays were scanned in an Axon
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Laboratories</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Palo Alto</ENAMEX>, CA) scanner using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">532</NUMEX> nm and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">635</NUMEX>
          nm <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">lasers</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Analysis
          The relative concentration of each <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> in two
          separate dye-labeled <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">pools</ENAMEX> was determined by comparing
          the fluorescence intensities in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the Cy3- and Cy5</TIMEX>-specific
          channels at each spot. The location of each analyte spot
          on the array was outlined using the gridding software
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenePix</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Axon Laboratories</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Palo Alto</ENAMEX>, CA) and ScanAlyze
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>]. The background, calculated as the median of pixel
          intensities from the local area around each spot, was
          subtracted from the average pixel intensity within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">each</TIMEX>
          spot. The background-subtracted values in the red channel
          were multiplied by a normalization factor to correct for
          detection differences in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> channels. The
          normalization factor was found by comparing the red/green
          ratios of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> well-behaved <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> or
          antigens, which served as internal standards, to the
          ratio of the known concentrations. A factor was
          calculated which, when multiplied with the signal in the
          red <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">channel</ENAMEX>, minimized the difference between the ideal
          and observed red/green ratios. A separate normalization
          factor was calculated for each array. To normalize the
          ratios for the antigens or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> that were used in
          calculating the factor, a separate factor was used in
          which that particular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> was dropped
          from the calculation (that is, a spot was never used to
          normalize itself). Finally, the ratios of the
          background-subtracted, normalized signal intensities were
          calculated to estimate the relative concentrations
          between <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in the separately labeled pools.
