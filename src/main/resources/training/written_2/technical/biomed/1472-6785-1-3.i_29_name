        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Microcosm</ENAMEX> and mesocosm studies are commonly used in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ecological</ENAMEX> studies of aquatic and terrestrial habitats [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microcosms</ENAMEX> and mesocosms are generally subsets of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> and abiotic factors of particular ecosystems,
        with restricted exchange of matter and energy [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . These
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">containers</ENAMEX> are by definition smaller than the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX>'s
        actual habitat, and controversy exists about the relevance
        of these studies because of the scaling of simulated
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">habitats</ENAMEX> and the lack of replication and complexity [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 3 4</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> ] . There is often an implicit, and untested, assumption
        that scaling doesn't affect experimental outcomes in
        microcosm studies [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] .
        Aquatic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes</ENAMEX> are often studied in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">micro</ENAMEX>- and mesocosms; in fact, much of what we know about
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mosquitoes</ENAMEX> has come from microcosm and laboratory studies
        [e.g., <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6-14</ENAMEX>]. These types of studies may be more relevant
        for those <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">breed</ENAMEX> in phytotelmata (i.e.,
        plant-held <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">waters</ENAMEX>) or artificial containers, as these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">experimental</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">units</ENAMEX> may hold as much volume as many natural
        treeholes, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pitcher plants</ENAMEX>, or other containers [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16</NUMEX> ] .
        However, there may still be fundamental ecological effects
        of changing habitat size for <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">aquatic insects</ENAMEX> living in a
        variety of habitats, such as phytotelmata and ponds.
        One species of mosquito that breeds in natural and
        artificial habitats of various sizes is 
        Culex pipiens <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L.</ENAMEX>, more commonly known
        as the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">house</ENAMEX> mosquito [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18</NUMEX> ] . This culicid has a more
        or less global distribution, and is found in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North America</ENAMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Africa</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Asia</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australia</ENAMEX>. Although 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> pipiens primarily utilizes birds
        as bloodmeal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hosts</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19 20</NUMEX> ] , it inhabits human-made
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">containers</ENAMEX>, and is a known pest of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] .
        
        Culex pipiens <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females oviposit</ENAMEX>, and
        larvae survive, in a wide array of aquatic habitats,
        including gutters, birdbaths, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pools</ENAMEX>, rain barrels,
        treeholes, and stagnant pools of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 21</NUMEX> ] . In many
        of these aquatic habitats, leaf litter forms the basis of
        the food web. Microbes grow on the leaf litter and other
        detritus, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes</ENAMEX> such as 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> pipiens browse substrate or filter
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">microbes</ENAMEX> and detritus [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . Because the size
        of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> pipiens habitat varies, and
        because there is often an implicit assumption in
        experimental designs that microcosm scale does not affect
        experimental outcomes [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] , it is a logical species to
        test for scale effects.
        Varying habitat size affects <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> and communities
        living in small aquatic habitats, and many of these species
        appear to be flexible in their choice of habitat [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 23 24</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> ] . However, we need to be able to distinguish between
        fundamental effects of scale, that is, how habitats of
        different size affect growth and survival of individual 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> pipiens, and artifacts caused by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">scaling</ENAMEX>, which may be determined as much by experimental
        design as by actual differences in habitat scale [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vertical</ENAMEX>, or wall, surface area is thought to be the source
        of artifacts in micro- and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mesocosm</ENAMEX> experiments that are
        scaled down from actual habitat size and artificially
        enclose the system in question [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . Wall area is an
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">artifact</ENAMEX>, because as microcosms are scaled down wall area
        per <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> volume increases, which may affect composition of
        the microbial <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> and increase dominance of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">periphyton</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . Determining the source of effects is
        critical for understanding the ecology of scaling and for
        how microcosm design affects experimental outcomes. If
        scaling of habitat affects 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> pipiens, which inhabits aquatic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX> of varying size, it might likely affect many other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> that either live in small aquatic habitats, or
        have been tested in small-scale microcosms.
        Resource quantity, in the form of leaf litter, also
        varies in these habitats, and we sought to test for an
        interaction between the effects of food abundance on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mosquitoes</ENAMEX>, which are well known [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] , and the effects
        of habitat size. This would give us a better understanding
        of how scaling impacts the biology of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes</ENAMEX>,
        especially as higher quantities of leaf litter increase
        growth of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>, some of which might grow over the
        vertical surfaces of microcosms, and consequently provide
        more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> to mosquito larvae. We hypothesized that there
        would be detrimental effects of increasing depth and
        decreasing horizontal surface area on survival and growth
        of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> pipiens. Specifically, microcosms
        with a lower horizontal surface area to depth ratio will
        have an adverse effect on developing <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes</ENAMEX> because of
        lowered exchange of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gases</ENAMEX>, which may increase growth of
        anaerobic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> that produce <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">methane</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hydrogen</ENAMEX> sulfide
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CJP</ENAMEX>, unpublished data), or allow accumulation of mosquito
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wastes</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Hydrogen sulfide</ENAMEX>, for instance, is a known <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">toxin</ENAMEX> to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] , and affects growth of the eastern treehole
        mosquito 
        Aedes triseriatus (<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paradise</ENAMEX>,
        unpublished data). Microcosms with less vertical (wall)
        surface area per unit volume than others will be
        detrimental to <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes</ENAMEX>, as there will be less surface
        area from which to browse for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">microbes</ENAMEX>. Finally, we
        hypothesized that effects of leaf litter quantity could
        interact with effects of container size, as increased leaf
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">litter</ENAMEX> may compensate for lower wall area per unit volume,
        since microbes grow, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes browse</ENAMEX>, on leaf litter
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . High food abundance appears to decrease <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX> and
        compensate for detrimental abiotic factors [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 27 29</NUMEX> ] .
        Our experimental design allowed us to test for both
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">vertical</ENAMEX> and horizontal surface area effects, which may be
        both natural effects of changing habitat size or artifacts
        of experimental microcosm design [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] .
      
      
        Results
        The interaction between food availability and container
        size was significant for all response variables except
        female biomass, which was affected only by main effects
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1a). Not surprisingly, high leaf litter
        quantity led to larger mass, shorter larval development
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> and higher survival (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Figs.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1and 2a</ENAMEX>). When the
        interaction was present, there was no effect of scale at
        high food abundance, but when food abundance was low,
        container size affected <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">male</ENAMEX> and female development time
        and mass of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Figs.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1b</ENAMEX>,c,<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">d</ENAMEX>). There were significant
        differences between B (Base size - used in other
        experiments [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] ; see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials & Methods and Table</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) and CD (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Constant Depth</ENAMEX>) microcosms for female biomass
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">male</ENAMEX> and female time to maturity, such that B
        microcosms, with more wall area per unit volume, had
        larger, earlier emerging <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Figs.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1a</ENAMEX>, c, and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1d</TIMEX>;
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Table 1</ENAMEX>). This is evidence for experimental artifacts
        caused by decreasing wall surface area per unit volume.
        However, differences between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CW</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Constant Width</ENAMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CS</ENAMEX>
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Constant Shape - Table 2</ENAMEX>) were not evident.
        Fundamental scale effects caused by increased volume
        were also present, but only for the main effect of scale on
        female biomass (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1a). B microcosms compared to CW
        microcosms were never significantly different, and CD vs.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CS</ENAMEX> comparisons were only different for female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biomass</ENAMEX>,
        where <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CS</ENAMEX>, the largest and deepest
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">containers</ENAMEX>, were significantly larger. In addition,
        mosquitoes reached maturity quicker and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> were larger
        in B/low litter microcosms than in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CS/</ENAMEX>low litter microcosms
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Figs.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1b</ENAMEX>,c,<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">d</ENAMEX>). These latter comparisons include both
        fundamental effects and wall area effects, but also
        indicate adverse effects on <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes</ENAMEX> as container size
        increases.
        The logistic regression analysis revealed that survival
        was dependent on litter quantity, horizontal surface area,
        and depth (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). More <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes</ENAMEX> survived in
        high leaf litter treatments than in low leaf litter
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">treatments</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2a). Emergence was markedly lower than
        survival in most low litter treatments, while almost all
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes</ENAMEX> that survived also emerged from high litter
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">treatments</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2a). This is partly an artifact caused by
        experimental duration. Microcosms with low horizontal
        surface area (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CW</ENAMEX>) had lower survival than those with
        high horizontal surface area (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2c), and deeper
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microcosms</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CW</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CS</ENAMEX>) had lower survival than shallower
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microcosms</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2b). CD <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">microcosms</ENAMEX> had higher survival
        than B and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CS</ENAMEX>, and yet the latter produced larger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX>
        than CD (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Figs.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1aand 2a</ENAMEX>).
      
      
        Discussion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Petersen et al.</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] make a number of recommendations
        about using artificial habitats to test ecological
        questions, among them the suggestion to perform
        scale-sensitive experiments that allow an independent
        understanding of volume and wall effects. In this
        experiment, we independently varied different dimensions of
        small aquatic habitats to look at how microcosm design
        choices may affect experimental outcomes, and how natural
        changes in habitat size and shape may affect aquatic insect
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">larvae</ENAMEX> in a potentially resource-limited environment.
        Our <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> habitat size hypotheses predicted: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) an adverse
        effect of a lower wall area per unit volume, a possible
        artifact of microcosm design (compare B to CD and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CW</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CS</ENAMEX>
        - see <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Materials & Methods and Table 2</ENAMEX>), and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) an
        adverse effect of a lower horizontal surface area to depth
        ratio (compare B to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CW</ENAMEX> and CD to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CS</ENAMEX>), which may be a factor
        in experimental design or in choice of oviposition site by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX>. We found more support for the former hypothesis
        than the latter, but regardless, we found that container
        size interacted with resources such that 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> pipiens is affected by habitat
        size only when resources are scarce. <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Mosquitoes</ENAMEX> in the CW
        microcosms, with the smallest surface area and the greatest
        depth, had the lowest survival. Both small horizontal
        surface area and large depth decrease matter exchange
        between the container and the surrounding environment, and
        increase waste accumulation from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">microbes</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> ] . Small horizontal surface area and small volume may
        also increase direct interactions among individual
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mosquitoes</ENAMEX>, thus increasing interference competition.
        However, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CW</ENAMEX> microcosms were not
        significantly different from other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes</ENAMEX> in size or
        time to maturity. Differences did appear in comparisons of
        B to CD <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">microcosms</ENAMEX>, indicating possible wall effects. Our
        prediction was that B microcosms, with more wall area per
        unit volume would allow for greater growth and shorter
        development time of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes</ENAMEX>, which it did at low
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resource</ENAMEX> levels, possibly by providing more substrate on
        which periphyton could grow [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . In addition, at low
        litter abundance there is less leaf surface area, and the
        effects of varying wall surface area will be greater under
        conditions of limiting resources. Shorter development time
        is important in ephemeral aquatic habitats such as
        temporary ponds and phytotelmata, allowing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> to escape
        prior to dry down in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late spring</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early summer</TIMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29 30</NUMEX> ]
        . Short time to maturity allows the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">insects</ENAMEX> to escape their
        larval habitat before it dries up, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> that mature
        before <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> are ready to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mate</ENAMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> emerge.
        To test horizontal surface area effects, we can compare
        CD to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CS</ENAMEX> and B to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CW</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Females</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CS</ENAMEX> microcosms
        were larger than <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> from CD <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">microcosms</ENAMEX>, regardless of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resource</ENAMEX> levels. Both have the same wall area per unit
        volume, but CD <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">microcosms</ENAMEX> had more horizontal surface area
        per <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> volume than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CS</ENAMEX> microcosms, and we predicted that
        CD <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">microcosms</ENAMEX> would yield larger and faster growing larvae.
        The extremely large volume in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CS containers</ENAMEX> may have
        supported high densities of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">microbes</ENAMEX> in the water column
        and prevented leaf litter from packing together, thus
        allowing more surface area for microbial growth and less
        interference among <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes browsing</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> than in
        smaller volume containers where leaves were more tightly
        packed. We observed more tightly packed leaf litter in
        smaller containers with high leaf litter quantities, but we
        did not measure microbial growth, so this idea remains to
        be tested. Although wall area per unit volume was
        equivalent in those <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> treatments, the high volume of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CS</ENAMEX>
        indirectly produced more "wall" surface area. The other
        comparison between B and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CW</ENAMEX> microcosms yielded mosquitoes
        that were similar in size and development rate. However,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes</ENAMEX> in B microcosms had higher survival than in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CW</ENAMEX>,
        which had a lower horizontal surface area to depth ratio
        than B, in accordance with our <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> hypothesis.
        A final comparison of B to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CS</ENAMEX> microcosms (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>) is of
        interest because it represents a comparison of constant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">scaling</ENAMEX>, which encapsulates both horizontal and vertical
        scaling effects [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . Here the major effect is in time to
        maturity and male biomass, with the smaller volume
        container producing larger <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> with shorter development
        times (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). The large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">microcosms</ENAMEX> had both less
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">horizontal</ENAMEX> and vertical surface area per unit volume, but a
        larger horizontal surface area to depth ratio. Even though
        B microcosms had a lower horizontal surface area to depth
        ratio, the actual depth was <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only 6 cm</NUMEX>, and positive effects
        of more wall area and more horizontal surface area per unit
        volume may have outweighed adverse effects of depth.
        The interaction we found between habitat size and food
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">abundance</ENAMEX> is consequential for ecology of the organisms
        within, and there may be a complex relationship between
        habitat size, habitat drying (which changes volume when it
        occurs), and resources [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30 32</NUMEX> ] . For instance, leaf
        litter resources are often limiting to <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> in aquatic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">detritus</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 15 22 32 33</NUMEX> ] . Resources
        in the form of leaf litter are consumed by microbes, which
        are then consumed by mosquito larvae, along with small
        particulate organic matter [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . When litter abundance
        is high, microbial growth is also high (CJ <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paradise</ENAMEX>,
        personal observation), due to both high levels of resources
        and substrate for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">microbes</ENAMEX> to grow on. This may lead to
        increased detritivore growth and decreased <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stress</ENAMEX> due to
        deficiencies in abiotic factors, as evidenced by the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes</ENAMEX> in high leaf litter treatments being unaffected
        by habitat size and shape. Higher growth by larvae leads to
        larger size, and larger female <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes</ENAMEX> have higher
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fecundity</ENAMEX> and both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">males</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> have higher adult
        survival [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7 34 35</ENAMEX> ] .
        Growth and survival may thus be affected by habitat
        size, which varies greatly among small aquatic habitats [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 24 31 36</NUMEX> ] . There is a positive relationship between
        size, or volume, of the habitat and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species richness</ENAMEX>, and
        between volume and growth responses of individual species [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 23 24 25 31 37</NUMEX> ] . Levels of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> and resources may be
        important cues to ovipositing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX>, with resulting
        impacts on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 16 38 39</ENAMEX> ] .
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oviposition</ENAMEX> site selection is an important variable
        affecting survival and development of non-dispersing
        larvae, and large volumes may be preferred by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX>
        laying <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eggs</ENAMEX> in aquatic environments due to increased
        stability and decreased risk of drought [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29 39</NUMEX> ] .
        However, allochthonous plant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">material</ENAMEX> from surrounding
        terrestrial areas is the major input of energy resources to
        many freshwater detritus-based food webs, and resource
        quantity in these habitats is highly heterogeneous and
        dependent on location of the habitat relative to resource
        inputs [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 40</NUMEX> ] . Clearly, the choice of habitat by
        ovipositing 
        C pipiens <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> will have growth
        and survival consequences for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">offspring</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Conclusions
        Choice of scale in experimental design is important,
        even when studying <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mosquitoes</ENAMEX> adapted to a wide variety of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">habitats</ENAMEX>. The scale effect is likely to be caused by a
        combination of horizontal surface area, wall area, and
        depth. When food resources are low, high horizontal and
        vertical surface area per unit volume allow for greater
        growth than in conditions of low horizontal and vertical
        surface area per unit volume. Larval densities used in this
        experiment were fairly low, but competition for resources
        may still have occurred when leaf litter quantities were
        low. The effects of container dimensions thus constrain
        larval growth, possibly by decreasing exchange of materials
        or reducing inputs of resources, an area of future
        investigation. Choice of container size, either by
        ovipositing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">females</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX>, interacts with a major
        aspect of the ecology of these <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>; obtaining
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX> in a potentially resource-limited
        environment.
      
      
        Materials and Methods
        The experimental design consisted of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twenty-four</TIMEX>
        microcosms, each of which fell into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> different scale
        types: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) a "base" size (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B</ENAMEX>), which has been used in
        microcosm studies of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">treehole mosquitoes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] , [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] ,
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) "constant width" (CW), using the same size
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">container</ENAMEX> and doubling the depth, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) "constant depth" (CD),
        using the same depth as the base, but doubling the width,
        and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) "constant shape" (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CS</ENAMEX>), which doubles both the width
        and depth of the base treatment (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>).
        By comparing B to CD and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CW</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CS</ENAMEX> we can assess whether
        there were experimental artifacts caused by decreasing wall
        surface area per unit volume. Both pairs have containers
        with the same depth, but the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> container in each pair
        has more total wall surface area and less wall area per
        unit volume. By comparing B to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CW</ENAMEX> and CD to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CS</ENAMEX> we could
        test for fundamental scale effects caused by increased
        volume. Both pairs here have containers with the same width
        and have the same wall area per unit volume. However, the
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> container in each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> is deeper and has less
        horizontal surface area per unit volume.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microcosms</ENAMEX> used for B and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">CW</ENAMEX> treatments were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.0</NUMEX> liter
        polyethylene containers. Dimensions were <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">8 cm × 8 cm</NUMEX> at the
        microcosm bottom, widening to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">9.5 cm × 9.5</NUMEX> cm at the top,
        with a total depth of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13.8</NUMEX> cm. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Microcosms</ENAMEX> used for CD and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CS</ENAMEX> treatments were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.0</NUMEX> liter <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">polyethylene</ENAMEX> containers, with
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">full</TIMEX> width of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> cm and a total depth of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20.5</NUMEX> cm. These
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">containers</ENAMEX> were not completely square, as the vertical
        comers were rounded. Actual dimensions are shown in Table
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>. The overall habitat sizes are within the range of
        natural habitats used by 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> pipiens. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Netting</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.2</NUMEX> mm mesh)
        covered holes cut in the lids.
        Within each scale type, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">microcosms</ENAMEX> had high
        leaf litter (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 10 g ·</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">l -1of</ENAMEX> dried red oak ( 
        Quercus rubra <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">L.)</ENAMEX> leaves) and half
        had low leaf litter (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g ·</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">I -1of</ENAMEX> dried red
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">oak leaves</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>), with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> replicates of each
        treatment combination. These resource levels have been
        shown to affect growth of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">treehole mosquitoes</ENAMEX> and
        colonization of artificial treeholes in the field [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 28</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31 33</NUMEX> ] . Leaves were collected in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 2000</TIMEX>, dried for
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one week</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">80°C</TIMEX>, weighed to within <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.05 g</NUMEX> of the desired
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">mass</ENAMEX>, and added to the appropriate microcosms. The drying
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">leaves</ENAMEX> may mimic natural conditions, as <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> in
        container habitats is ephemeral, with containers drying and
        filling with precipitation inputs [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 29 30</NUMEX> ] .
        After addition of leaf litter, distilled <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> was added
        to a line that marked the appropriate depth. We allowed the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microcosms</ENAMEX> to incubate for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one week</TIMEX> while leaves were
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">wetted</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">microbes</ENAMEX> grew. We then added <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> instar 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX> pipiens larvae obtained from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carolina Biological Supply</ENAMEX> to each microcosm in such a way
        that the density of each microcosm would be relatively
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">constant</ENAMEX>. However, because of the slight differences in
        shape noted above, the exact initial densities ranged from
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 to 26</NUMEX> larvae · <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">I -1</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>).
        The mosquito larvae were added on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17 February 2000</TIMEX>, and
        by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early March</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> had begun to emerge from high leaf
        litter treatments. As the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> emerged <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each day</TIMEX>, they
        were captured, counted, and sexed. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Adults</ENAMEX> were frozen and
        later dried at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">100°C</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3-5 days</TIMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">determination</ENAMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biomass</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> were collected <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">March</ENAMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2000</TIMEX>, at which point emergence was less than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>
        per day for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one week</TIMEX>, and we ended the experiment. At that
        point, the microcosms were searched for remaining larvae
        and pupae, which were counted for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">determination</ENAMEX> of total
        survival to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that day</TIMEX>.
        Percentage survival, length of larval period, and total
        female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biomass</ENAMEX> were calculated. Statistical analysis
        consisted of two-way analyses of variance (ANOVA) on the
        mean male and female <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">biomass</ENAMEX> and time to maturity from each
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">microcosm</ENAMEX>, and logistic regression on proportion survival.
        For the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANOVAs</ENAMEX>, we used the means because individual
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mosquito</ENAMEX> responses were not independent, and an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANOVA</ENAMEX> model
        with microcosm nested within the fixed effects of leaf
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">litter</ENAMEX> and container size did not work because some
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">microcosms</ENAMEX> had no mosquito emergence. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tukey</ENAMEX> procedure
        for comparisons of treatment means was used when tests were
        significant for interactions at or below the α of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.0125</NUMEX>
        (=<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.05/#</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ANOVAs</ENAMEX> performed = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05/4</NUMEX>; [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ] ). Time to
        maturity was log-transformed to approximate <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">normality</ENAMEX> and
        reduce heteroscedasticity. For logistic regression, we
        tested for relationships between survival and horizontal
        surface area, volume, vertical surface area, depth, and
        leaf litter quantity. We did not test proportion emergence
        because more <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> might have emerged from low leaf litter
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">treatments</ENAMEX> had the experiment been run longer, possibly
        biasing those results.
