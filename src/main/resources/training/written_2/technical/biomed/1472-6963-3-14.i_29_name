        Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the past decade</TIMEX>, the term "evidence-based <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX>"
        (or EBM) has gained considerable currency. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EBM</ENAMEX> has been
        described as a "paradigm shift" [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] that will "change
        medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">practice</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</TIMEX> ahead." [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] Some suggest
        that the principles of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EBM</ENAMEX> should be part of the standard
        training of all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> and that those <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> who
        violate its precepts should ultimately face license
        suspension. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Critics</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EBM</ENAMEX> claim that "there is no
        evidence (and unlikely ever to be) that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EBM</ENAMEX> provides better
        medical care," and that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EBM</ENAMEX> is simply "following its own
        political agenda." [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] Other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> use even harsher
        rhetoric, claiming that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EBM</ENAMEX>'s assumptions are "absurd" and
        "irrational". [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">commentators</ENAMEX> claim a middle ground
        by saying that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EBM</ENAMEX> and other approaches should be
        "harmonized". [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ]
        The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> argue that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EBM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">proponents</ENAMEX> overemphasize the
        value of clinical trials. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> suggest that there
        are other aspects to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX>. Some note the fundamental
        role of basic science in understanding the physiologic
        mechanisms of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>, the biology of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, and the
        cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 7</NUMEX> ] There are also critics
        who emphasize the value of clinical experience and the
        judgment of individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX>; [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8 9 10</NUMEX> ] these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> sometimes emphasize the 
        art of medicine, [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] and contrast
        this with the 
        science of medicine, or they speak of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">techne</ENAMEX> vs. theory or compassion vs. reason. And other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX> might argue that there are circumstances in which
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">observational</ENAMEX> studies (or outcome studies)are a better
        choice than clinical trials [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] .
        The questions raised by this debate are fundamental: How
        should <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> practice <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX>? Should they do so in
        accordance with the principles of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EBM</ENAMEX>? If so, how should
        this be accomplished? How should health care dollars best
        be spent? While there has been considerable debate about
        these questions, it seems to us that the debate also
        involves some confusion. The confusion is a good indication
        that some conceptual clarification is in order, and that is
        our principal aim in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>. Our philosophical analysis
        will be limited to conceptual and epistemological issues;
        there are ethical issues that arise in the practice of
        evidence-based <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX>, but we will not be addressing
        those questions.
        Philosophers distinguish different types of questions.
        The questions just raised are, in this context, the 
        basic questions, or the 
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> order questions. By contrast, 
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> order questions are questions
        about the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> order questions, e.g., questions about the
        concepts employed in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> order questions. We can also
        refer to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> order questions as 
        conceptual questions. In the present
        context, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> order questions would include: what is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EBM</ENAMEX>? What are the alternatives to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EBM</ENAMEX>? What is the
        relationship between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EBM</ENAMEX> and the alternative approaches to
        medicine? Does EBM represent a paradigm shift? Without
        clear and compelling answers to these <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> order
        questions, the debate about the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> order questions will
        be an exercise in futility. Obviously, if both sides in the
        debate have different ideas about what <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EBM</ENAMEX> is, then the
        opposing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">sides</ENAMEX> will be talking past each other when they
        argue about whether or not EBM should be practiced. We have
        to agree on what we are talking about before we can make
        progress on the question of whether it is a good thing.
        This seems obvious, but in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> section of our
        discussion we will argue that some overly broad
        characterizations of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EBM</ENAMEX> have in fact done much to obscure
        the debate. In section <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>, we will argue that it is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">unhelpful</ENAMEX> and misleading to portray <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EBM</ENAMEX> as a paradigm shift
        and that such portrayals have polarized the debate in an
        unfortunate way.
        We will claim that it is much more useful to see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EBM</ENAMEX> and
        its alternatives in light of a different philosophical
        picture: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">W.V. Quine</ENAMEX>'s web of belief metaphor. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] Seen
        in this light, we can see that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EBM</ENAMEX> is an approach to
        medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">practice</ENAMEX> that is indeed importantly different from
        the alternatives. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quinean</ENAMEX> metaphor helps us to
        understand these differences, and this in turn puts us in a
        position to evaluate much more effectively the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> order
        normative questions about how <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX> ought to be
        practiced. We will begin in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> section by explaining
        certain aspects of his view that are most relevant to the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EBM</ENAMEX> debate before applying the view in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> and final
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">section</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Discussion
        
          What is EBM?
          As has been noticed by others [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7 13</ENAMEX> ] , the debate
          about the value of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EBM</ENAMEX> has been muddied by an unfortunate
          tendency to define the term "evidence-based <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX>" in
          an overly broad manner. For example, here is one
          definition of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EBM</ENAMEX> that has some claim to being
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">authoritative</ENAMEX>: "The conscientious, explicit and judicious
          use of current best evidence in making decisions about
          the care of individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>" [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . In a similar
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">vein</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brian Haynes</ENAMEX> writes "<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Advocates</ENAMEX> of evidence-based
          medicine want clinicians and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">consumers</ENAMEX> to pay attention
          to the best findings from health care research that are
          both valid and ready for clinical application". [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ]
          Taken at face value, these definitions seem merely to say
          that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EBM</ENAMEX> is the wise use of the best evidence available.
          Given that characterization alone, it would be
          astonishing that there is any dispute about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EBM</ENAMEX>. It would
          be equally astonishing that anyone could think <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EBM</ENAMEX>,
          defined in this manner, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">revolutionary</ENAMEX> or even useful.
          After all, who could possibly be opposed to using the
          best evidence wisely?
          The very term "evidence-based <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX>" seems
          similarly vacuous - as if any alternative to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EBM</ENAMEX> means
          doing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX> based on something other than evidence.
          Even homeopaths base their treatments on evidence of a
          sort, and we suspect that homeopaths would even claim
          that they are conscientiously and explicitly using the
          best evidence available. Of course they are wrong about
          the latter claim, but nothing in these standard
          definitions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EBM</ENAMEX> tells us why <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">homeopathy</ENAMEX> fails to be
          evidence-based <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX>. Furthermore, few would suggest
          that the very idea of using evidence in medicine
          constitutes a revolutionary paradigm shift. Perhaps
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocates</ENAMEX> of the term "evidence-based <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX>" have a
          philosophical theory of evidence, a theory according to
          which everything that has passed for evidence prior to
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EBM</ENAMEX> movement was not evidence at all. However, if
          they have such a theory, we have not seen it
          expressed.
          In the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Background</ENAMEX> section, we mentioned a number of
          criticisms that have been raised against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EBM</ENAMEX>. With such
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">critics</ENAMEX>, we have the beginnings of an intelligible
          debate, for we have several reasonably distinct
          approaches to intervention questions, and we can ask
          substantive questions about the strengths and weaknesses
          of each, and we can ask which should be used when or how
          they should be combined. The present point is simply
          this: there is a tendency for some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">proponents</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EBM</ENAMEX> to
          duck these questions and avoid this debate by 
          defining "evidence-based <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX>"
          such that it includes the best possible combination of
          basic science, clinical experience, and clinical trials.
          In so doing, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">proponents</ENAMEX> of EBM come awfully close to
          simply 
          defining <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EBM</ENAMEX> as the best way to
          practice medicine, whatever that may be. In other words,
          they respond to the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> order conceptual question
          ("what is EBM?") by saying that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EBM</ENAMEX> is whatever approach
          to medicine best answers the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> order normative
          question ("how ought we to practice <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX>?"). The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">proponents</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EBM</ENAMEX> thereby give the illusion of having
          answered both sets of questions when in fact they have
          answered neither. They thus walk away from an important
          and substantive debate.
          We emphasize that our concern about the definition of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EBM</ENAMEX> stems not merely from an academic desire for
          philosophical clarity. Our concern is eminently
          practical: we believe that the debate between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EBM</ENAMEX> and
          alternative approaches is important and can change
          medical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">practice</ENAMEX>. But if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EBM</ENAMEX> is explicitly defined in a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">way</ENAMEX> that is essentially vacuous, the debate will be
          unproductive. If this debate is to yield <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fruit</ENAMEX>, we must
          therefore clarify what we mean when we speak of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EBM</ENAMEX>.
          The heart of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EBM</ENAMEX> is the use of randomized controlled
          trials (RCTs) to determine the safety and efficacy of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interventions</ENAMEX>, e.g. treatment, diagnosis, and prevention.
          Of course, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EBM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">advocates</ENAMEX> have taken care to allow a role
          for other factors beyond evidence from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCTs</ENAMEX>. In
          particular, one must take into account the clinical state
          and circumstances of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>, as well as the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s own preferences and actions. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 16 17 18</NUMEX> ]
          Even for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EBM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">practitioners</ENAMEX>, the research evidence is but
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> component of medical decision making. But of course
          alternative approaches to medical practice will also take
          into account the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s clinical state and values;
          this is not what separates EBM from the other approaches.
          What separates EBM from other approaches is the priority
          it gives to certain forms of evidence, and according to
          EBM the most highly prized form of evidence comes from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCTs</ENAMEX> (including systematic reviews) and meta-analyses of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCTs</ENAMEX>. So, for the purposes of this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>, we will take
          the term "evidence-based <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX>" to refer essentially
          to the practice of taking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCTs</ENAMEX> as the strongly preferred
          form of medical evidence.
        
        
          Is EBM a paradigm shift?
          
            Why it matters
            It seems to us that when <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">proponents</ENAMEX> grandly describe
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EBM</ENAMEX> as a paradigm shift, they not only make a
            philosophical mistake, but they inadvertently have an
            unfortunate effect on the debate about the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> order
            questions, for talk of paradigm shifts unduly polarizes
            the debate about the value of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EBM</ENAMEX>. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] Recall that
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kuhn</ENAMEX> describes a paradigm as the "entire constellation
            of beliefs, values, techniques, and so on shared by the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of a given <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX>". [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX> ] When <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">proponents</ENAMEX>
            of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EBM</ENAMEX> suggest that it is a new paradigm, this
            certainly fosters the impression that an entire set of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">beliefs</ENAMEX>, values, and techniques is to be left behind,
            and that the whole world of medical research and
            clinical practice is completely different than it was
            in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the days</TIMEX> before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EBM</ENAMEX> was recognized. This in turn
            strongly suggests that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> have a stark choice:
            accept the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX> and completely reject the old, or
            defensively hold on to the old and reject <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EBM</ENAMEX> entirely.
            If something as grand as a complete shift of paradigm
            is in the offing, then the old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX>, with their
            old understandings, training, and paradigm, are relics
            to be removed as soon as possible. The prospect of this
            kind of consequence would certainly lead to a defensive
            retrenchment and even anxiety. If you exaggerate the
            claims for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EBM</ENAMEX>, you intensify the natural defensiveness
            of those who feel themselves not to be completely in
            line with the new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regime</ENAMEX>. This is not a productive
            atmosphere in which to hold a debate about the merits
            of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EBM</ENAMEX>.
            In the next section, we suggest a different
            philosophical framework with which to examine the EBM
            debate. But we think that some progress would be made
            simply by avoiding overly broad definitions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EBM</ENAMEX> and
            by abandoning all talk of paradigm shifts.
          
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quine</ENAMEX> and the web of belief
          We can make more progress by turning away from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kuhn</ENAMEX>
          and turning to the work of philosopher of science, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">W.V.</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quine</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quine</ENAMEX> describes the totality of our beliefs - from
          ordinary common sense claims to the laws of physics - as
          a 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">web</ENAMEX> , and he thus speaks of the 
          web of belief . [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] A web, e.g.,
          a spider web, has an exterior edge or frame, and an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interior</ENAMEX>, consisting of radii and connecting points. At
          the edges, the web is secured to an already existing
          structure, e.g., a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> or wall. According to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">analogy</ENAMEX>, the web of belief comprises statements; certain
          of the statements are closer to the periphery or frame,
          which consists of our sensory experience.
          Those sentences that lie closest to the periphery of
          the web <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quine</ENAMEX> calls 
          observation sentences , while the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interior</ENAMEX> of the web contains more theoretical claims. The
          observation sentences are those that are more likely to
          be denied or affirmed on the basis of immediate sensory
          experience. For example, a quick glance out of the window
          will determine whether or not we accept the sentence "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">It</ENAMEX>
          is raining." With other sentences, we are much less
          immediately influenced by sensory experiences. For
          example, consider the sentence, "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald Reagan</ENAMEX> was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">President</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</TIMEX>." One might have a sensory experience
          that is apparently at odds with this sentence; one might
          see a list that includes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter Mondale</ENAMEX> as the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stPresident</ENAMEX> serving from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1985 through 1988</TIMEX>. But we would
          not allow such apparently recalcitrant sensory experience
          to change our minds about the original sentence. We would
          conclude instead that the list was simply wrong. This is
          not to say that the sentence "<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald Reagan</ENAMEX> was president
          in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</TIMEX>" is immune from all possibility of doubt;
          sufficient evidence might indeed convince us that the
          sentence is false. But <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> points are in order. First, it
          would take much more than a simple one-time observation
          of anything, and, <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>, we would have to change many
          other beliefs as well. This is characteristic of
          theoretical sentences within the sciences too: to
          convince us of the falsity of a firmly accepted claim, we
          will need repeated experiments with congruent results,
          and rejection of theoretical sentences typically requires
          the revision of many other related beliefs. Some
          theoretical claims will be even closer to the center of
          the web, e.g., laws of nature like "<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">E=mc 2</ENAMEX>" and laws of
          logic or mathematics. According to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quine</ENAMEX>, even claims as
          central as these are revisable. But because such claims
          are connected to so many other beliefs, their rejection
          would typically require revision to many, many sentences
          within the web.
          So according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quinean</ENAMEX> metaphor, we use a vast
          network or web of beliefs with intricate logical and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">evidential</ENAMEX> relations; at the periphery of the web are the
          observation sentences, which represent claims that are
          the most dependent on sensory observation. In the medical
          context, observation sentences would include simple
          findings during a physical examination, e.g., a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s
          temperature or blood pressure. Moving inward from the
          periphery of the web would be hypotheses about these
          findings, e.g., that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> has an infection, or
          that if the systolic pressure is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">160</NUMEX> mmHg, we should
          repeat the measurement before concluding that it
          represents that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s normal blood pressure. Even
          further towards the interior of the web would be theories
          about disease occurrence, e.g., that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIV</ENAMEX> is a retrovirus
          that targets CD4(+) T cells; that the differential
          diagnosis of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hypertension</ENAMEX> includes idiopathic, renal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">stenosis</ENAMEX> and even pheochromocytoma; even further in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interior</ENAMEX> would be very general claims, e.g., the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">physiological</ENAMEX> model for elevated blood pressure or the
          germ theory of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>.
          It is important to note that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quine</ENAMEX> is 
          not suggesting a foundationalist
          picture, according to which we build our theory on
          supposedly indubitable reports of sensory experience.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quine</ENAMEX> writes:
          Any statement can be held true come what may, if we
          make drastic enough adjustments elsewhere in the system.
          Even a statement very close to the periphery can be held
          true in the face of recalcitrant experience by pleading
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hallucination</ENAMEX> or by amending certain statements of the
          kind called logical laws. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ]
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quine</ENAMEX>'s central claims is "that our statements
          about the external world face the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">tribunal</ENAMEX> of sense
          experience not individually but only as a corporate
          body". [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] Thus our theories are put to the test as a
          whole; we cannot simply test individual claims in
          isolation from the rest of our theory. This <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Quinean</ENAMEX> view,
          which seems to us perfectly correct, is sometimes
          referred to as 
          holism , or as the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Quine</ENAMEX>-Duhem
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">thesis</ENAMEX> (for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierre Duhem</ENAMEX> had argued for a similar view. [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> ] ).
          Nonetheless, observation sentences do have a certain
          privileged status. Observation sentences are those that
          are most directly tied to our immediate sensory
          experience; given the right sensory experience, all
          competent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observers</ENAMEX> fluent in our language will
          unhesitatingly assent to the appropriate observation
          sentence. For example, while looking at a thermometer,
          all competent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observers</ENAMEX> could agree that it reads <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37.0</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C.</ENAMEX>; and given the right visual, aural, and tactile
          stimuli while using a sphygmomanometer, all competent
          medical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">professionals</ENAMEX> could agree that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s
          blood pressure is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">130/80</NUMEX> mmHg at the time of the
          measurement. Having made such observations, we will also
          be very reluctant to change our minds about the truth of
          those sentences. Of course, we might well come to
          conclude that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s blood pressure has 
          changed , or that the reading does
          not represent the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s normal blood pressure (if,
          for example, we had reason to think that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> was
          under stress at the time). However, having made our
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">observation</ENAMEX>, we will remain quite confident that the
          original reading was correct at the time. Naturally, we
          might be forced by other observations to conclude that we
          had misread the sphygmomanometer, the cuff was wrongly
          inflated, or even that the instrument was not functioning
          properly. But in general, we will be very reluctant to
          reject a previously accepted observation sentence. Our
          developing scientific theory must somehow accommodate the
          observation sentences we accept. In this sense, sensory
          experience and observation sentences are the ultimate
          checkpoint for scientific theory; they are that which
          secures the web to fixed ground.
        
        
          Application to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EBM</ENAMEX> and the alternatives
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EBM</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Basic Science</ENAMEX>
            From our knowledge of human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">physiology</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, and
            pharmacology we might be able to infer whether a
            particular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> would be effective in treating a given
            condition. With the basic science approach, we work up
            from our knowledge of physiology and biochemistry to a
            prediction of what will happen. Clinical trials
            essentially ignore, or suspend temporarily, all of that
            and determine whether a treatment works by 
            trying the treatment in a large
            number of cases under controlled conditions.
            Basic science and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCTs</ENAMEX> thus represent <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> different
            paths to answering intervention questions. Seen
            explicitly in terms of the web metaphor, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCTs</ENAMEX> seem to
            take the shortest path possible from the periphery of
            the web towards <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-</TIMEX>web space where clinical
            decisions are made. Within the course of a clinical
            trial, we will make observation statements that seem
            very directly relevant to our original treatment
            question, for we will be observing clinical endpoints
            for other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with condition <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX> when given
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">treatment X.</ENAMEX> The basic science approach, on the other
            hand, looks rather different. On the basis of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">biochemistry</ENAMEX> and physiology, we might predict certain
            clinical endpoints for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with condition <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Y</ENAMEX> when
            given treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">X.</ENAMEX> These predictions will be based on a
            very different set of observation statements than those
            involved in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCTs</ENAMEX>. The observation statements that
            ultimately support the basic science approach will be
            those that support our knowledge of biochemistry and
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">physiology</ENAMEX>.
            Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EBM</ENAMEX> and the basic sciences embody different
            approaches, this does not mean that they are
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">competitors</ENAMEX>. In fact, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> approaches need each
            other; neither can stand alone. This is perhaps easiest
            to see with basic science. If basic science could give
            us perfect confidence in the safety and efficacy of an
            intervention, then clinical trials would indeed be
            theoretically superfluous. However, we rarely, if ever,
            can be certain of both the safety and efficacy of a
            treatment without clinical testing, for our knowledge
            of the human body and how it interacts with the
            environment is far from complete.
            While it is perhaps less obvious, the method of
            clinical trials is also not able to stand alone. RCTs
            can sometimes give us confident answers to intervention
            questions even when our basic scientific knowledge is
            insufficient for this purpose (e.g., on many questions
            concerning diet and exercise); however, this does not
            mean that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCTs</ENAMEX> are completely independent of basic
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">science</ENAMEX>. If nothing else, a controlled trial needs a
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hypothesis</ENAMEX> to test. Typically, treatments will be
            suggested as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">candidates</ENAMEX> because of other more basic
            scientific research. A classic case of this is the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">accidental</ENAMEX> discovery of penicillin by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alexander</ENAMEX>
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fleming</ENAMEX>, though <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fleming</ENAMEX> himself initially paid little
            attention to the possible therapeutic uses of the mold.
            [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX> ] <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Contemporary</ENAMEX> basic scientific work on
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">thalidomide</ENAMEX> provides another example. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ]
            But there is also a more fundamental way in which
            <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">RCTs</ENAMEX> cannot stand apart from basic science. Even when a
            clinical trial returns positive results in the
            treatment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">arm</ENAMEX> that satisfy tests of statistical
            significance, we will have more confidence in these
            results when they have some antecedent biological
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">plausibility</ENAMEX>. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28 29</NUMEX> ] Put more generally, we would
            suggest that the degree of confidence appropriate for a
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clinically</ENAMEX> tested claim is a function of 
            both the strength of the clinical
            result and the claim's antecedent biological
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">plausibility</ENAMEX>. This relationship is perhaps obscured by
            cases in which we understand very little about the
            pharmacology of a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> (e.g., treatment of ulcerative
            colitis with sulfasalazine). In such cases, it is
            perfectly appropriate that strong clinical results
            yield a reasonably high degree of confidence. But we
            shouldn't forget that we would be even 
            more confident if the results
            were exactly what biochemistry and physiology would
            lead us to expect.
            More importantly yet, if the basic sciences gave us
            very strong reason to believe that a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> would 
            not be effective, then it is
            appropriate to be very cautious when interpreting
            apparently positive clinical results. For example,
            there have been some RCTs of homeopathic remedies
            according to which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> receiving the homeopathic
            remedy did better than those receiving a placebo, and
            where the P-values are less than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.05</NUMEX> or even less than
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">.001</NUMEX>. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] However, given that homeopathic remedies
            are typically composed of nothing more than <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>,
            accepted basic science should lead us to seriously
            doubt that these 'drugs' can be effective. In any
            event, we cannot simply accept that pure <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> (in the
            form of a homeopathic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX>) is medically effective
            unless we are also willing to revise much of our basic
            scientific conception of chemistry and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">body</ENAMEX>. The
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interior</ENAMEX> of the web acts as a compass we use to
            interpret the direction we should take from signals
            from a new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCT</ENAMEX>. 
            Statistical information from an RCT
            is virtually uninterpretable and meaningless if
            stripped away from the backdrop of our basic
            understanding of physiology and biochemistry. The
            dependence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCTs</ENAMEX> upon the backdrop of basic science
            is unsurprising from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quinean</ENAMEX> perspective. The point
            is essentially an application of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quinean</ENAMEX> doctrine
            of holism, the claim that our theories are put to the
            test as whole <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">bodies</ENAMEX> rather than being tested sentence
            by sentence. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tonelli</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Callahan</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] make a
            similar point about the need for theory in interpreting
            empirical results. However, they suggest that evidence
            concerning alternative <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medicine</ENAMEX> should be weighed and
            interpreted in terms of 
            its theory of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX>, e.g.,
            theories involving undetectable spirit essences or the
            like. This does not follow at all. If 
            we are judging the effectiveness
            of alternative medicinal therapies, then we evaluate
            the evidence in light of the theory about <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> that
            we believe to be true. It would be a silly and
            pointless exercise to evaluate evidence in light of a
            theory we believe to be false.)
            The dependence of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCTs</ENAMEX> on basic science appears not
            always to have been fully appreciated by some EBM
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">proponents</ENAMEX>. In some discussions of hierarchies of
            medical evidence, basic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">physiology</ENAMEX> and biochemistry is
            put at the very bottom or is ignored altogether. [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>
            <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX> ] Thus, these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">proponents</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EBM</ENAMEX> seem to say that we
            should 
            only look at evidence from RCTs
            (when we have it), and that medical practice is
            conducted in isolation of our understanding of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">physiology</ENAMEX> and biochemistry. We claim that such views
            are wrong. On the other hand, this is not to say that
            if a clinical result flies in the face of our
            physiological understanding that we should just reject
            it out of hand, as suggested by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Couto</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . In
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">general</ENAMEX>, given the complexity of the human body and our
            nascent knowledge of it, if we use basic science alone
            to judge the safety or efficacy of an intervention,
            then our judgment will be fraught with a high degree of
            uncertainty. For example, some laboratory evidence
            suggests that estrogen might have a positive effect on
            brain cells, and thus suggesting that hormone therapy
            might help to ward off dementia. However, a recent
            controlled trial strongly suggests that whatever
            positive effect such <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">hormones</ENAMEX> have, these effects are
            outweighed by negative effects. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] On the other
            hand, in an extreme case like homeopathy, where the
            biological plausibility is so low, our background
            biological knowledge does and should affect our
            interpretation of the evidence from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCTs</ENAMEX>.
            The outcome of our discussion above is that basic
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">science</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EBM</ENAMEX> are deeply intertwined within the web
            and complementary. In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quinean</ENAMEX> terms, each of these
            represents a different path to the intervention
            question through the web of belief. We clearly need
            both approaches. Which of the approaches should receive
            the greater share of our limited health care resources?
            There is little useful to be said about this question
            at this level of generality. The best allocation of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resources</ENAMEX> is affected by a broad range of contextual
            factors.
          
          
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EBM</ENAMEX> and the other alternatives
            As noted earlier in the discussion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kuhn</ENAMEX>, clinical
            experience, observational studies, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCTs</ENAMEX> have much
            in common. All are attempting to ascertain the safety
            and efficacy of interventions, and all do so by trying
            the intervention and noting the results. From the
            Quinean perspective, we could also say that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX>
            are anchored to observation statements at the periphery
            of the web in similar ways. In each case, we will
            observe the treatment received by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>, and then
            we will observe the outcome or endpoint for each
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>. Of course, in an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCT</ENAMEX>, we place restrictions on
            the way data are gathered: we require that there be a
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who do not receive the target
            experimental therapy, and that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> are randomly
            assigned to either the control or experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>;
            we typically 'blind' <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> (and other
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>), by not allowing them to know, during the
            course of the study, which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> are in the control
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX>; and we blind the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> themselves, so that
            they do not know which therapy they received. In this
            <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">section</ENAMEX>, we will look at how these restrictions are to
            be understood and justified from the perspective of the
            Quinean metaphor.
            In observational studies or clinical experience, the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">physician</ENAMEX> knows which <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> received the therapy or
            exposure, and then observes the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s subsequent
            condition. Thus, statements about the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s
            condition constitute the evidential base, and these
            statements are treated as observation sentences. But
            recall that an observation sentence is one that would
            elicit assent from any competent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observer</ENAMEX>. The advocate
            of double-blind trials contends, in effect, that simple
            statements about the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>' condition are not
            observation sentences after all, for the sentence might
            
            not elicit assent from all
            competent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observers</ENAMEX> - especially for 'soft' end points
            such as pain scales. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Physicians</ENAMEX> may be unconsciously
            biased in favor of seeing or eliciting a treatment
            effect when none exists. A <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">doctor</ENAMEX> who knows that the
            patient has received a certain therapy, and who thinks
            that the therapy is likely to be effective, might make
            observations that would not be made by a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX> who
            knew nothing of the treatment. So the criticism of
            clinical experience and observational studies is this:
            the evidence in those cases is tainted in that
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> take certain sentences about the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s
            condition to be observation sentences (and hence firm
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">checkpoints</ENAMEX>) when in fact they do not qualify as
            observation sentences. Hence, according to the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">proponent</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EBM</ENAMEX>, the conclusions reached through
            clinical experience are less reliable.
            In a double-blind trial, we also blind <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> from
            information about what sort of therapy they received.
            Here, the main <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> is not that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> will be
            subconsciously biased in reporting their condition -
            though this might be a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> in some cases. The issue
            is very different: we want to rule out placebo effects
            (or the "meaning response" [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] ), meaning that we
            want exclude the possibility that the observed effect
            stemmed from the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s 
            belief that she was given a
            particular therapy. We might have reliable observation
            sentences about the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s subsequent condition,
            but, unless we control for placebo effects, the
            improvement in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s condition might have nothing
            to do with the actual treatment received. In Quinean
            terms, in an uncontrolled study, the observation
            statements (about the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s condition) and the
            theoretical statement (about the efficacy of the
            treatment) may be linked too tenuously along the radii
            of the web; in the extreme case, the apparent linkage
            may be purely by chance. If we control the conditions
            under which we make observations, we can then compare
            the observation statements concerning the condition of
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who received the treatment with statements
            concerning <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who received a placebo. In other
            words, we use observation sentences similar to those
            that would be obtained in clinical experience, but we
            are more careful in the inferences we draw from these
            statements. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EBM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">proponent</ENAMEX> contends that by
            including observations about <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in the control
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX>, we put ourselves on firmer ground in determining
            the efficacy of the treatment; thus the web is
            strengthened.
            Perhaps the most basic feature of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCT</ENAMEX> is the use
            of randomized control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. When research is done
            without using control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> at all, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researchers</ENAMEX> might
            <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">infer</ENAMEX> treatment was effective, when in fact the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s condition would have waned on its own or
            would have improved just as much with the standard
            therapy. In other words, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EBM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">proponent</ENAMEX> claims that
            in the 
            absence of a control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>, the
            inference from observation statements (about the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s condition) to the conclusion (about the
            efficacy of the intervention) is greatly weakened.
            Moreover, if we do not 
            randomly assign <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> to
            either the experimental or control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, then we
            again run the risk of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">researcher</ENAMEX> bias affecting the
            outcome, e.g., by selecting <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> for the
            experimental <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> who have the best chance of
            improvement.
            Returning to the first-order, normative question, we
            can now ask to what extent should <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> rely on
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCTs</ENAMEX> as opposed to clinical experience or observational
            studies. Unlike the comparison with basic science, we
            cannot simply say that they are complementary and that
            we need both. As discussed above, observational studies
            essentially are clinical experience made systematic,
            and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCTs</ENAMEX> are observational studies subject to further
            controls. The extra time and expense involved in
            performing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCTs</ENAMEX> is justified only if their answers to
            intervention questions are more likely to be true. For
            the reasons laid out in the preceding paragraphs, the
            <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">proponent</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EBM</ENAMEX> contends that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCTs</ENAMEX> are indeed more
            reliable than the alternatives. We are inclined to
            agree. It is clear that for clinical experience and
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">observational</ENAMEX> studies, there is a risk of different
            sorts of bias; in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quinean</ENAMEX> terms, the controls imposed
            by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCTs</ENAMEX> give us firmer observational checkpoints and
            stronger inferences from observations to conclusions,
            particular conclusions about interventions. Experience
            confirms that uncontrolled studies can give different
            results than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCTs</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35 36</NUMEX> ] ; the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Quinean</ENAMEX> analysis
            gives a diagnosis of those differences.
            Still, that doesn't mean we should reject clinical
            experience or observational studies altogether. Much of
            our web of medical theory was spun from these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>.
            Moreover, as a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">authors</ENAMEX> have pointed out,
            there are significant limitations on when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCTs</ENAMEX> are
            practical or even ethical. Where limitations of this
            sort intervene, we have to do the best we can, and that
            means relying on the experience we have through
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">observational</ENAMEX> studies and clinical experience, even
            though we know that there may be problems of bias and
            selective memory, etc. If there are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EBM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">proponents</ENAMEX> who
            thinks that medical practice can be reduced to an
            <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">algorithmic</ENAMEX> application of evidence from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCTs</ENAMEX>, they are
            certainly mistaken. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ]
          
        
      
      
        Summary
        Because we wished to clarify the debate about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EBM</ENAMEX>, we
        have spent the bulk of this paper exploring the
        second-order conceptual questions concerning the nature of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EBM</ENAMEX>. We have argued that it is both a philosophical and
        practical mistake to see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EBM</ENAMEX> as a paradigm shift. We have
        also attempted to explain the differences between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EBM</ENAMEX> and
        its alternatives in terms of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Quine</ENAMEX>'s metaphor of the web of
        belief. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EBM</ENAMEX> and the basic sciences offer different paths
        through the web to claims about intervention safety and
        efficacy: each begins with a very different set of
        observation statements as its evidential checkpoint;
        however, neither is completely self-standing and
        independent. There is a sharper contrast between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EBM</ENAMEX> and
        the methods of clinical experience and observational
        studies, according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EBM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">proponent</ENAMEX>: uncontrolled
        studies take certain reports of clinical endpoints as
        observation sentences - i.e., sentences that would be
        agreed to by all competent <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">observers</ENAMEX>, sentences that are
        the checkpoint and basis for science - when in fact some of
        those reports do not count as observation sentences; and in
        other cases, uncontrolled studies may base their
        conclusions on observation sentences that are too tenuously
        linked to the claimed result, resulting in a 
        post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy.
        This does not mean that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCTs</ENAMEX> are always appropriate or are
        always feasible, and there is much more to be said about
        the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> order questions of when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RCTs</ENAMEX> are worth the time
        and expense. But we can only have that discussion when we
        are clear about the nature of the questions themselves.
