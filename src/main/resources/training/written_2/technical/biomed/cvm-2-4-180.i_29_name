        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MI</ENAMEX> is an important end-point in clinical trials. The
        prevention of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MI</ENAMEX> has in fact been the primary treatment
        effect assessed in recent trials of antiplatelet and
        antithrombin therapies [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10</ENAMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CECs</ENAMEX> are now commonly used to adjudicate suspected
        end-point events in cardiovascular clinical trials. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Limited</ENAMEX>
        information has, however, been published about the
        classification of the cause of death [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12, 13, 14, 15, 16</TIMEX>]
        or the adjudication of nonfatal end-points [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17, 18, 19</TIMEX>,
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20, 21, 22, 23, 24</TIMEX>] in these trials. The rates of end-point
        events can vary considerably depending on whether
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committees</ENAMEX> merely confirm events reported by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX>
        or whether they adjudicate all suspected events identified
        by data screening.
        In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PURSUIT</ENAMEX> trial [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>], a central, independent CEC
        systematically identified and adjudicated all suspected
        non-fatal MIs that occurred after enrolment and through a
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30-day</TIMEX> follow-up. The rationale for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CEC</ENAMEX> adjudication was
        the need for a systematic, unbiased, independent, and
        standard assessment of this end-point in a large,
        international trial. To understand the role of such a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">committee</ENAMEX>, and to provide recommendations for future
        efforts, we reviewed the results of the CEC process used in
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PURSUIT</ENAMEX> trial to identify and adjudicate suspected
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">end-point MIs</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Methods
        
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PURSUIT</ENAMEX> trial
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PURSUIT</ENAMEX> trial [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>] enrolled <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,948</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">726</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North America</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Latin</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Western Europe</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eastern Europe</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX>
          with acute coronary syndromes without persistent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ST</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">segment</ENAMEX> elevation were randomly assigned to placebo or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eptifibatide</ENAMEX>. The inclusion and exclusion criteria, as
          well as treatment regimens, have been published elsewhere
          [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>]. The primary end-point was a composite of death or
          non-fatal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MI</ENAMEX> (or reinfarction in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MI</ENAMEX> at
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">enrolment</ENAMEX>) by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30-day</TIMEX> follow-up as adjudicated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CEC</ENAMEX>.
          The composite end-point was also calculated using the
          site <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigator determination</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MI</ENAMEX> from case report
          forms. We assessed the incidence of end-point
          (post-enrolment) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MI</ENAMEX> among all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10,948</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> enrolled in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PURSUIT</ENAMEX> trial.
        
        
          End-point definitions
          The definition of end-point <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MI</ENAMEX> included a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> MI
          (for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> without <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MI</ENAMEX> at enrolment) or reinfarction
          (for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who had a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MI</ENAMEX> at enrolment), according to
          clinical, electrocardiography (ECG), and laboratory
          criteria (see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Appendix</ENAMEX>). A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MI</ENAMEX> present at enrolment was
          not considered an end-point <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MI</ENAMEX> and was not adjudicated by
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CEC</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> collection
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> were collected using standard case report forms.
          Additional information collected from all patients
          included cardiac enzymes, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECGs</ENAMEX> (performed at the time of
          the qualifying episode, at enrolment, at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX>, at
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> discharge, and at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30-day</TIMEX> follow-up),
          revascularisation procedure reports, details of ischemic
          episodes, clinical complications, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medications</ENAMEX>, and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">readmission</ENAMEX> records. All enzyme values for each patient
          were reported; study monitors then verified them against
          source documents. Site <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> were asked to submit
          supporting documents for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with suspected <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MI</ENAMEX>,
          which included discharge summaries and additional ECGs
          during the suspected event. Progress notes and procedure
          notes were also collected if necessary. An independent,
          blinded core laboratory read the specified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECGs</ENAMEX> and
          identified suspected <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MIs</ENAMEX>, defined as new Q waves â‰<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">¥ 0.04</NUMEX> s
          in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> contiguous leads. Overall, data for creatine
          kinase-myocardial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">band</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CK-MB</ENAMEX>) were missing for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 26</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.2%</NUMEX>), data for baseline <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECG</ENAMEX> were missing for
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.4%</NUMEX>), and data for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later</TIMEX> ECGs were missing
          for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.3%</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Process for event adjudication
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CEC</ENAMEX> was a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> dedicated to event adjudication
          within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">North American Trial Co</ENAMEX>-ordinating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Centre</ENAMEX> at
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Duke Clinical Research Institute</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> consisted
          of a managing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">supervisor</ENAMEX>, clinical <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">coordinators</ENAMEX> with a
          nursing or clinical research background, administrative
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">assistants</ENAMEX>, cardiology <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">fellows</ENAMEX>, and cardiology faculty
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CEC</ENAMEX> helped define clinical end-point events,
          helped develop computer algorithms to identify patients
          with suspected end-point events from data from case
          report forms, worked with monitoring <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> to collect
          supplemental medical records for event review, and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">adjudicated</ENAMEX> suspected clinical end-point events.
          A schematic diagram of the clinical event adjudication
          process is shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. Computer algorithms
          systematically identified key variables from the database
          that could indicate the occurrence of a post-enrolment
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">end-point</NUMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MI</ENAMEX>. These variables, which were determined
          from clinical expertise and trial experience, included
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">elevated cardiac enzymes</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECG</ENAMEX> core laboratory
          identification of suspected <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MI</ENAMEX>, recurrent ischemic
          events, urgent revascularisations, or site investigator
          assessment of a post-enrolment <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MI</ENAMEX>. The system was
          designed for broad identification of all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
          possible <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MI</ENAMEX> after enrolment. A report of all patients
          with suspected end-point <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MI</ENAMEX> was generated according to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'hits</ENAMEX>' on the variables already listed.
          Each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> with a suspected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MI</ENAMEX> had a clinical folder
          prepared by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CEC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">staff</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Duke Clinical Research</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institute</ENAMEX>. Folders included the case report form and
          ancillary data forms, discharge summaries, cardiac enzyme
          results, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECGs</ENAMEX>, and a data worksheet that summarised
          clinical events, procedures, and cardiac enzyme
          information. Medical records were translated into <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>
          if necessary, using <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> literate in the other
          language when possible.
          Each case was reviewed independently by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">blinded</ENAMEX> to treatment in the phase I review. The case was
          classified as resolved if the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> agreed that a MI
          had or had not occurred. Cases in which there was
          disagreement between the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CEC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> were
          forwarded to a second-level (phase <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX>) review for
          adjudication by consensus of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committee</ENAMEX> of faculty
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cardiologists</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committee</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> were also
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">blinded</ENAMEX> to treatment and to the result of the phase I
          review. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Physicians</ENAMEX> could request additional medical
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">records</ENAMEX>, if necessary, to adjudicate a suspected event.
          If additional records were obtained, the case was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">re</ENAMEX>-reviewed to ensure that decisions were based on
          similar documents. For quality assurance, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> of the
          cases with agreement by the phase I <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> were
          reviewed in a blinded fashion by the phase II committee
          to determine whether there were any systematic
          inconsistencies with the phase I reviews. There were no
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">inconsistencies</ENAMEX> found.
        
        
          Statistical analysis
          Variables were summarised as percentages for
          dichotomous variables or medians (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">25th</ENAMEX> and 75th
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">percentiles</ENAMEX>) for continuous variables. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Î§ 2test</ENAMEX> was
          used to calculate 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> values.
        
      
      
        Results
        Overall, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5005</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with suspected <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MI</ENAMEX> after enrolment
        (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">46%</NUMEX>) were identified and adjudicated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CEC</ENAMEX>. Table
        1presents the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> enrolled and the number of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with an end-point <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MI</ENAMEX> identified by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CEC</ENAMEX> or the
        site, both or neither, by geographic region. The proportion
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MI</ENAMEX> adjudicated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CEC</ENAMEX> was similar in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North America</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latin America</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Western Europe</ENAMEX>, but tended
        to be higher in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eastern Europe</ENAMEX>.
        As expected, because of the rigorous effort by the CEC
        to identify all suspected <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MIs</ENAMEX> for adjudication, the process
        identified more end-point events than did the site
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eptifibatide</ENAMEX> reduced the incidence
        of death or MI in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PURSUIT</ENAMEX> trial by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.5%</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15.7%</NUMEX> versus
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14.2%</NUMEX>; 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.042</NUMEX>) at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30 days</TIMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>]. This
        benefit was driven primarily by a reduction in nonfatal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MI</ENAMEX>.
        We noted smaller absolute and relative treatment effects
        when the CEC-determined MI rates were used compared with
        the site <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigator</ENAMEX>-determined rates.
        The proportion of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> enrolled who had a suspected
        end-point <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MI</ENAMEX> ranged from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">41%</NUMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North America</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> in
        Western <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). Disagreements between the site
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigator</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CEC</ENAMEX> assessment of MI occurred in <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9%</NUMEX> of all
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> enrolled in the trial, or <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">983</NUMEX> of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5005</TIMEX> patients
        with suspected <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">MI</ENAMEX> adjudicated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CEC</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). Of
        these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">983</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with disagreements, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">816</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> had a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MI</ENAMEX> assessed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CEC</ENAMEX> but not by the site <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigator</ENAMEX>,
        and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">167</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> had a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MI</ENAMEX> identified by site investigators
        but not by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CEC</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Discussion
        The review of the clinical-events classification process
        in the current study raises some important issues for
        clinical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX>. First, the rates of end-point
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">infarction</ENAMEX> or re-infarction were higher than those reported
        in prior trials of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with acute coronary syndromes.
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CEC</ENAMEX> identified more events than the site
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</NUMEX>, the site <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigator</ENAMEX> and the CEC
        assessments of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MI</ENAMEX> disagreed for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20%</NUMEX> of the patients
        reviewed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CEC</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CECs</ENAMEX> have become an integral aspect of clinical trials
        of new therapies for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with acute coronary
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">syndromes</ENAMEX>. The primary function of these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">committees</ENAMEX> has
        been to systematically adjudicate nonfatal end-points such
        as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MI</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> large trials in these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> used
        mortality as the primary end-point; thus, standardised
        assessment of patient outcome was not required [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25, 26</TIMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX>]. More recent trials, however, have included nonfatal
        end-points such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MI</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">congestive heart failure</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">stroke</ENAMEX>, or
        safety measures as part of composite clinical end-points.
        Myocardial infarction has been considered a 'hard'
        end-point, but its assessment can be as difficult in
        clinical trials as it is in clinical practice, because
        clinical, <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECG</ENAMEX> data may conflict and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> often disagree whether a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> has suffered a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MI</ENAMEX>. An example of this difficulty is the evaluation of
        small enzyme elevations in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> undergoing percutaneous
        coronary intervention [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX>]. Although these low-level
        enzyme elevations are defined as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIs</ENAMEX> in many trial
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">protocols</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> do not consistently consider them to
        be infarctions in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> clinical practice and therefore may
        be reluctant to report them as such.
        The rates of infarction as adjudicated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CEC</ENAMEX> in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PURSUIT</ENAMEX> trial were higher than reported in previous trials
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with acute coronary syndromes, for several
        reasons [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 7, 8, 29</ENAMEX>]. First, the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">PURSUIT trial</ENAMEX> CEC effort
        was more liberal in its identification of possible events.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Committee</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> reviewed events for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">almost 50%</NUMEX> of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> in the trial, which is nearly double the
        percentage that underwent adjudication by the same CEC
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> other trials: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Integrilin</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Minimize Platelet</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aggregation</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Coronary Thrombosis</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IMPACT-II</ENAMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>], and
        Global Use of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Strategies</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Open Occluded Arteries in Acute</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Coronary Syndromes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GUSTO-IIb</ENAMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, the definition
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MI</ENAMEX> is evolving and has varied among clinical trials in
        this patient <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. For example, criteria for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MI</ENAMEX> after
        bypass surgery in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GUSTO-IIb</ENAMEX> trial were more stringent
        than those in the <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">PURSUIT trial</ENAMEX>, requiring <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> of three
        criteria to be met (CK or <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CK-MB fraction â‰¥ 5</ENAMEX> times the
        upper limit of normal, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> new Q waves, or new regional
        wall-motion abnormalities). Finally, more cardiac enzyme
        samples were collected per <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PURSUIT</ENAMEX> trial
        than in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GUSTO-IIb</ENAMEX> (median [<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">25 th</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">75</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">th</ENAMEX>] 4.5 [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3, 7</ENAMEX>] versus
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 4</ENAMEX>]) (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RAHarrington</ENAMEX>, unpublished data). These factors,
        particularly the systematic collection of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cardiac</ENAMEX> enzymes
        (missing for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 0.2%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>), contributed to a
        higher ascertainment of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MI</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PURSUIT</ENAMEX> trial. Trials
        that rely on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigator</ENAMEX>-reported <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MI</ENAMEX> probably
        underestimate the true event rate.
        Before implementation of the CEC process, the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Steering Committee</ENAMEX> agreed on the definitions
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MI</ENAMEX>, which were based on experience and clinical
        expertise. Because of the global nature of the PURSUIT
        investigation, attempts were made to model definitions
        after everyday clinical practice. The study protocol
        provided the end-point definitions, so that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CEC</ENAMEX> and
        site <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> had the same set of criteria to classify
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MI</ENAMEX>. Nevertheless, the site <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> underreported
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">infarctions</ENAMEX>. Similar findings have been noted in prior
        trials [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 9, 22</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23, 30, 31</TIMEX>].
        The strategy used to identify suspected <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">infarctions</ENAMEX> can
        affect the proportion of events with disagreements. Some
        trials have confirmed events reported only by the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5, 7, 8, 11</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29, 30</TIMEX>], whereas other trials
        have adjudicated all suspected events identified by
        systematic screening of patient data [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2, 3, 9, 31, 32</ENAMEX>].
        In the first strategy, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CEC</ENAMEX> event rates will be the same
        as or lower than the site <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigator</ENAMEX>-reported rates. In
        the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CEC</ENAMEX> event rates may be higher, lower, or
        the same as the site <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigator</ENAMEX>-reported rates.
        The impact of adjudication of cases from other regions
        of the world by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North America</ENAMEX> is
        unknown. In the current study, however, medical records
        were translated to <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> fluent in other
        languages were used when needed, and the criteria for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">re</ENAMEX>-infarction were based, for the most part, on objective
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> such as enzyme and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ECG</ENAMEX> data.
        There are several key implications of these findings.
        The strategy used to identify and adjudicate end-point
        events is one of many factors to be considered when

        comparing event rates between clinical studies. During
        trial planning, the events classification strategy being
        considered may also have an important impact on estimation
        of event rates and the calculations of sample size and
        power. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Education</ENAMEX> and training of clinical investigators
        regarding end-point definitions and ascertainment may help
        in minimising differences between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CEC</ENAMEX> and site investigator
        assessments of end-points. Finally, the strategy and rigor
        of the clinical event adjudication process used may
        influence the interpretation of trial results by the
        clinical and regulatory <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX>. We believe that CEC
        adjudication of suspected nonfatal MI end-point events is
        important to provide independent, unbiased, standard,
        systematic assessments, particularly in trials that include
        broad geographic regions and different clinical practice
        settings.
      
      
        Conclusion
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nonfatal MI</ENAMEX>, inherently undesirable, is an important
        clinical event and an important component of clinical trial
        end-points. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CEC</ENAMEX> adjudication of infarction is necessary to
        provide standardised, systematic, independent, and unbiased
        assessments of end-points in clinical investigation. In the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PURSUIT</ENAMEX> trial, the assessment of infarction by site
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> versus that of a central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">CEC</ENAMEX> disagreed: more
        infarctions were identified by the CEC than by the site
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX>. The impact of these findings affects the
        comparison of event rates between trials as well as the
        design of future trials.
