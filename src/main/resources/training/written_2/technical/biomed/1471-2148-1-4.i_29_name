        An emerging pattern found in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> and protein
        phylogenies that include prokaryotes (archaebacteria and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eubacteria</ENAMEX>) and eukaryotes is the variable position of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eukaryotes</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> involved in transcription and
        translation, eukaryotes often cluster with archaebacteria
        whereas in metabolic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> they often cluster with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eubacteria</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . Among the latter <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, eukaryotes
        sometimes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">α-proteobacteria</NUMEX>, presumably
        reflecting the origin of mitochondria, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> sometimes
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cluster</ENAMEX> with cyanobacteria, reflecting the origin of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">plastids</ENAMEX>. These patterns have been interpreted as a general
        signature of the symbiotic origin of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eukaryotes</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3</NUMEX> ] and
        horizontal gene transfer (HGT) of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">symbiont genes</ENAMEX> to the
        nucleus [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 5 6 7 8 9</NUMEX> ] . On the one hand, this complexity
        resulting from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HGT</ENAMEX> can obscure some aspects of evolutionary
        history [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . However, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HGT</ENAMEX> also can provide the means to
        investigate otherwise difficult questions, such as
        inferring the number of symbiotic events and estimating the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> of those events. This is the approach that we take in
        this study.
        The goal of this study is to estimate the timing of
        evolutionary events involved in the origin of eukaryotes
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>), including the related origin of oxygenic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">photosynthesis</ENAMEX>. The latter is believed to have occurred
        only in cyanobacteria [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] and preceded the symbiotic
        event leading to the mitochondrion of eukaryotes. The
        earliest biomarker evidence of eukaryotes is at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.7</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ga</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>
        ] and the earliest fossils appear <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ga</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . The
        fossil record of cyanobacteria has been argued to extend to
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ga</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] but the biomarker evidence at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.7</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.8</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ga</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> ] usually is considered to be the earliest record of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cyanobacteria</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . However, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-methylhopane
        biomarker of cyanobacteria has been detected in lower
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">abundance</ENAMEX> in other prokaryotes, and many taxa (especially
        anaerobic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>) have not been examined for the biomarker
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16 17</NUMEX> ] . Also, the origin of oxygenic photosynthesis
        may have occurred at some time later than the origin of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cyanobacteria</ENAMEX>. Geologic evidence bearing on the origin and
        rise in oxygen likewise has been debated [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 19</NUMEX> ] .
        Although the existence of banded iron formations prior to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ga</ENAMEX> sometimes has been used as evidence for the early
        evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX>-independent
        mechanisms of iron deposition are known [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] .
        The use of sequence changes to estimate the time of
        these early events also has its assumptions and limitations
        [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 22 23</NUMEX> ] . Nonetheless, many proteins contain conserved
        regions of amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid sequence</ENAMEX> throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">prokaryotes</TIMEX> and
        eukaryotes that permit alignment and analysis. The most
        extensive of these analyses have found that all major
        events related to the origin of eukaryotes occurred about
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.0</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ga</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5 21</ENAMEX> ] . This includes the divergence of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">archaebacteria</ENAMEX> and archaebacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in eukaryotes,
        the origin of cyanobacteria, and the divergence of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eubacteria</ENAMEX> and eubacterial <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in eukaryotes (the
        latter presumably reflecting symbiosis). However, these
        times were not adjusted for lineage-specific rate
        differences that have been discovered subsequently [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] .
        Here, we estimate the time of these events with protein
        sequences from complete genomes and consideration of
        lineage-specific rate variation.
      
      
        Results
        
          Rate differences
          The shape parameter (α) of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX> distribution used
          to account for rate variation among <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> was found to
          differ consistently between calibration taxa and the
          overall data set for each gene (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>), requiring a
          dual-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX> approach (see Methods). Also, eukaryotic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein sequences</ENAMEX> were found to have an increased rate of
          evolution compared with prokaryotic sequences regardless
          of their archaebacterial or eubacterial origin (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3A).
          Average eukaryote rates were <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.37</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AK</ENAMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.18</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BK-o</ENAMEX>), and
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.38</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BK-m</ENAMEX>) times the rate of the most closely related
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prokaryote</ENAMEX> in constant rate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.55</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.24</NUMEX>, and
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.56</NUMEX> in all <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, respectively). Besides this general
          pattern, which may reflect fundamental differences
          between prokaryotes and eukaryotes (e.g., recombination),
          there are further differences among eukaryotes. In
          comparing rates of evolution in eukaryotic sequences
          derived independently from eubacteria and archaebacteria
          in the same <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>, those derived from eubacteria (in
          all cases, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BK-o</ENAMEX>) were found to be evolving at roughly
          twice the rate as their archaebacteria-derived
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">counterparts</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3B). The slope was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.01</NUMEX> and the
          correlation coefficient was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.54</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> comparisons in
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>).
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> other rate comparisons were limited by a small
          number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>: eubacteria versus eukaryotes (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          A ) and eubacteria versus
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">archaebacteria</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> were available in the
          first comparison and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> showed a faster rate in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eukaryotes</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.43</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.12</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.23</NUMEX>; x = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.26</NUMEX>). This result
          differs from that reported elsewhere [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] , in which
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> rates were not significantly different. In the
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> case, we found that archaebacteria are evolving at
          a slower rate than eubacteria, as was noted elsewhere [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX> ] . In our case, regression of archaebacterial branch
          length versus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eubacterial</NUMEX> branch length, fixed through
          the origin, resulted in a slope of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.93</NUMEX> and correlation
          coefficient of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.65</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>). However, in both of
          these comparisons, rate tests did not yield significant
          rate differences probably because of the short length of
          most <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. Sample size (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> sets) also was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">limited</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kollman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Doolittle</ENAMEX> study [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . Taken
          together these data suggest the following relative order
          of rate differences: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">archaebacteria < eubacteria <</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eukaryotes</ENAMEX> (archaebacterial origin) < eukaryotes
          (eubacterial origin). As additional genomic data become
          available, more <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> will be useful and greater
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">precision</ENAMEX> in these rates and rate differences will be
          possible.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phylogeny</ENAMEX> and time estimation
          It has been suggested that eukaryotic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> of archaebacterial origin are more closely
          related to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> lineage of archaebacteria (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crenarchaeota</ENAMEX>;
          "eocytes") than the other major lineage (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Euryarchaeota</ENAMEX>) [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> ] . If true, this would bear on our time estimate for
          the divergence of archaebacteria and eukaryotes. Thus, we
          conducted a phylogenetic analysis of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">72</NUMEX> proteins
          containing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> major <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of
          archaebacteria, eukaryotes, and eubacteria. At the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX>
          bootstrap significance level, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> supported
          archaebacterial monophyly whereas none supported the
          eocyte hypothesis (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crenarchaeota</ENAMEX> + <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eukaryota</ENAMEX>). This
          indicates that the lineage of archaebacteria leading to
          the eukaryote nuclear genome diverged prior to the split
          between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crenarchaeota</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Euryarchaeota</ENAMEX>. As noted
          previously [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] , most (in this case, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX>)
          eukaryotic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with archaebacterial affinity are
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">informational</ENAMEX> (involved in transcription, translation,
          and related processes).
          Among <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">41</NUMEX> eukaryotic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with eubacterial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">affinities,</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rickettsia</ENAMEX> is most closely related
          to eukaryotes in phylogenetic analyses of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> individual
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. This agrees with the genetic and cell
          biological evidence implicating an α-proteobacterium as
          progenitor of the mitochondrion [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] and supports the
          hypothesis that these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> eukaryotic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> owe their
          origin to that symbiotic event [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] . However, the
          remaining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> do not show this pattern but
          instead identify other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of eubacteria as
          closest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relative</ENAMEX>. Unlike 
          Rickettsia , no other single
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">species</ENAMEX> appears as closest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relative</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">more than three</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX>, but rather most (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19/32</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>) identify
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> as closest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relative</ENAMEX> (e.g, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4A). To
          further explore this question we combined sequences of
          all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with a full representation of eubacterial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">taxa</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>). In the combined analysis, eukaryotes
          fall significantly outside of the well-defined clade
          containing <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">α- and γ-proteobacteria</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4B). The
          relatively basal and unresolved position of eukaryotes is
          consistent with the preponderance of single proteins
          showing different <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> as closest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">relative</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> individual <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> showed significant bootstrap
          support for a 
          Rickettsia -eukaryote cluster in
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-taxon analyses (rooted with an archaebacterium)
          whereas <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> proteins significantly supported a 
          Rickettsia-Escherichia cluster that
          excluded the eukaryote.
          Divergence time estimates from the multigene (MG) and
          average distance (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AD</ENAMEX>) approaches are similar, but
          rate-adjusted times are older than unadjusted times
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). The time estimate for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AK</ENAMEX> divergence
          averages <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4.0</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ga</ENAMEX> and the remaining times range from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.8</NUMEX> to
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.7</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ga.</ENAMEX> The time estimate for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BK</ENAMEX>-o (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.7</NUMEX> ± <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ga</ENAMEX>) was
          older than the estimate for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BK-m</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.8</NUMEX> ± <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.20</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ga</ENAMEX>) whereas
          the time estimate for the origin of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giardia</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.2</NUMEX> ± <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.12</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ga</ENAMEX>) was intermediate. The BC time estimate was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.6</NUMEX> ± <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.26</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Ga.</ENAMEX>
        
      
      
        Discussion
        The purpose of this study was to examine the temporal
        relationship between the origin of eukaryotes and events in
        Earth history. However, some unexpected results required
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">refinement</ENAMEX> in methodology. These included finding greater
        among-site rate variation in the calibration <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> and
        different rates of sequence change between prokaryotes and
        eukaryotes, and between <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eukaryotes</ENAMEX> derived from different
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of prokaryotes. By taking into account these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">variables</ENAMEX>, the resulting time estimates are more robust and
        have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">fewer</NUMEX> assumptions. For example, the time estimate for
        the origin of eukaryotes (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BK-o</ENAMEX>) is not based on a general
        assumption of rate constancy between prokaryotes (or even
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eubacteria</ENAMEX>) and eukaryotes because rates are adjusted for
        each <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> and each comparison. Also, the calibration
        used for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BK</ENAMEX>-o is not a general eukaryotic calibration but
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> based exclusively on eukaryote <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sequences</ENAMEX> derived from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eubacteria</ENAMEX>. A tradeoff in these improved methods was a
        reduction in the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that could be used,
        which increased the variance of the time estimates.
        Nonetheless, the phylogenies and time estimates obtained in
        this study have a bearing on current models for the
        evolution of eukaryotes.
        Until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">about five years ago</TIMEX>, it was generally accepted
        that there was a prior <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">period</TIMEX> (before mitochondria) in the
        history of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eukaryotes</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2 26</ENAMEX> ] . The basal position of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">eukaryotes</ENAMEX> lacking mitochondria (amitochondriate) in
        phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX> ] was consistent with this
        supposition as was evidence from sequence signatures [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ]
        . However, molecular phylogenetic studies of several
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</TIMEX> have suggested that some or all
        amitochondriate eukaryotes once possessed mitochondria in
        the past [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . Based on this new evidence, most current
        models for the origin of eukaryotes assume only a single
        symbiotic or fusion event between an archaebacterium and an
        α-proteobacterium [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8 28 29</ENAMEX> ] .
        Under the single-symbiosis model, eukaryotes should
        cluster exclusively with an <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">α-proteobacterium</NUMEX> (e.g., 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rickettsia</ENAMEX> ), among eubacteria.
        However, our phylogenetic analyses (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) instead
        indicate, significantly, that many eukaryotic proteins
        originated from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> (or more) eubacterial lineages other
        than α-proteobacteria. The reduced genome of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rickettsia</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] would not explain
        this result because 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rickettsia</ENAMEX> possesses all of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> used in the combined analysis (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4B). <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Protein</ENAMEX>
        function and location also are consistent with a
        premitochondrial origin. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only one</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BK</ENAMEX>-o proteins
        is restricted to the mitochondrion whereas <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> of the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BK</ENAMEX>-m <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are restricted to that organelle. Also,
        all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> involved in cellular respiration
        are in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BK-m</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. Based on the serial endosymbiosis
        theory, the first symbiotic event involved a spirochete [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
        ] . On the other hand, sequence signatures of the heat
        shock molecular <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">chaperone protein</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HSP-70</ENAMEX> and other evidence
        have indicated that the first symbiotic event involved a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gram</ENAMEX>-negative eubacterium [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . Our data are unable to
        distinguish between these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> alternatives but agree with
        both in implicating an earlier, premitochondrial event.
        Predation by prokaryotes on early eukaryotes also may have
        led to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HGT</ENAMEX>.
        If <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> or more symbiotic events were involved, this does
        not necessarily confirm that any of the living lineages of
        amitochondriate eukaryotes arose prior to the second
        (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">mitochondrial</NUMEX>) event. All may have once possessed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mitochondria</ENAMEX>. However, because 
        Giardia arose at an early time (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branches</ENAMEX> near the base of the eukaryote phylogeny,
        the simplest explanation is that it never possessed
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mitochondria</ENAMEX> and is a primary (not secondary)
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">amitochondriate</ENAMEX>. Although the position of 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giardia</ENAMEX> in some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein phylogenies</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> ] has been proposed as evidence that it is a secondary
        amitochondriate, others have urged caution until
        additional, more conclusive, data become available [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ]
        .
        The number of symbiotic events was important for our
        primary <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concern</ENAMEX> of estimating a timescale for the early
        evolution of eukaryotes. We find that the divergence
        between archaebacteria and the lineage leading to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eukaryotes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        A ) was quite early (~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ga</ENAMEX>), which is
        about the time of the earliest biomarker evidence of life
        (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.9</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.8</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ga</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] . We interpret that divergence to be a
        speciation event between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> lineages of archaebacteria,
        with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
        A not becoming "eukaryotic" until the
        <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> symbiotic event at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.7</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ga.</ENAMEX> The remaining time
        estimates cluster around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-</TIMEX>life of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.8</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.7</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ga</ENAMEX>). The order of those events falls in a logical sequence:
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BK</ENAMEX>-o, BC, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BK-m.</ENAMEX> For example, the origin of mitochondria
        appears as the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> (not first) symbiotic event, and the
        origin of cyanobacteria comes before the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX>-utilizing
        organelles, mitochondria. Moreover, the timing of these
        biological events is consistent with the timing of events
        in geologic and atmospheric history (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>). Cyanobacteria
        appear before the major (undisputed) evidence of the rise
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.4</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ga</ENAMEX>) and mitochondria appear after the
        rise in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX>. Also, the estimates for the origin of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cyanobacteria</ENAMEX> and eukaryotes are consistent (within <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SE</ENAMEX>)
        with the earliest biomarker evidence for those <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> groups
        (~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.7</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ga.</ENAMEX>) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 15</NUMEX> ] . Phylogenetic analyses of
        photosynthetic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> and sequence signatures also support a
        relatively late order of appearance of cyanobacteria among
        photosynthetic prokaryotes [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">32 33</NUMEX> ] .
        Extensive glaciations occurred in the Paleoproterozoic
        (~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ga</ENAMEX>), and may have been global in extent [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] . It
        has been proposed that a major rise in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX> at this time
        lowered global temperatures and may have triggered the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">glaciations</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] . If this is true, and given the time
        estimates here, the evolutionary innovation of oxygenic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">photosynthesis</ENAMEX> may have had a relatively rapid impact on
        the environment. Moreover, this innovation may have caused
        a mass extinction of prokaryotes at that time, as a result
        of the toxic effects of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">oxygen</ENAMEX>, as suggested by the virtual
        absence of lineages prior to ~<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ga</ENAMEX> and subsequent rapid
        radiation of lineages (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Figs. 4, 5</ENAMEX>).
      
      
        Conclusions
        Our analyses of prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomic
        sequence data support <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> symbiotic events in the origin of
        eukaryotes: <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> premitochondrial (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.7 billion</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX>,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ga</ENAMEX>) and a later mitochondrial event (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.8</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ga</ENAMEX>). Our time
        estimate for the divergence of an early-branching eukaryote
        ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giardia</ENAMEX> ) that lacks mitochondria,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ga</ENAMEX>, suggests that it is a primary and not secondary
        amitochondriate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX>. Our time estimate for the origin
        of cyanobacteria (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ga</ENAMEX>) is more recent than expected and
        suggests <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that earlier</TIMEX> fossils claimed to be of
        cyanobacteria are of other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> (or artifacts).
        Moreover, the appearance of cyanobacteria immediately prior
        to the earliest undisputed evidence for the presence of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">oxygen</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.4</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ga</ENAMEX>) suggests that the innovation of
        oxygenic photosynthesis had a relatively rapid impact on
        the environment as it set the stage for further evolution
        of the eukaryotic <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX>.

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Crenarchaeota</ENAMEX>) became available during completion of
          study and was included in phylogenetic analyses only.
          Global alignment algorithms differ from local
          alignment algorithms in that they sometimes align
          unrelated (non-homologous) <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> together with homologous
          sites. Using a computational tool, xcons [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] , such
          unrelated <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> were removed from these CLUSTALW [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ]
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alignments</ENAMEX> to increase probability of site homology.
          During construction of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> alignments using the WAT
          system [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] , short fragmented sequences were manually
          removed. Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">204</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that could be calibrated for
          time estimation, the orthology of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">roughly half</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">116</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX>) was ambiguous for unknown reasons (e.g.,
          lateral gene transfer, gene loss, or poor phylogenetic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">resolution</ENAMEX>) leaving <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">87</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> for phylogeny and time
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">estimation</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> shortest (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY"><75</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>) of
          those were used only in phylogenetic analyses; the
          remaining <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> averaged <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">196</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> each. Where
          possible, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> were rooted by duplicate proteins
          (duplicate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX>); otherwise, they were
          midpoint-rooted.
          Separately, for timing the origin of 
          Giardia , sequences of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> proteins
          were obtained from the public databases and aligned [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37</NUMEX>
          ] in which the following taxa were available: 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giardia</ENAMEX> and other eukaryotes
          (including calibration taxa; see below), archaebacteria,
          and eubacteria. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Correspondence</ENAMEX> and requests for materials

          Time estimation
          Methods are described elsewhere [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] except as
          follows. Our initial goal was to estimate divergence
          times for the last common ancestor (LCA), the divergence
          between archaebacteria and eukaryotes (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AK</ENAMEX>), cyanobacteria
          and closest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">eubacterial relatives</ENAMEX> (origin of
          cyanobacteria, BC), eubacteria and mitochondrial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eukaryotes</ENAMEX> (origin of mitochondria, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BK-m</ENAMEX>), and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giardia</ENAMEX> and other eukaryotes (GK)
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). The importance of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Giardia</ENAMEX> is its lack of mitochondria
          and basal location in many phylogenies of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">eukaryotes</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39</NUMEX> ] .
          However, our initial phylogenetic analyses revealed
          that many <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">eukaryotes</ENAMEX> did not cluster with 
          Rickettsia, the α-proteobacterium,
          as predicted by current genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8 25</ENAMEX> ] .
          Instead, they typically formed a <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">basal</ENAMEX> lineage among
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eubacteria</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">tree</ENAMEX>. This result was consistent with
          the serial endosymbiosis theory [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] and with other
          findings [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] and therefore we designated this
          divergence as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BK</ENAMEX>-o (origin of eukaryotes). Estimation of
          the divergence time of the origin of plastids (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BK-p</ENAMEX>) was
          not a goal of this study, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LCA</ENAMEX> was not estimated
          because of an insufficient number of duplicate proteins
          needed for reciprocal rooting [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . Thus, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX>
          divergence times were studied: <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AK</ENAMEX>, BC, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BK</ENAMEX>-o, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BK-m</ENAMEX>, and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GK</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Eukaryotes</ENAMEX> derived from different prokaryotes are
          referred to herein as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          A (from <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AK</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          B-o (from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BK-o</ENAMEX>), and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B-m</ENAMEX> (from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BK-m</ENAMEX>).
          Because of the large amount of sequence conservation
          in these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, it was not possible to calibrate
          directly by extrapolation from vertebrates [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> ] , for
          which an extensive fossil record exists. For example,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sequences</ENAMEX> often were identical among <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rodents</ENAMEX>, primates,
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">birds</ENAMEX>. Instead, multiple calibrations were used from
          older divergences among kingdoms (<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX>, fungi)
          and animal phyla, derived from analysis of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">75</NUMEX> nuclear
          proteins calibrated with the vertebrate fossil record [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38</NUMEX> ] . This two-step calibration reduced the error
          involved in extrapolation. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> classes of time estimation
          methods were used and compared. The multigene (MG)
          approach uses the mean or mode of many single-gene time
          estimates [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40 41</NUMEX> ] whereas the average-distance (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AD</ENAMEX>)
          approach [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42 43 44</NUMEX> ] involves the combining of distances
          and rates among <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> to yield a single time
          estimate. For the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AD</ENAMEX> approach, we weight each single-gene
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">distance</ENAMEX>, before combining, by the length of the protein
          (aligned amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Protein</ENAMEX>-specific rates were estimated by regression,
          fixed through the origin, of these calibration points
          within eukaryotes: <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">arthropod-chordate</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.993</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ga</ENAMEX>),
          chordate-nematode (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.177</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ga</ENAMEX>), and plant-animal-fungi
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.576</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ga</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] . During the course of the study, it
          was discovered that the shape parameter (α) of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX>
          distribution used to account for rate variation among
          sites, estimated by a likelihood method [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX> ] , differed
          consistently between calibration taxa (average, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.99</NUMEX>) and
          the overall data set (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.44</NUMEX>) for each gene (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
          Therefore, a dual-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX> approach was taken whereby the
          eukaryote rate was estimated using the eukaryote <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">parameter</ENAMEX> and the time estimate (involving prokaryotes)
          was made using the overall <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma parameter</ENAMEX>. There is
          insufficient evidence at present to determine whether or
          not this difference is biologically based, related to the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">covarion</ENAMEX> model [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX> ] , or follows a simple scaling
          relationship with time or total <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> distance. If the
          relationship is scaled, additional modification in
          methods may be necessary in the future.
          We compared rates of change in archaebacterial versus
          eubacterial sequences using paralogous sequences (those
          related by gene duplication) as a root for relative rate
          tests [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47 48</NUMEX> ] . To examine rate differences between
          eukaryotic sequences and their closest prokaryote
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">orthologs</ENAMEX> (those representing the same gene), we used the
          more distant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">prokaryote</ENAMEX> (archaebacteria or eubacteria) as
          root. For examining rates in eukaryotic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sequences</ENAMEX> derived
          from either archaebacteria or eubacteria, we compared
          pairwise distances of the same taxa present in both
          locations (e.g., one <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> clustering with archaebacteria
          and the other with eubacteria) in the same <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. The
          discovery of rate differences among prokaryotes and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eukaryotes</ENAMEX> required rate adjustments for all <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and
          comparisons, including those accepted in rate tests.
          These adjustments were made by estimating time only with
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="GAME">eukaryote</ENAMEX> lineage, or in the case of BC, using a
          cyanobacterial rate adjusted by direct comparison of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cyanobacteria</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> and eukaryote <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">branch</ENAMEX> in rate tests.
          For example, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AK</ENAMEX> divergence time was estimated only
          with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          A calibration and the BC, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BK</ENAMEX>-o, and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BK</ENAMEX>-m divergence times were estimated only with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">K</ENAMEX> 
          B-o calibration. These restrictions
          further reduced the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> available for time
          estimation to the following: <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AK</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX> total, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX>
          constant-rate), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BK</ENAMEX>-o (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">25</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BK-m</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">7, 5</ENAMEX>), BC (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">20</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>),
          and 
          Giardia -eukaryotes (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">17</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX>).
          Modes were used in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MG</ENAMEX> approach, as described
          previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> ] , except with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BK</ENAMEX>-m comparison where
          the median was used because of the small number of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. The mode is preferred over the mean or median
          because it eliminates or reduces the effect of outliers
          (e.g., unusually high estimates resulting from paralogous
          comparisons). In this study, a large number of
          overlapping bins was used initially to better define the
          distribution of time estimates, followed by use of a
          smaller number of non-overlapping bins and standard
          estimation of mode by interpolation. This two-step
          procedure was found to reduce the influence of bin size
          on mode estimation. For the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AD</ENAMEX> approach, single-gene
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">distances</ENAMEX> and rates were weighted by sequence length and
          then combined distances were divided by combined
          rates.
        
        
          Phylogeny estimation
          Phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">49</TIMEX> ] were constructed for each
          gene from amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> data to assist in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene</ENAMEX> selection and
          interpretation. A <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gamma</ENAMEX> distance was used for all <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>,
          with α estimated from the entire data set [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX> ] . An
          analysis involving combined <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein alignments</ENAMEX> was
          performed with maximum likelihood [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> ] , neighbor
          joining [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">49 51</NUMEX> ] , and maximum parsimony [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">51</TIMEX> ] , using
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">bootstrapping</ENAMEX>. Bootstrap consensus trees show
          branch-lengths estimated by ordinary least-squares method
          [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">51</TIMEX> ] . Bootstrap support ≥ <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> was considered
          significant.
