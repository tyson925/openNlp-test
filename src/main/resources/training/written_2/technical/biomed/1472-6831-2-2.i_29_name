        Over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the last 50 years</TIMEX>, the widespread usage of
        fluoridated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> and fluoridated dentrifices have been
        cited as major reasons for a decline in caries since the
        early 1970s [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] , and for the appearance of a significant
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">association</ENAMEX> between oral hygiene and caries experience [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4</NUMEX> ] . An inverse relationship exists between salivary
        fluoride concentration and caries experience in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">deciduous</ENAMEX> and permanent dentition [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] , but fluoride
        concentration is excluded from most caries prediction
        models [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Acids</ENAMEX> in bacterial plaques cause caries in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">pits</ENAMEX>, fissures and interdental regions of teeth, but they
        also enhance the inhibitory effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fluoride</ENAMEX> on
        demineralization, confounding the ability to predict caries
        from the salivary <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fluoride</ENAMEX> concentration [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9</NUMEX> ] .
        The greater the consumption of dietary sucrose, the
        greater the fall in pH and fraction of acidogenic, acid
        tolerant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> in tooth adherent plaques [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 11</NUMEX> ] . The
        number of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> (mostly mutans streptococci and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">lactobacilli</ENAMEX>), and the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fluoride</ENAMEX> content, discriminate
        between severe and mild caries in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12-15 year-old</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Acid-tolerant bacteria</ENAMEX> require <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-alanyl glycerol
        lipoteichoic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-alanyl LTA) in their membranes and
        cell surfaces [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . D-alanyl <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTA</ENAMEX> is made by esterifying
        carboxyl-activated <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-alanine to glycerol in membrane <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTA</ENAMEX> by
        means of a <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">alanyl-carrier enzyme</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DCP</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . Strains of
        
        Streptococcus mutans in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DCP</ENAMEX> is
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">inactive</ENAMEX> do not initiate growth at below <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">pH 6.5</NUMEX> and make
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">glycerol LTA</ENAMEX> without <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-alanine [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . In the DCP active
        strains, soluble <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alanyl LTA</ENAMEX> is extruded into culture
        fluid 
        in vitro [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 17</NUMEX> ] or plaque 
        in vivo [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-alanyl esters
        are stable at pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.0</NUMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37Â°C</TIMEX>, but hydrolyze to free
        D-alanine and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTA</ENAMEX> with a half-life of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.9</NUMEX> h at pH 8.0 [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX>
        ] . Healthy gingival sulci have a pH of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.5</NUMEX> - <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.5</NUMEX> and
        inflamed sulci a pH of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.5</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.5</NUMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] .
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">About 30%</NUMEX> of young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> have serum <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IgG antibodies</ENAMEX> that
        precipitate with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-alanyl <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTA</ENAMEX>, but not with <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">alanine</NUMEX>-free
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTA</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 21</NUMEX> ] . It is likely that plaques induce these IgG
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> from gingival sulci that contain more
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid-tolerant bacteria</ENAMEX>. An elevated IgG <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> response
        to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-alanyl <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTA</ENAMEX> may therefore indicate the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> in whom
        an inhibitory effect of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fluoride</ENAMEX> on caries is enhanced. The
        fluoride concentrations of plaque and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">saliva</ENAMEX> are related to
        whether the drinking <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> is fluoridated [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] and to
        oral hygiene, which nearly always involves using a
        fluoridated dentrifice. The aim of this study was therefore
        to determine whether elevated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> responders to
        D-alanyl <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTA</ENAMEX> show a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMFT</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fluoride</ENAMEX>
        exposure and gingival health not apparent in low
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">responders</ENAMEX>.

          Subjects
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Antibody</ENAMEX> was obtained from <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>)

          treatment, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">145</NUMEX> volunteer blood <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donors</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">volunteers</ENAMEX>),
          and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">37</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">siblings</ENAMEX> aged <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5</TIMEX> through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> Amish
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>. The dental <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were attending
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center</ENAMEX> between
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1985 and 1988</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">volunteers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> members
          were attending <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">centers</ENAMEX> elsewhere in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> at the same
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX>. All subjects consented to provide <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX> for
          antibody analysis according to local <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institutional Review</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">Board</ENAMEX> procedures (see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acknowledgements</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">student</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX> and volunteer <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">397</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>) were
          used to determine what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">IgG</ENAMEX> concentration constituted an
          elevated antibody response to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-alanyl <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTA</ENAMEX>, to ensure
          that these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> were not unique to dental or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oklahoma</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> and to examine whether the antibody
          concentration was sex or age-associated. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amish</ENAMEX> family
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">siblings</ENAMEX> were selected to determine the frequency of high
          antibody concentration in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>. Each
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sibling</ENAMEX> had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">parent</ENAMEX> high responder to
          increase the likelihood of exposure to an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX>-associated oral microbiota from birth.
          The clinical study <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">participants</ENAMEX> consisted of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">87</NUMEX> dental
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">88.4%</NUMEX> male) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">64</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">31.3%</NUMEX> male) who
          were medically healthy. All had <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18</NUMEX> or more natural teeth
          and were aged <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">>22 and <</NUMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38 years</TIMEX>. Of these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">participants</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">67</NUMEX> dental <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> provided
          information that permitted an estimate of exposure to
          fluoridated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">residence</ENAMEX>(s) from birth through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 14</TIMEX>
          in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1980</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fluoridation Census</ENAMEX>. Subjects not using the
          public water supply, or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">resident</ENAMEX> outside of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> for
          more than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18 months</TIMEX>, were excluded. Exposure to water
          fluoridation scored <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> for each of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five 3-year</TIMEX> age
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">cohorts: 0-2, 3-5, 6-8</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">9-11</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12-14</NUMEX> to give a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fluoride</ENAMEX>
          exposure score (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F Score</ENAMEX>) of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0</NUMEX> (no <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">exposure</ENAMEX>) to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>
          (complete <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">exposure</ENAMEX>) described previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] .
          Most dental <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> had mild <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">caries</ENAMEX> and gingivitis
          and most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> had moderate to severe caries and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">gingivitis</ENAMEX>. Exceptionally healthy or exceptionally
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">diseased subjects</ENAMEX> were therefore increased compared to a
          similar number of subjects obtained as a random sample.
          This wide distribution of clinical measurements provided
          more stable estimates (narrower confidence intervals) of
          regression coefficients (Î²) than would be obtained from a
          similar number from a random survey of the general
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. Regression lines are more robust when a
          greater range of measurements is used [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] .
        
        
          Clinical measurements
          Dental caries experience was the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Decayed</ENAMEX>,
          Missing and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Filled Teeth</ENAMEX> (DMFT), excluding <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> molars
          and teeth reported missing for other reasons. Decayed
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">teeth</ENAMEX> (DT) were also enumerated separately from missing
          and filled teeth (MFT). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DT</ENAMEX> indicates a combination of
          delay in seeking therapy and faster development of new
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cavities</ENAMEX>. Fluoridated dentrifice use is related to oral
          hygiene but not toothbrushing frequency in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">aged</TIMEX> as
          in the present clinical study [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] and young enough to
          have likely used fluoridated dentrifices from early
          childhood. Sensitive staining for plaque accumulation [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> ] was therefore used with measures of gingivitis and
          pocket depth at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">mesio-buccal</ENAMEX>, buccal, disto-lingual
          and lingual surfaces of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> teeth employed for the
          simplified oral hygiene index [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] , substituting
          adjacent teeth as necessary (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> sampled).
          Gingivitis was determined by whether a site bled
          within <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">30 sec</NUMEX> of gentle probing, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BOP</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 27</NUMEX> ] and pocket
          depth by measuring the distance (mm) from the free
          gingival margin to the base of the sulcus or pocket.
          Finally, each subject was asked to suck an erythrosin
          tablet for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sec</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> examined for stained
          plaque [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] . For each subject, the mean prevalences of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">plaque</ENAMEX> (PL) and bleeding on probing (BOP), and the mean
          pocket depth (PD), were calculated across all sampled
          sites. The clinical measurements were made by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two</TIMEX>
          experienced <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clinicians</ENAMEX> who were calibrated for this
          study. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">clinicians</ENAMEX> agreed strongly with respect to all
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">measurements</ENAMEX> (correlation coefficients, r <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 0.85</NUMEX>; p
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.001</NUMEX>) except gingival bleeding index, for which a
          weaker correlation was noted (r = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.60</NUMEX>, p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.001</NUMEX>).
          The data reported are the mean measurements from the
          clinical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">examiners</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antigen</ENAMEX> purification
          D-alanyl <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTA</ENAMEX>, but not <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">alanine</NUMEX>-free <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTA</ENAMEX>, is present
          in culture filtrates of

          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Bacteria</ENAMEX> were grown at <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">37Â°C</NUMEX> in trypticase soy <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">broth</ENAMEX> to
          late stationary phase (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX> h), when the maximal amount of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">antigen</ENAMEX> is extruded into the culture fluid [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . After
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">centrifugation</ENAMEX> to remove the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX>, culture fluid (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) was concentrated <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20-fold</NUMEX> over a YM10 Diaflo Membrane
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">filter</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amicon Corp.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Beverley, MA</ENAMEX>). D-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alanyl LTA</ENAMEX> in the
          concentrate was detected by immunoelectrophoresis, using
          a standard human serum identified previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] .
          D-Alanine-free <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTA</ENAMEX> does not react with this serum <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IgG</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18 21</NUMEX> ] . The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-alanyl <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTA</ENAMEX> was purified by passing the
          concentrated culture fluid over a <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">90 Ã— 2.5 cm</NUMEX> Sephacryl
          column in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.4</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">M NaCl</ENAMEX> buffered with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">M</ENAMEX> sodium acetate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">pH 5</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Antigen</ENAMEX> in the fractions was collected. After
          equilibrating with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> mM sodium acetate buffer pH <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.0</NUMEX>, it
          bound to a short <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sephacryl S-200</ENAMEX> and eluted by adding <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mM NaCl</ENAMEX> as described previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] .

          System at room temperature [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] . Pegs protruding from
          a lid were placed over a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">96</NUMEX>-well plate or trough
          containing <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">14 ml of 10 Î</NUMEX>¼g/ml <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-alanyl <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTA</ENAMEX> in acetate

          incubation, excess <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IgG antibody</ENAMEX> from the serum was washed
          away by thrice transferring the pegs to troughs

          The concentration of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX>-specific <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IgG</ENAMEX> in standard

          alternatively divided into clusters, using the unweighted
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair group</ENAMEX> method with arithmetic averages [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NT-SYS</ENAMEX>, a package of multivariate statistical computer
          programs [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] . A low response supremum was obtained by
          taking the antilog of the mean <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IgG</ENAMEX> content of the
          non-precipitating sera plus <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> standard deviation, or
          the antilog of the highest <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IgG</ENAMEX> content of the cluster
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">grouping</ENAMEX> containing the least <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX>.
          The effect of age was determined after splitting the
          subjects into decile <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cohorts</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>) and comparing the
          fraction of high <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody responders</ENAMEX> in each cohort. The
          youngest cohort was composed of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amish</ENAMEX> family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">siblings</ENAMEX> who
          were younger than any dental <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">volunteers</ENAMEX>.
          A multiple linear regression procedure was utilized to
          examine the relationship of caries (DMFT) with age, F
          score, and measures of gingival health obtained in this
          study: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PL</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BOP</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PD</ENAMEX>. The regression on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMFT</ENAMEX> was used:
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) to estimate the partial regression coefficients (Î²
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coefficients</ENAMEX>) within the high and low antibody response
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) to test each Î² coefficient for significance
          after accounting for the effects of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">the other four</NUMEX>
          variables; and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) to examine for significant differences
          in Î² coefficients between the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> response <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. A
          Î² coefficient is interpreted as the change in disease
          response (DMFT) per unit change in one of the independent
          variables after adjusting for all the other independent
          variables in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX>. Within each antibody response
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple regression coefficient</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX> 2) provided
          an estimate of the proportion of variance in DMFT
          explained by the combination of variables tested.
          Stepwise regression then identified the best estimate of
          the variance in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMFT</ENAMEX> that was explained by multiple
          variables in the separate and combined high and low
          responder <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>. These multiple regression analyses were
          repeated using gingivitis (BOP) as the dependent variable
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">OHPI</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PD</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DT</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MFT</ENAMEX> and age as independent
          variables. All of the clinically examined <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> were
          included because F score was not an independent variable
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BOP</ENAMEX>.
          To ensure that obtained relationships were robust,
          influential points (outliers) were identified using a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">statistic</ENAMEX> (DFFITS) which measured the change in
          coefficients caused by removing the data for each
          subject. If this change exceeded <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2âˆš</NUMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">p/n</ENAMEX>), where p was the
          number of independent variables and n the number of
          samples [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] , the point was influential. Repeating the
          regressions with all the influential points removed
          determined the degree to which these points had affected
          the results.

          IgG <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> were initially detected in sera
          irrespective of whether <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-alanyl <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTA</ENAMEX> was
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">immunoprecipitated</ENAMEX>. Excluding the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amish</ENAMEX> family <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>,
          there were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">288</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> whose sera failed to
          immunoprecipitate <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antigen</ENAMEX> (detected by

          <<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 -6</NUMEX>). High responders therefore had a log antibody

          deviation of non-precipitating serum (log ng IgG /ml
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">>3.83</NUMEX>). However, low IgG concentrations formed a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cluster</ENAMEX> whose supremum (log ng <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IgG antibody</ENAMEX>/ml) was
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.861</NUMEX>, which corresponds to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.26</NUMEX> Î¼g/ml (left side of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Subjects</ENAMEX> were therefore classified as low responders
          if their log IgG <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> content exceeded <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.86</NUMEX> rather
          than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.83</NUMEX>. The odds ratio for a serum from a high
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody responder</ENAMEX> immunoprecipitating <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-alanyl <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTA</ENAMEX> was

          in different age <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cohorts</ENAMEX>. There was a high responder
          frequency of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35-40%</NUMEX> from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 15 through 54</TIMEX>. The reduced
          frequencies of high response in childhood and old age
          were not significant. However, within the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amish</ENAMEX> family
          offspring high IgG responders were significantly older.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2shows</ENAMEX> that the high responder <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">offspring</ENAMEX> had a mean

          who were high responders (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX>) compared with the general

          High antibody responders accounted for a similar
          fraction of subjects irrespective of whether they were in
          the clinical study, or dental <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX>, or patients
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Men</ENAMEX> were <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">49.1%</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">395</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">students</ENAMEX> patients

          as originally estimated (squared correlation coefficient,

          whereas those from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BOP</ENAMEX> and F score were only significant
          in high responders and those from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PD</ENAMEX> were only
          significant in low responders. Comparison of the
          differences in Î² coefficients between high and low
          responders, column 4 (column <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2 - column 3</ENAMEX>), indicated
          relationships of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMFT</ENAMEX> to pocket depth that were

          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>, column <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stepwise</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regression</ENAMEX> confirmed the similar associations

          respectively, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PD</ENAMEX> was not significant, being entirely

          (from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35 or 67</TIMEX>) the strength of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> was similar

          Because caries experience associated with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fluoride</ENAMEX> and
          gingival health in high responders, poor gingival health
          should increase the number of decayed teeth (DT) more
          than in low responders. When <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BOP</ENAMEX> was regressed against

          significantly between the high and low responders.
          Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DT</ENAMEX> alone significantly correlated with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BOP</ENAMEX> in
          both response <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.01</NUMEX>), it associated with

          Influential points (outliers), whose presence might

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">responders</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> high responders. When these subjects
          were omitted, the respective regression coefficients or
          their significance were little changed, indicating that
          the different, partial, linear regression coefficients in
          high or low responders were not artifacts of influential
          or outlying points.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        This study has demonstrated that IgG <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibodies</ENAMEX> to
        D-alanyl LTA are widespread in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX>. The fraction of
        high responders was essentially constant from early
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">adulthood</ENAMEX> through middle age, but reduced in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX>
        (<<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15 years</TIMEX>) and old age (><TIMEX TYPE="DATE">55 years</TIMEX>). Within the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">adults</ENAMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ages 15-55 years</TIMEX>) a change from low to high
        response or 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">vice</ENAMEX> versa was found unlikely from
        repeated measurements over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2-6 months</TIMEX>. A similar lack of
        change in this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">IgG antibody</ENAMEX> concentration was reported <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>-3
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">months</TIMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">an additional 26</TIMEX> similarly aged <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> had
        received oral hygiene therapy in another study [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] .
        Finally, the family studies established that a high
        antibody response was probably induced during the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mid</ENAMEX>-teenage <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>. In order to apply the results of this
        study to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> and young <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">teenagers</ENAMEX>, longitudinal studies
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> response in relation to age and the
        clinical measurements in this study may need to be
        undertaken.
        Despite few investigations of caries risk in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22-38 year</TIMEX>
        old <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> compared with a younger or older group [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] ,
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">association</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMFT</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PL</ENAMEX> in this study agrees with
        that obtained from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35 year</TIMEX> old <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Norwegians</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . Plaque
        (simplified oral hygiene index measurement) accounted for
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15%</NUMEX> of the variance in number of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">decayed</ENAMEX>/filled teeth
        surfaces in that study, and for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">19%</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMFT</ENAMEX> variance
        within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">all 151</TIMEX> clinically examined <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> in this study
        (ignoring age, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody</ENAMEX> and all other variables). Other
        studies have shown that the amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fluoride</ENAMEX> applied from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dentrifices</ENAMEX> is measured better from oral hygiene or plaque
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">accumulation</ENAMEX>, as in this study, and not from the reported
        frequency of dentrifice use [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3</NUMEX> ] . Finally, because
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> aged <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">more than 38</TIMEX> are unlikely to have used
        fluoridated toothpastes until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later</TIMEX> in life, they were
        omitted to avoid confounding the results.
        The rationale behind this study was that acidic plaque
        environments increase the amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-alanyl <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTA</ENAMEX> and
        promote its immunogenicity. Accordingly, caries-protection
        by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fluoride</ENAMEX> in the water supply and dentrifices was strong
        in high IgG <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody responders</ENAMEX>, accounting for just over
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> of the variance in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMFT</ENAMEX>. In addition, gingivitis (BOP
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">prevalence</ENAMEX>) associated strongly and significantly with the
        number of decayed (untreated) teeth, suggesting that
        preventing gingivitis increased <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fluoride</ENAMEX> exposure from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dentrifices</ENAMEX> and reduced the number of decayed teeth.
        Increased exposure to fluoridated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>, and dentrifices
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with good gingival health, may result in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fluoride inhibiting</ENAMEX> enamel remineralization at the acidic
        plaque pH likely present in high responders.
        In low responders, the fewer antibodies to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-alanyl LTA
        suggest less colonization by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid-tolerant bacteria</ENAMEX> and a
        weaker cariogenic attack. DMFT associated with age, as
        reported for other subjects whose sera did not precipitate
        D-alanyl <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTA</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] , and also with pocket depth. An
        increase in pocket depth is caused by periodontopathic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> that associate with an alkaline environment in the
        sulci over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">many years</TIMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] and a microbiota that is
        neither acidic nor <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid-tolerant</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . The coefficient
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DMFT</ENAMEX> association with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PD</ENAMEX> in low responders therefore
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">differed</ENAMEX> significantly from high responders within whom F
        score and gingival health were stronger covariates.
      
      
        Conclusions
        An increased mutans streptococcal challenge accompanying
        low plaque pH (high antibody response to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-alanyl LTA)
        allows much of the variation in caries experience to be
        controlled by water fluoridation and by the use of
        fluoridated dentrifices associated with maintaining oral
        health. High IgG <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">antibody responders</ENAMEX> are therefore better
        protected from caries in an optimally fluoridated
        environment. The concept that <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fluoride</ENAMEX> protects better from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">caries</ENAMEX> in a low pH environment [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] was recently used to
        explain why there is a poor association between caries
        experience and pH fall after a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> sucrose rinse [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] .
        In low responders, increased <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fluoride</ENAMEX> exposure from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">dentriflce</ENAMEX> use to maintain oral health, or from water
        fluoridation, associate relatively poorly with caries
        experience. Although this study has indicated that the IgG
        antibodies to <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-alanyl <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTA</ENAMEX> do not become elevated until
        after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 17</TIMEX>, when much caries may have already developed,
        they may be elevated to a lower level in <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> who
        eventually become high responders. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-alanyl LTA
        antibody response is not detectable in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">saliva</ENAMEX> (unpublished
        studies), but it can be measured from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only a thumb-prick</NUMEX> of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">blood</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Longitudinal</ENAMEX> studies of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX>-alanyl <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTA</ENAMEX> response in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">children</ENAMEX> could improve current efforts to predict caries
        susceptibility by relating it to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fluoride</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fluoride</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ion</ENAMEX> product for fluoroapatite in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">saliva</ENAMEX> and the pH change
        after a sucrose rinse [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5 12 13 33</ENAMEX> ] .
