        The lower urinary tract serves to store and periodically
        eliminate urine. The activity of the urinary bladder and
        the external urethral sphincter must be properly
        coordinated in order for continence to be maintained and
        timely micturition to occur. Effective micturition requires
        the coordination of central and peripheral nervous system
        structures that activate sympathetic, parasympathetic and
        somatic motor pathways innervating the bladder and the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">urethra</ENAMEX> (for a recent review see [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] ).
        Pathophysiological conditions and pharmacological
        manipulations that affect central and/or peripheral nervous
        system <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> involved in micturition may alter the
        function of these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> organs [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX> ] .
        Atypical antipsychotic (neuroleptic) <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agents</ENAMEX> are favored
        over traditional antipsychotic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">medication</ENAMEX> (e.g.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">haloperidol</ENAMEX>) because of their lower incidence of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">extrapyramidal</ENAMEX> side effects, their greater efficacy in
        improving negative symptoms of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">schizophrenia</ENAMEX>, and their
        effectiveness in treating schizophrenic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> not
        responding to conventional neuroleptics [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] . However,
        side effects continue to pose a challenge to effective
        treatment [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . These novel neuroleptics display a
        complex pharmacological profile with affinities for several
        receptor systems but are generally characterized by a
        greater affinity for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT2A <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> than for the
        target of the traditional neuroleptics, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">D2 receptor</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> ] .
        We have shown recently that the atypical antipsychotic
        clozapine, and to a lesser extent haloperidol, markedly
        influenced several micturition parameters in anesthetized
        rats [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Clozapine</ENAMEX> decreased the micturition volume
        while increasing bladder capacity, thus increasing residual
        volume [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . Moreover, clozapine profoundly depressed the
        activity of the external urethral sphincter (EUS).
        Clozapine abolished the electromyogram (EMG) recorded from
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EUS</ENAMEX> during the rising phase of a bladder contraction
        before urine is voided (similar to the "guarding reflex" [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9</NUMEX> ] ). In addition, clozapine also abolished the high
        frequency oscillations in the bladder pressure and
        accompanying bursts in the external urethral sphincter <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EMG</ENAMEX>,
        that are present during the expulsion phase of the
        micturition profile of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . In the clinical
        literature, clozapine therapy is associated with a high
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">incidence</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">up to 44%</NUMEX> in a recent study [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] ) of urinary
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">incontinence</ENAMEX> and enuresis.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Olanzapine</ENAMEX> is a newer atypical antipsychotic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">agent</ENAMEX> with
        a pharmacological profile very similar to that of clozapine
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] . In human brain tissue, olanzapine displays very
        high affinity for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the H1</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">histamine</ENAMEX> receptor, high affinity
        for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT2A and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5-HT2C</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . In addition it
        also shows affinity for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D2</TIMEX>, muscarinic, and alpha1
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">receptors</ENAMEX>, with lower affinity for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">alpha2</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT1<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">D</ENAMEX> and
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT1A <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] ).
        Olanzapine therapy is associated with a number of side
        effects, including somnolence, agitation, nervousness,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">headaches</ENAMEX>, dizziness, weight gain, constipation and dry
        mouth [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . Olanzapine, however, does not produce
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">extrapyramidal</ENAMEX> side effects, postural hypotension or
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hemotoxicity</ENAMEX> (a particular problem for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> on
        clozapine therapy [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] ). Although urinary retention as a
        result of olanzapine therapy may be predicted from binding
        studies due to olanzapine's antimuscarinic activity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ]
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 1</NUMEX> case report of micturition disturbance associated
        with olanzapine has recently appeared [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . On the other
        hand, several reports of urinary disturbances due to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clozapine</ENAMEX> can be found in the clinical literature [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 10 15</NUMEX>
        ] .
        Risperidone, another novel atypical neuroleptic, shows
        very high affinity for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5HT-2A</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> with lower affinity
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">D2 receptors</ENAMEX>. In terms of profile risperidone binds
        5HT2A>><TIMEX TYPE="DATE">alpha1</TIMEX>=<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">H1>D2>alpha2</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 16</NUMEX> ]
        ). Risperidone displays little or no affinity for the
        muscarinic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12 16</NUMEX> ] and yet risperidone
        therapy has been associated with urinary incontinence (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">28%</NUMEX>
        in some cases [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 18 19</NUMEX> ] ).
        We undertook this study to examine the effects of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">olanzapine</ENAMEX> and risperidone on the cystometrogram of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">anesthetized rats</ENAMEX>. These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> novel atypical neuroleptic
        compounds are used in clinical practice and it might be
        important to identify possible side effects that may have
        an impact on compliance to therapy or adversely affect the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>'s quality of life (e.g. persistent urinary
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">incontinence</ENAMEX>). Based on our previous findings with
        clozapine, and given the similarity in pharmacological
        profiles between olanzapine and clozapine, we hypothesized
        that olanzapine might also result in changes in urodynamic
        variables and/or external urethral sphincter <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EMG</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Risperidone</ENAMEX> provides an interesting comparison to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">olanzapine</ENAMEX> since it has a similar pharmacological profile
        to olanzapine but without the antimuscarinic activity. In
        this study olanzapine had greater effects than risperidone
        but both decreased micturition volume and increased
        residual volume in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">anesthetized rats</ENAMEX>. In addition, they
        inhibited the activity of the external urethral sphincter.
        Olanzapine, but not risperidone, also had peripheral
        effects that reduced bladder contraction amplitude to
        electrical stimulation of the pelvic nerve.

          Effects of olanzapine and risperidone on single
          cystometry parameters (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tables 2and 3</ENAMEX>)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Olanzapine</ENAMEX> had no effect on bladder capacity (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 3A</ENAMEX>)
          and risperidone increased BC only at the highest dose (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">mg/kg; Fig 2I</ENAMEX>,<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">J; 3A</ENAMEX>) when the bladder capacity was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.54</NUMEX>

          for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicle</ENAMEX>-injected control.
          Micturition volume, however, was decreased by both
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">olanzapine</ENAMEX> and risperidone. The mean micturition volume
          in the olanzapine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> after administration of vehicle
          was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.2 ml (±0.0.37</NUMEX>). However, after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.0</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX>
          the micturition volume dropped to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.08 ml (±0.014</NUMEX>) and
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.04 ml (±0.006</NUMEX>), respectively (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3B; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>).
          Similarly, the risperidone <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> had a mean micturition
          volume of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.27 ml (±0.072</NUMEX>) after vehicle injection, but
          there was a significant decrease to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.1 ml (±0.019</NUMEX>) and
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.12 ml (±0.016</NUMEX>) after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.0</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX> of risperidone
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3B; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>). At <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX> of risperidone, the
          micturition volume was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.19 ml (± 0.036</NUMEX>) which was not
          statistically different from the control values.
          Consequently, the residual volume showed significant
          increases after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/kg doses of olanzapine (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">76</NUMEX> ±
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.3 and 89 ± 2.4%</NUMEX>, respectively; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 3C</ENAMEX>) and after all
          doses of risperidone (maximal effect at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX> ±
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.8%</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3C).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Olanzapine</ENAMEX> had no effect on pressure threshold;
          however, risperidone at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 and 10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX> resulted in a
          significant increase in the pressure threshold (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">5.0</NUMEX> ±
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1.02 and 5.8 ± 1.02 mm</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Hg</ENAMEX>, respectively; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4A)
          compared to the value observed during <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> of
          vehicle (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.4 ± 0.62</NUMEX> mm <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hg</ENAMEX>). The peak pressure during
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">contraction</ENAMEX> was not changed by any of the doses of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">olanzapine</ENAMEX> tested in this study (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 4B). Interestingly,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX> of risperidone showed a modest, but
          statistically significant increase in peak contraction
          pressure (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">13.7 ± 1.34</NUMEX> mm <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hg</ENAMEX> compared to control value of
          <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">11.5 ± 0.95 mm</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Hg; Fig</ENAMEX>. 4B).
          The contraction time was not affected by either
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">olanzapine</ENAMEX> or risperidone (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5A) but the expulsion
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> (the time during which the HFO occur) was
          significantly decreased by both (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>.
          5B). <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">Olanzapine</ENAMEX> decreased the expulsion time from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.6</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">(±0.55</NUMEX>) sec after vehicle injection to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.9 (±0.38</NUMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sec</ENAMEX> after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.0</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX>, respectively (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 5B). The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">risperidone</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> had an expulsion time of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">3.6 (±0.83</NUMEX>)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sec</ENAMEX> after control and it decreased to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.5 (±0.34</NUMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.4</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">(±0.35</NUMEX>) sec after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX> of risperidone (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fig</ENAMEX>
          5B). At <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX> of risperidone, the expulsion time was
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.2 (± 0.46</NUMEX>) sec.
          Similarly, olanzapine significantly decreased the
          amplitude of high frequency oscillations (HFO) from a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> value of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.6 (±0.19</NUMEX>) to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.0 (±0.38</NUMEX>) mm <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hg</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">mg/kg</ENAMEX> and abolished the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HFO</ENAMEX> in all <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> tested at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">mg/kg</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5C</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Risperidone</ENAMEX> also reduced the
          amplitude of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HFO</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.6 (±0.19</NUMEX>) to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.0 (±0.22</NUMEX>), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.9</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">(±0.18</NUMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.1 (± 0.22</NUMEX>) mm <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hg</ENAMEX> after <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 and 10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX>
          of risperidone (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5C</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          Effects of olanzapine and risperidone on the
          external urethral sphincter (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Tables 2and 3</ENAMEX>)
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EMG</ENAMEX> recorded from the urethral sphincter during
          bladder contractions also showed changes after
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">risperidone</ENAMEX> or olanzapine. Phase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EMG</ENAMEX>, occurring
          during the initial rise in bladder pressure during a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">contraction</ENAMEX>, was significantly decreased by olanzapine at
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">76 (±1.9</NUMEX>) and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">47 (±6.0</NUMEX>) percent of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> value (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 1F;<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1H</TIMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">6A</ENAMEX>). However, risperidone had
          no significant effect on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EMG</ENAMEX> during phase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fig</ENAMEX>
          6A).
          Phase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, which corresponds to the occurrence of high
          frequency oscillations, showed significant decreases in
          the integrated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EMG</ENAMEX> following olanzapine or risperidone
          administration. <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.1 mg/kg</NUMEX> of olanzapine significantly
          decreased the overall EMG during this phase to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">(±11.4</NUMEX>)<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">%</NUMEX> of the control value, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.0</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX> of
          olanzapine abolished the bursting pattern of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EMG</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fig</ENAMEX>
          1G;<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1H; Fig 6B</ENAMEX>). While risperidone also decreased the
          Phase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EMG</ENAMEX>, the maximal decrease was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">47 (±12.7</NUMEX>)<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">%</NUMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.0</NUMEX>
          mg/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX> when compared to control (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 6B</ENAMEX>) and the bursting
          pattern was not abolished. At <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX> of risperidone,
          the phase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EMG</ENAMEX> was <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">71 (± 22</NUMEX>) <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">%</NUMEX> and was not significantly
          different from <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicle</ENAMEX>.
          Phase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EMG</ENAMEX> during a bladder contraction also
          showed significant changes following olanzapine or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">risperidone</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 6C</ENAMEX>). Both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> significantly decreased
          the amount of integrated EMG but <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX> olanzapine had
          a more profound effect (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 6C</ENAMEX>), reducing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EMG</ENAMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">(±5.2</NUMEX>) <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">%</NUMEX> of the control value at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.0</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX> compared to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">68</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">(±8.0</NUMEX>) <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">%</NUMEX> of control after a similar dose of risperidone.

          vehicle.
          Finally, while risperidone had no effect on the
          amplitude of the EMG bursts occurring the expulsion phase
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 1; Fig 6D</ENAMEX>), olanzapine abolished bursting of the EMG
          at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.0</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX> in all <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> tested (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Fig 1H; 6D</ENAMEX>).

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Risperidone</ENAMEX> produced significant effects at all the doses
          tested, with a maximum drop in MAP of approximately <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46</NUMEX> mm
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hg</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 mg/kg</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Mean</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44</NUMEX> mm <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hg; SEM</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">±1.37</NUMEX>). Olanzapine
          showed a significant decrease in MAP at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.0</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX> with a

          at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX>, there was no further reduction in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">MAP</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Mean</ENAMEX>
          = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">57 ± 4.95</NUMEX> mm <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hg</ENAMEX>), however, significant respiratory
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">depression</ENAMEX> was observed and therefore we excluded this
          dose for the remaining <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> receiving olanzapine.
        
        
          Effects of olanzapine and risperidone on bladder

          Prolonged electrical stimulation of the pelvic nerve

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">components</ENAMEX>. An initial rise in bladder pressure (Phase I;
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 8A) that is resistant to muscarinic blockade and a

          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21</NUMEX> ] . Olanzapine at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 and 10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX> reduced the
          amplitude of Phase I to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">79 and 74%</NUMEX> of the control values,
          respectively (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 8A<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">;B</ENAMEX>). Risperidone, on the other hand,

        Discussion
        
          Effects of olanzapine and risperidone on urodynamic
          parameters and the external sphincter EMG
          Both olanzapine and risperidone are compounds with
          relatively high oral bioavailability. Clinically
          effective doses of olanzapine (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10-15</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18.4</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30.6</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">ng/ml</ENAMEX> plasma concentration [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 23 24</NUMEX> ] ) or risperidone
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3-6 mg/</ENAMEX><TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30.8</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ng</ENAMEX>/ml combined plasma concentration
          of risperidone and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX>-hydroxy-risperidone [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] )
          correspond well with the dose of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.0</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX> (equivalent to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">12.5 ng/ml</ENAMEX>) in the present study.
          Both neuroleptics markedly decreased the micturition
          volume, expulsion time, and amplitude of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HFO</ENAMEX> while
          residual volume increased. Most of the effects of either
          neuroleptic occurred at doses of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.1 and 1.0 mg/kg</NUMEX>.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Olanzapine</ENAMEX> appeared to have a greater maximal effect than
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">risperidone</ENAMEX>. At the highest dose of risperidone (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">mg/kg</ENAMEX>) there was less of an effect for the urodynamic
          parameters mentioned above. This is an interesting
          observation that was not explored further in the present
          study. The physiological significance is unclear since
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX> dose is well above the clinically effective
          doses of risperidone.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Olanzapine</ENAMEX> did not have an effect on bladder capacity
          or pressure threshold while risperidone increased both
          although only at the highest doses. Clozapine, on the
          other hand, was observed previously to increase bladder
          capacity and pressure threshold [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7</NUMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Olanzapine</ENAMEX> had
          no effect on bladder peak pressure during contraction and
          only the highest dose of risperidone showed an increase
          in pressure (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">119%</NUMEX> of control). The increase in pressure
          after the highest dose of risperidone was interesting and
          was also observed following electrical stimulation of the
          pelvic nerve suggesting a possible peripheral
          mechanism.
          Olanzapine, but not risperidone, decreased the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">integrated EMG</ENAMEX> recorded during the beginning of a bladder
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">contraction</ENAMEX> (Phase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>; comparable to the guarding reflex).
          Both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">neuroleptics</ENAMEX> decreased the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EMG</ENAMEX> during phase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, where
          high frequency oscillations occur in the bladder pressure
          along with bursting in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EUS</ENAMEX>, with the highest dose of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">olanzapine</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.0</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX>) abolishing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HFO</ENAMEX> and the
          bursting pattern. The integrated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EMG</ENAMEX> recorded during the
          end of the bladder contraction (Phase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>) was also
          decreased by both neuroleptics, with olanzapine reducing
          it to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">69% and 35%</NUMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.0</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX>, respectively,
          whereas the maximal effect for risperidone was observed
          at <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 mg/kg</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">68%</NUMEX>).
          Finally, neither <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">neuroleptic</ENAMEX> decreased the amplitude
          of the individual bursts of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EMG</ENAMEX> recorded during phase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>,
          except for the largest dose of olanzapine (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1 mg/kg</ENAMEX>) that
          abolished the bursting pattern.
          Therefore, as was the case for urodynamic parameters,
          although both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">neuroleptics</ENAMEX> decreased the activity of the
          external urethral sphincter (as reflected in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">integrated EMG</ENAMEX>), it appears that the effects of
          olanzapine were greater than those of risperidone. As was
          the case for some urodynamic parameters, the highest dose
          of risperidone showed a parabolic effect for some of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EMG</ENAMEX> parameters.
          Blockade of the external urethral sphincter in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">anesthetized rats</ENAMEX> results in a disappearance of the HFO
          from the bladder pressure recording as well as a
          disappearance of the bursting pattern of the EUS EMG
          observed during <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HFO</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 27 28</NUMEX> ] . In addition, there is
          a decreased ability of the bladder to empty as evidenced
          by a decreased micturition volume and an increased
          residual volume [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26 27 29</NUMEX> ] . Therefore, inhibition of
          the external urethral sphincter, as was the case for the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> neuroleptics in the present study and also for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clozapine</ENAMEX> in our <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> study [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] , might provide an
          important mechanism by which the bladder is rendered less
          effective in emptying and therefore altering other
          urodynamic variables resulting in decreased micturition
          volume and increased residual volume in rats.
        
        
          Possible neuropharmacological mechanisms for the
          effect of olanzapine and risperidone on the lower urinary
          tract
          We tested for peripheral antimuscarinic actions of
          both neuroleptics by examining their effects on bladder
          contractions elicited by electrical stimulation of the
          pelvic nerve. In this preparation, olanzapine but not
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">risperidone</ENAMEX> reduced the initial contraction amplitude
          (Phase I) somewhat and markedly depressed the prolonged
          contraction phase (<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Phase II; Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>) that is thought to
          be mediated by muscarinic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21</NUMEX> ] . During
          cystometry, however, neither olanzapine nor risperidone
          affected the peak pressure during bladder contraction.
          Therefore, although <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">olanzapine</ENAMEX> had a peripheral effect on
          bladder contraction amplitude, as might be expected from
          its antimuscarinic effects, this effect is not reflected
          in the peak contraction pressures observed during
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cystometry</ENAMEX>. This discrepancy is probably due to the fact
          that during a bladder contraction against a closed outlet
          (electrical stimulation of the pelvic nerve) higher
          pressures were developed than were observed during
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cystometry</ENAMEX> when the outlet was not obstructed. Since the
          clinically effective dose of olanzapine (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10-15</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day</TIMEX>;
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18.4</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30.6</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ng</ENAMEX>/ml plasma concentration [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 23 24</NUMEX> ] ) is
          greater than the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> dose observed to produce
          significant peripheral antimuscarinic effects in this
          study (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.0</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX>; equivalent to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12.5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ng</ENAMEX>/ml plasma
          concentration) a possible peripheral anti-muscarinic on
          the bladder during olanzapine therapy remains a
          concern.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Muscarinic</ENAMEX> blockade with <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">atropine</ENAMEX> decreased
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">micturition</ENAMEX> pressure and micturition volume, while
          increasing residual volume [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] and bladder capacity [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">31</NUMEX> ] . Similarly, central <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> of atropine
          decreased peak pressure and voiding efficiency while
          increasing bladder capacity in awake rats [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] . Thus
          it is possible that central and/or peripheral muscarinic
          blockade by olanzapine may have contributed to some of
          the changes observed in these parameters in the present
          study.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Muscarinic</ENAMEX> blockade was also reported to decrease the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EUS EMG</ENAMEX> in all phases of the bladder contraction [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] .
          However, another study showed no effect on the EUS EMG
          following muscarinic antagonism [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34</TIMEX> ] . Therefore, the
          exact role of muscarinic blockade on the activity of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EUS</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">rat</ENAMEX> is unclear.
          It is tempting to propose that the greater effect of
          olanzapine on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EUS</ENAMEX> may be due to its antimuscarinic
          activity, which risperidone does not have. In fact,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clozapine</ENAMEX> has a greater affinity for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">muscarinic receptors</ENAMEX>
          than olanzapine [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] and clozapine was also able to
          decrease the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EMG</ENAMEX> and abolish the bursting pattern during
          phase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>.
          Whether muscarinic blockade affects the activity of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EUS</ENAMEX> by acting on central or peripheral <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> remains
          to be determined. A direct inhibitory action of
          olanzapine on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">EUS</ENAMEX> muscle itself is not expected and
          was not seen with clozapine [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . However,
          antimuscarinic effects alone cannot account for all of
          the effects of olanzapine on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EUS</ENAMEX>, since risperidone
          had a similar effect although not quite as pronounced and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">risperidone</ENAMEX> has little or no affinity for muscarinic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] . Therefore, antagonism of other
          transmitter systems, e.g. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">D2</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">alpha1</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5-HT2</TIMEX>, remains as
          an explanation of the effects of these neuroleptics on
          urodynamic variables [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] .
          Selective antagonism of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">D2 receptors</ENAMEX> only modestly
          reduced the amplitude of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HFO</ENAMEX> without affecting any other
          urodynamic parameters [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6 35</ENAMEX> ] . Therefore, it is
          possible that olanzapine and risperidone decrease the
          amplitude of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HFO</ENAMEX>, at least partly, through antagonism
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">D2 receptors</ENAMEX>.
          In <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">anesthetized rats</ENAMEX>, doxazosin (alpha <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> adrenergic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor antagonist</ENAMEX>) administered systemically, increased
          micturition volume, bladder capacity, residual volume and
          micturition frequency while decreasing peak pressure [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">36</NUMEX>
          ] . Only an increase in the micturition frequency was
          observed after spinal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">doxazosin</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ]
          . Both olanzapine and risperidone have moderate affinity
          for the alpha <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> adrenergic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>), therefore
          it is possible that some of the effects observed in the
          present study were due to central and/or peripheral
          antagonism of alpha <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> adrenergic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> by these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX>. The decreases observed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">MAP</ENAMEX> suggest a possible
          peripheral alpha1 effect. However, we did not observe a
          decrease in the peak pressure as would have been
          predicted from previous studies using selective alpha 1
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">antagonism</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] . In addition, bladder capacity was not
          affected except at the highest dose of risperidone
          tested. Urinary incontinence as a result of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">olanzapine</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> ] or clozapine [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] therapy was treated effectively
          with ephedrine (alpha <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">adrenergic receptor agonist</ENAMEX>),
          suggesting a possible alpha1 effect. However,
          alpha1a-adrenoceptor gene polymorphism was found to play
          no role in clozapine-induced urinary incontinence [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ]
          .
          In terms of the effects on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EUS</ENAMEX>, alpha 1
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX> have been shown to inhibit the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EUS</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX>
          [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39 40 41</NUMEX> ] but not in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">anesthetized rat</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42</TIMEX> ] .
          Finally, both olanzapine and risperidone posses
          affinities to several <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">serotonin receptor subtypes</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). In <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cats</ENAMEX>, serotonin <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">antagonists</ENAMEX> caused a decrease in
          bladder capacity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX> ] however in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">anesthetized rats</ENAMEX>,
          serotonin antagonism did not have an effect on
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">micturition</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> ] . Recently, a selective <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT1A
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor antagonist</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">WAY-100635</ENAMEX>) was reported to inhibit
          bladder contractions in rats [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX> ] yet another report
          only observed an increase in the pressure threshold [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46</NUMEX>
          ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Olanzapine</ENAMEX> and risperidone have only low to modest
          affinity for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT1A <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptor</ENAMEX>, and higher affinities
          for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-HT2A and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5-HT2C</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12</NUMEX> ] . Serotonin
          5-HT2 and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">5-HT3 receptors facilitate pudendal reflexes</ENAMEX> in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">cat</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">47 48</NUMEX> ] , therefore it is possible that
          antagonism of these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> may block the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EUS</ENAMEX> in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">anesthetized rat</ENAMEX>. Given the modest role of serotonin
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">receptors</ENAMEX> in micturition in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">anesthetized rats</ENAMEX>, it remains
          to be determined whether the effects observed here were
          due to anti-serotonergic effects of these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">neuroleptics</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Clinical implications
          While there are several reports of urinary
          disturbances following clozapine therapy [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3 10 15</ENAMEX> ] ,
          there are relatively few reports of urinary incontinence
          with risperidone or olanzapine. In one report,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">twenty-eight</NUMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">28%</NUMEX>) of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> on risperidone developed
          at least transient urinary incontinence, compared to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13%</NUMEX>
          before starting treatment [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> ] . Other reports also
          suggest urinary incontinence associated with risperidone
          therapy [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17 19</NUMEX> ] .
          To date, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> case report of urinary incontinence
          with olanzapine therapy that resolved with ephredrine was
          found in the literature [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] . In the present study,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">olanzapine</ENAMEX> had more profound effects on urodynamic
          parameters and the EUS than risperidone and therefore the
          incidence of urinary disturbances in clinical practice
          would be predicted to be higher. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Olanzapine</ENAMEX> is a newer
          compound than clozapine or risperidone and therefore, a
          larger incidence of urinary symptoms with olanzapine
          therapy may await a larger sampling.
          Finally, possible side effects of neuroleptics, such
          as urinary retention, may be predicted from binding
          studies using human brain tissue [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] if antimuscarinic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">affinities</ENAMEX> will correspond to antimuscarinic effects on
          the bladder. However, olanzapine and risperidone may also
          result in urinary disturbances by their influence on
          central pathways mediating bladder contractions or
          coordinating external urethral sphincter, as may have
          been the case in the present study. Such effects may not
          be readily apparent or predictable from receptor binding
          studies.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Olanzapine</ENAMEX> and to a lesser extent risperidone, altered
        several micturition parameters and they inhibited the
        external urethral sphincter in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">anesthetized rat</ENAMEX>. These
        effects resulted in a decreased effectiveness of the
        bladder to empty as evidenced by a decreased micturition
        volume and an increase in the residual volume, and a
        decreased activity of the external urethral sphincter.
        Although olanzapine also showed peripheral anti-muscarinic
        effects on bladder contractions, risperidone did not.
        Therefore, peripheral anti-muscarinic effects alone cannot
        explain all the changes observed with these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> and they
        might reflect central effects on micturition pathways.
      
      
        Materials and Methods
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Urodynamic Studies</ENAMEX>
          The bladder was emptied and allowed to equilibrate to
          air pressure for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">5 minutes</TIMEX> before beginning each
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cystometrogram</ENAMEX>. Room temperature saline was infused into
          the bladder (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.11</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ml</ENAMEX>/<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">min</ENAMEX>) while recording bladder
          pressure and the infusion was stopped when a contraction
          occurred. Volume expelled was determined by placing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cotton</ENAMEX> gauze at the urinary meatus and weighing before
          and after micturition. External urethral sphincter EMG
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EUS-EMG</ENAMEX>) was recorded throughout the cystometrogram and
          for sometime after the filling had stopped. Cumulative
          doses of olanzapine (provided as a courtesy by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ely Lilly</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indianapolis</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicle</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.01</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX>; n = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>) and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">risperidone</ENAMEX> (RBI; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">vehicle</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.01</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">mg</ENAMEX>/<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">kg</NUMEX>; n = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7</NUMEX>)
          were administered <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.</ENAMEX>v. at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">approximately 10 minute</TIMEX>
          intervals. The plasma half-life of olanzapine and
          risperidone are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> hr, respectively [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25 49</NUMEX> ] .
          Both <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> were dissolved in a minimal amount of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HCl</ENAMEX>, and brought up to volume with saline (final pH = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>).
          Cystometrograms were started <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">approximately 3 minutes</TIMEX>
          after each drug <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">administration</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Bladder contractions induced by pelvic nerve
          stimulation
          In order to determine the direct peripheral effects of
          these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drugs</ENAMEX> on the bladder, the distal end of a pelvic
          nerve was stimulated electrically to elicit a bladder
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">contraction</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX>). Both hypogastric and pelvic nerves
          were cut before they entered the major pelvic ganglion
          and a tie was placed around the urinary meatus to
          preserve isovolumetric conditions. After infusing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.1</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.2</NUMEX>
          ml into the bladder the distal, cut end of the pelvic
          nerve was stimulated with a long train (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5 Hz; 1</ENAMEX> msec
          pulse width; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">sec train</ENAMEX>; <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX>-300 (uamps) to elicit a
          prolonged contraction displaying <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> phases: Phase I, a
          rapid contraction and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Phase II</ENAMEX>, a plateau phase [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20 21</NUMEX> ]
          . Phase I is resistant to atropine, and therefore is
          mostly due to non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic activation,
          whereas Phase <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> is highly sensitive to muscarinic
          blockade [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Olanzapine</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) and risperidone (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> =
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) were administered (<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.01,0.1,1 and 10 mg/kg</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.</ENAMEX>v.) and
          the stimulations were repeated at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 minutes</TIMEX> intervals.
          At the end of each experiment, all rats were overdosed
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">urethane i.</ENAMEX>v.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> analysis
          Bladder pressure and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EUS-EMG</ENAMEX> during the
          cystometrograms were displayed in an electronic chart
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">recorder</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RC Electronics; Goleta</ENAMEX>, CA) and analyzed
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">off-line</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dataview</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">W.J. Heitler</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">St Andrews</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Scotland</ENAMEX>). The following parameters were examined from
          the cystometrogram as described in detail earlier [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] :
          bladder capacity (amount of fluid infused to elicit a
          contraction); micturition volume (amount of fluid
          expelled); residual volume ([bladder capacity -
          micturition volume]/ [bladder capacity]); pressure
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">threshold</ENAMEX> (pressure at which contraction begins); peak
          pressure (maximal pressure during contraction);
          contraction time; expulsion time (time between peak
          pressure and end of high frequency oscillations);
          amplitude of high frequency oscillations. The EMG
          activity was examined by dividing the bladder contraction
          into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> phases in a modification of the technique of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chien et al.</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] a contraction phase (phase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>); an
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">expulsion</ENAMEX> phase (phase <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>) and a closing phase (phase
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>).
          The raw <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">EMG</ENAMEX> was rectified, integrated (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">0.5 second bin</TIMEX>)
          and the area under curve of the EMG corresponding to each
          phase of the bladder contraction was measured (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sigma</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scan/Image; Jandel Scientifics</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Rafael</ENAMEX>, Ca). Drug
          effects were calculated <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as percent</NUMEX> of control.
          In the case of bladder contractions induced by pelvic
          nerve stimulation, the amplitude of phase A and Phase B
          were compared to drug free control values.
          Values are presented as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mean ± S.E.M. Repeated</ENAMEX>
          measures <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANOVA</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GB Stat; Dynamic Microsystems</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">MD</ENAMEX>) were
          performed on all parameters and when statistical
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">significance</ENAMEX> (p <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>) was obtained, comparisons
          between control and different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">drug</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">dosages</ENAMEX> were made
          using <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fisher</ENAMEX>'s protected t-test [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50</TIMEX> ] .
