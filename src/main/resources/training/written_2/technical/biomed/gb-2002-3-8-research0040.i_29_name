        Power-law behaviors have been observed in many different
        population distributions. Also known as <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Zipf's law</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>],
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> of the most famous examples is the usage of words in
        text documents [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. On grouping words that occur in
        similar numbers, it was noted that a small selection of
        words such as 'the' and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">'of'</ENAMEX>, are used many times, while
        most other words are used infrequently. When the size of
        each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> is plotted against its usage, the distribution
        can be approximated to a power-law function; that is, the
        number of words 
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>) with a given occurrence 
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">F</ENAMEX>) decays according to the equation 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> = 
        aF - 
        b . This distribution has a linear
        appearance when plotted on double-logarithmic axes, where 
        -b describes the slope. (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Strictly</ENAMEX>
        speaking, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zipf</ENAMEX>'s law plots the frequency of occurrence of a
        word against its rank, where words are ranked according to
        their occurrence. In addition, the exponent 
        b in the power-law function must be
        close to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. Here instead of the rank, we plot the number of
        words with similar occurrences and do not require an
        exponent of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). Some other examples of this behavior
        include income levels [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>], relative sizes of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">cities</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]
        and the connectivity of nodes in large networks [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>] such
        as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Wide Web</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX>].
        In regard to genomic biology, Mantegna 
        et al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>] discussed the fact that
        the usage of short base sequences in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>, or 'DNA words',
        also follows the power law. They concluded that the
        behavior applies better to non-coding than to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-coding sequences</ENAMEX> and suggested that non-coding DNA
        resembles a natural language. Further instances cited in
        genomic biology include the occurrence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> families
        or folds [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5, 6, 7, 8, 9</ENAMEX>], the connectivity within
        metabolic pathways [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>] and the number of intra- and
        intermolecular interactions made by <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11, 12</TIMEX>,
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX>].
        From the analysis of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 20</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> genomes
        sequenced, we show that power-law behavior is prominent
        throughout genomic biology. As noted above, previous
        studies have cited the occurrence of power-law behaviors
        for individual properties. Here we report the behavior for
        further genomic properties that have not previously been
        found; in particular, for the occurrence of pseudogene and
        pseudomotif <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> in the intergenic regions of
        genomes, the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> functions associated with a
        particular fold, and the number of expressed mRNA
        transcripts within a cell. Furthermore, we bring together
        all the individual observations within a single framework
        and demonstrate that the power-law behavior is prevalent
        across most different genomic properties. Finally, in
        presenting these data, we discuss the significance of power
        laws in biology and discuss several models that aim to
        describe how genomes evolved to their current <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">states</ENAMEX> to
        produce this type of behavior.
      
      
        Results
        
          Genomic occurrence of 'mers, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> and
          folds
          We start with the usage of short DNA sequences in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genomes</ENAMEX>; we consider DNA words of size 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n</ENAMEX> , termed 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">n -mers</ENAMEX>, and count the occurrence
          of distinct words by shifting across the entire genome
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base</ENAMEX> at a time. By grouping the different 'mers by
          their occurrences, we observe that the occurrence of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>-
          to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>-mers displays power-law-like behavior. Figure
          1ashows the distributions of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6- to 10-mers</NUMEX> in the 
          Caenorhabditis elegans genome. The
          distribution for each 'mer is staggered, which,
          unsurprisingly, indicates that shorter words have a
          higher average occurrence in the genome than longer ones.
          A more unexpected feature of the plot is that the slopes
          for the different-length words are nearly identical ( 
          b = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.2</NUMEX>), indicating that the
          number of 'mers with given occurrences fall at similar
          rates regardless of their length (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). Moreover, we
          find that 'mers in both coding and non-coding regions
          follow the power-law distribution equally well (see
          Additional data).
          Having observed the occurrence of short 'mers, we now
          shift our focus towards the coding regions of genomes.
          Most <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> encoded in a genome can be grouped
          according to their similarity in three-dimensional
          structure or amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid sequence</ENAMEX>. The most common
          classifications of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are the fold, superfamily and
          family [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX>]; each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">class</ENAMEX> is a subset of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> before,
          and groups <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> with increasing similarity. First,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are defined to have a common fold if their
          secondary structural elements occupy the same spatial
          arrangement and have the same topological <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">connections</ENAMEX>.
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are grouped into the same superfamily if
          they share the same fold, and are deemed to share a
          common evolutionary origin, owing to a similar protein
          function, for example. Both the fold and superfamily
          classes aim to group <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that are structurally
          related, but whose similarities cannot necessarily be
          detected only by their sequences. Finally, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are
          grouped into the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> if their amino-acid
          sequences are considered similar, most commonly using a
          measure of percentage sequence identity or an 
          E -value cut-off. Alternatively,
          they can also be characterized by the presence of a
          particular sequence 'signature' or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">'motif</NUMEX>. Here, we have
          used the fold and superfamily assignments from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SCOP</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX>] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Superfamily</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">databases</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX>] and the family
          classifications from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">InterPro</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16, 17</TIMEX>].
          By analogy with the earlier 'mers, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> encoded in
          a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">genome</ENAMEX> can be thought of as longer DNA words.
          Therefore, by grouping <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in the classification
          system above, we can measure the occurrences of
          collections of sequences of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">around 1,000-mers</NUMEX> in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genome</ENAMEX>. As we explained above, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the same
          superfamily have often diverged beyond detectable
          sequence similarity and, in the case of folds, may have
          independently converged to similar structures from
          unrelated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA sequences</ENAMEX>. Nevertheless, the occurrences of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>, superfamilies, and folds in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worm</ENAMEX>
          approximate to a power-law behavior quite well (Figure
          1a). In fact, despite the differing definitions of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>, superfamilies and folds, the resulting
          distributions for each group are very similar. Compared
          with the <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6- to 10-mers</NUMEX>, the distributions fall off more
          gradually ( 
          b = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.0</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.2</NUMEX>); this indicates a
          greater difference in the relative occurrence of the most
          and least common <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>.
          Returning to the non-coding regions of the genome, we
          also plotted the occurrence of pseudogene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pseudomotifs</ENAMEX> found in intergenic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1b</NUMEX>). Whole
          pseudogenes were found by searching for matches to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SWISS-PROT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein sequences</ENAMEX> in intergenic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>, and are
          usually characterized by frameshift mutations or early
          stop codons that prevent normal transcription or
          translation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18, 19</TIMEX>]. Therefore, they encode
          non-functional <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein sequences</ENAMEX>. As with functional
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX>, pseudogenes were classified into <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> using
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">InterPro</ENAMEX>. Pseudomotifs were found by matching PROSITE
          motifs in intergenic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> and are thought to be more
          ancient pseudogenes that have accumulated so many
          mutations that only small fragments of recognizable
          motifs remain (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Z.Z.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">M.G.</ENAMEX>, unpublished observations).
          These fragments are classified according to the PROSITE
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">classification</ENAMEX>. As shown in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1b</TIMEX>, the occurrences of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pseudogenes</ENAMEX> and the fragments also follow a power law.
          The distribution for pseudogenes is similar to that for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">protein families</ENAMEX> and folds ( 
          b = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.8</NUMEX>); this is expected, as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pseudogenes</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worm</ENAMEX> represent a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of DNA
          sequences that used to encode functional <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. The
          distribution of occurrences for pseudomotifs ( 
          b = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.9</NUMEX>) has a wide spread and
          actually bridges those of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> and 'mers.
          This is probably because the most frequently occurring
          PROSITE motifs are only <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-10 amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> in length, and
          therefore are similar to 'mers, whereas the less
          frequently occurring motifs are longer (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">82</NUMEX> amino-acid
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">residues</ENAMEX>), and so resemble protein <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>.
          Our findings for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worm genome</ENAMEX> also apply to at
          least <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> other prokaryotic and eukaryotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>.
          Figure 1cshows <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">InterPro</ENAMEX> family distributions in 
          Mycoplasma genitalium, Escherichia
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">coli</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saccharomyces</ENAMEX> cerevisiae and 
          Drosophila melanogaster ; other
          distributions from many of the recently sequenced genomes
          are available from our website [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>]. Interestingly,
          smaller genomes ( 
          b = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.0</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.0</NUMEX>) tend to have a steeper
          fall-off than larger genomes; with fewer genes, it would
          seem natural to expect a narrower distribution in these
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX>. Given the prevalence of the power-law
          behavior, it is likely to be universal to other genomes
          yet to be analyzed.
        
        
          Functions, interactions and expression
          levels
          The power law is not only found in the occurrence of
          words, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>, and folds, but also extends to further
          genomic features of biological macromolecules. As shown
          in Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1d</TIMEX>, the distribution fits the number of
          distinct functions held by a particular protein fold [
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21, 22</TIMEX>]. Most <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">folds</ENAMEX> are only associated with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</NUMEX> or
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> functions, whereas a few, such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">TIM</ENAMEX> barrel,
          have <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to 16</NUMEX> ( 
          b = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.2</NUMEX>). The behavior also applies
          to the number of distinct <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-protein</ENAMEX> interactions
          made by different folds ( 
          b = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.2</NUMEX>) and the number of
          transcripts for each protein <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> in a given
          cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">state</ENAMEX> ( 
          b = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.6</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Is the power-law function the best fit?
          We have so far demonstrated that disparate types of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> display power-law behavior. Not all genomic
          properties follow a power law, however, and examples
          include occurrences of 'mers shorter than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">bases</ENAMEX>, the
          occurrence of particular amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, and the
          number of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> that are involved in protein
          flexibility (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1f</NUMEX>).
          The original <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">publication</ENAMEX> by Mantegna 
          et al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>] resulted in a prolonged
          debate as to whether the power law is actually the best
          fit for the 'mer distribution [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28</TIMEX>],
          and similar discussions are found for power-law behavior
          outside biology [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29, 30, 31, 32</TIMEX>]. Previous publications
          have only tested the suitability of individual functions.
          In Figure <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1e</TIMEX>, however, we examine the best-fit curves of
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> alternative functions for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-fold occurrence
          in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worm</ENAMEX>: linear, exponential, double-exponential,
          triple-exponential, stretched-exponential, lognormal and
          Yule distributions. The <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">Yule</ENAMEX> distribution in particular
          was reported as providing a better fit for the occurrence
          of 'mers than the power law [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>], and the
          stretched-exponential and lognormal distributions have
          been cited as providing good fits for non-biological
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>.
          We measure the fit of each function by calculating the
          residual between actual <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-fold occurrence and the
          mathematical functions as follows:
          
          R = ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> ( 
          actual ) - 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fitted</ENAMEX> )) 2
          For example, for the fits in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1ewe</NUMEX> use the
          following equation:
          
          R 
          
            folds 
           <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">=</ENAMEX> ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> 
          
            folds 
           ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worm</ENAMEX> ) - 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX> 
          
            folds 
           ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">fitted</ENAMEX> )) 2
          In this calculation, a smaller residual 
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">R</ENAMEX>) indicates a better fit between
          the data and the mathematical functions.
          The main differences in the fit appear at the tail of
          the distribution, at high fold occurrences. Although most
          functions describe the lower end of the distribution
          well, they do not extend far enough at the upper end of
          the distribution. The linear and single-exponential
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">curves</ENAMEX> clearly do not describe the data well. The
          double-exponential curve provides a reasonable fit for
          lower genomic occurrences, but diverges from the data at
          higher values. The same applies for the
          stretched-exponential and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yule</ENAMEX> distributions.
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> functions perform well: the triple-exponential and
          the lognormal distributions. In fact, the
          triple-exponential displays a smaller residual than the
          power-law function and one would expect higher-order
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">exponentials</ENAMEX> to provide increasingly better fits.
          However, this is at the expense of having more free
          parameters to fine-tune the shape of the curve. As the
          fold distribution actually displays a wide spread of
          values - especially for higher occurrences (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1a,1</NUMEX>d)
          - we conclude that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all three</NUMEX> mathematical functions
          describe the data equally well. The same also applies to
          the other genomic data we discussed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX>. However,
          given the fit across many different biological
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">distributions</ENAMEX>, combined with the relative simplicity of
          the function compared to the higher-order-exponential and
          lognormal distributions, we suggest that the power law
          provides the best description of the data.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        
          The significance of power-law behavior
          Although the power-law behavior has previously been
          detected in individual biological distributions [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4, 5,</ENAMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13</TIMEX>], this is the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time it
          has been reported for such a wide group of properties
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with genomes. Moreover, here we demonstrate
          for the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> time that power-law distributions are
          applicable to the occurrence of pseudogenes and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pseudomotifs</ENAMEX> in intergenic regions, the number of
          functions associated with a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> fold, and the
          expression levels of different <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>.
          At <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> glance, these observations might appear to be
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'biological</ENAMEX> trivia'. However, power-law behavior actually
          provides a concise mathematical description of an
          important biological feature: the sheer dominance of a
          few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> over the overall <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. For example, out
          of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">247</NUMEX> distinct <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein folds</ENAMEX> currently assigned in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">worm</ENAMEX> genome, just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> account for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over half</NUMEX> of the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7,805</NUMEX> assigned domains. The top fold, the
          immunoglobulin-like β-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sandwich</ENAMEX>, accounts for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 829</NUMEX>
          (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10.6%</NUMEX>) domains in the genome. For <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein superfamilies</ENAMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">606</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> account for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15,450</NUMEX>
          assigned domains, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 37</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,936</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">InterPro</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>
          match <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12,589</NUMEX> assigned <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. Half of all
          pseudogenes belong to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10</NUMEX> (out of a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX>) protein
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>, and just <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> types of motif make up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over half</NUMEX>
          of pseudogenic PROSITE fragments.
          Power-law behavior also describes similar underlying
          observations for the remaining data. For <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>-protein
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">interactions</ENAMEX>, we find that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX> out of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein folds</ENAMEX> in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast genome</ENAMEX> make up <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">89</NUMEX> known
          combinations of interdomain interactions, and for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gene</ENAMEX>-expression levels in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">just 12</NUMEX>
          out of a total <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">145</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">folds</ENAMEX> comprise <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</NUMEX> of all the
          transcripts in the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">cell</ENAMEX> at any given <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">state</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          Power-law behavior and the underlying evolutionary
          mechanism
          Having discussed the significance of power-law
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">behaviors</ENAMEX>, this leads us to the question of how genomes
          achieved these distributions. Given a mathematical
          description common to many genomes and different genomic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">properties</ENAMEX>, it is possible to define evolutionary models
          that replicate the power-law distributions. Recently,
          several <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">papers</ENAMEX> have attempted to answer this question
          from a theoretical perspective by building mathematical
          models for evolution.
          Mantegna 
          et al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>] drew analogies with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zipf</ENAMEX>'s original work to suggest that the behavior for
          'mers originate from similarities between <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> sequences
          and natural languages. This suggestion attracted
          extensive criticism [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28</TIMEX>] and the
          work of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Li</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX>] demonstrated that power-law-like
          behavior could in fact simply arise from non-equal
          occurrences of words in random texts. Shorter <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">'mers</TIMEX> (<
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">6-mers</TIMEX>) fail to display power-law behavior because there
          are insufficient numbers of distinct words to
          differentiate levels of occurrence. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>- and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-mers
          have larger numbers of distinct sequences and there are
          hints of power-law behavior in the tails of their
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">distributions</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1d</NUMEX>). For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6</NUMEX>-mers and above, the
          reason that words of different lengths have identical
          slopes is because their distributions are not independent
          of each other; longer words also contain combinations of
          the shorter words.
          Although random <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> sequences provide a possible
          explanation for power-law behavior with 'mers, the same
          is unlikely to apply to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein sequences</ENAMEX>. Rather, at
          these levels the distributions probably arise from
          evolutionary development centered on an underlying
          process of gene duplication. If we treat gene duplication
          as a stochastic process, the chance of a given gene being
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">duplicated</ENAMEX> is proportional to its occurrence in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genome</ENAMEX>. With each duplication, some genes increase their
          presence in the genome, enhancing their chance of further
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">duplication</ENAMEX>. Combined with selective pressure accounting
          for the functional significance of different protein
          products, such a process gives prominence to some gene
          types, or <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>, over others. Previous studies outside
          genomic biology have linked such stochastic dynamical
          processes to power laws [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">34, 35, 36, 37</TIMEX>].
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> evolutionary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> proposed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Huynen</ENAMEX> and van
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nimwegen</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>], Yanai 
          et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX>] and Qian 
          et al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>] successfully replicated
          the observed biological data using such a duplicative
          process. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">All three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> rely heavily on gene
          duplication as the underlying process and, in fact, this
          process on its own results in an exponential
          distribution. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">model</ENAMEX> achieves the power-law
          distribution by emulating biological processes that
          perturb the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">duplicative</ENAMEX> processes; this is done by
          including parameters that mimic selective pressure, point
          mutations or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral</ENAMEX> gene transfer.
          In the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> model, of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Huynen</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">van Nimwegen</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>],
          gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> start the simulation with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> each.
          Each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> is allowed to expand or contract in size
          through successive <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">multiplications</ENAMEX> with a random factor,
          which represents duplication or deletion events depending
          on its value. In the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> model, that of Yanai 
          et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX>], genomes evolve from a
          set of precursor genes to a mature size by random gene
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">duplications</ENAMEX> and gradual accumulation of modifications
          through point mutations. When an individual <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> member
          acquires enough random mutations, it breaks away to form
          a new <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>. Finally in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> model, that of Qian 
          et al. [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>], genomes evolve from
          their initial small size using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> basic operations:
          first, duplication of existing genes to expand the size
          of existing <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX>, the introduction of
          completely new <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lateral</ENAMEX> transfer from other
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> or 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ab</ENAMEX> initio creation. Both components
          are vital for replicating the observed data. In this
          paper, we have discussed the finding that genomic
          distributions first take on an exponential appearance and
          then adopt a power-law behavior after a sufficiently long
          evolutionary process. In a similar vein, a recent paper
          by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rzhetsky</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gomez</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX>] introduced a model in which
          the underlying DNA duplication mechanism, combined with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">random</ENAMEX> production of an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">inter-protein interaction</ENAMEX>,
          successfully simulates the power-law distribution for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">interaction</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">networks</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX>.
          This leads us to speculate on a possible explanation
          of power-law behaviors for the other properties. For
          protein functions, folds with high occurrence in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genome</ENAMEX> also tend to have diverse functions; thus the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX>-loop-containing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NTP</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hydrolase</ENAMEX> fold is found <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">130</NUMEX> times
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX> and has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least six</NUMEX> distinct enzymatic
          functions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX>]. Parallel to this, we find that folds
          with many <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-protein interactions</ENAMEX> also tend to hold
          more diverse functions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX>]; for example, the NTP
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">hydrolase</ENAMEX> fold is currently associated with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</NUMEX>
          interdomain interactions within <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX>. Finally, the state
          of the transcription-regulatory mechanism in a particular
          cellular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">state</ENAMEX> clearly has the most important role in
          determining gene-expression levels. However, it has
          previously been shown that some gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> with high
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">occurrences</ENAMEX> also display high expression levels under
          diverse experimental conditions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX>]. Finally, the
          occurrence of pseudogene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> is related to the
          occurrence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> from which they
          originate. In addition, a major method of producing
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pseudogenes</ENAMEX> is through reverse transcription of expressed
          mRNA, and so their occurrences are actually related to
          expression levels of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>. Given the
          correlation of all the different genomic properties with
          the occurrence of gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> in the genome, we can
          reason that they are connected to an underlying
          duplicative process.
          The main arguments supporting the view that all
          power-law <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">behaviours</ENAMEX> are arise from a common duplicative
          process are that the occurrences of different genomic
          properties are correlated and the fits between the
          distributions of biological and simulated data are good.
          Although these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> are based on well-known biological
          processes, there is, unfortunately, little experimental
          evidence to directly confirm the validity of these
          models. However, it is worth noting that most of the
          properties that do not follow a power law (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1d</NUMEX>) are
          those that are clearly not directly connected with gene
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">duplication</ENAMEX>.
