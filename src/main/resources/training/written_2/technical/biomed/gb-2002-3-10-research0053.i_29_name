        Retrotransposons are mobile genetic elements that make
        up a large fraction of most eukaryotic genomes. They are
        particularly abundant in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX>, where they are often a
        principal component of nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>. In <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">maize</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50-80%</NUMEX>, and in
        wheat fully <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX>, of the genome is made up of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">retrotransposons</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1, 2</ENAMEX>]. In <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> this percentage is
        generally lower than in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> but can still be large. For
        example, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 40%</NUMEX> of the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genome</ENAMEX> is now known to
        be composed of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">retroelements</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3, 4</ENAMEX>].
        All retrotransposons are distinguished by a life cycle
        involving an <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA intermediate</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">RNA</ENAMEX> genome of a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">retroelement</ENAMEX> is copied into a double-stranded DNA molecule
        by reverse transcriptase and is subsequently integrated
        into the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX>'s genome. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Retrotransposons</ENAMEX> fall into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> main
        categories, those with long terminal repeats (LTRs), such
        as retroviruses and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTR</ENAMEX> retrotransposons, and those that
        lack such repeats, (for example, long interspersed nuclear
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LINEs</ENAMEX>).
        Our <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratory</ENAMEX> is in the process of screening the
        GenBank <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX> ( 
        Oryza sativa ) database (GBRD) and
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monsanto</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice dataset</ENAMEX> (MRD) for the presence of LTR
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">retrotransposons</ENAMEX>. We have chosen to scan the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX> genome
        because, as the most important <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">food</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">crop</ENAMEX> in the world, much
        of its sequence data is already available. With a haploid
        content of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">430 million</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">base</ENAMEX> pairs (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mbp</ENAMEX>), the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice genome</ENAMEX> is
        the smallest among cultivated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cereals</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5, 6</ENAMEX>] and only
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about three</NUMEX> times larger than the smallest known genome
        among angiosperms, that of 
        Arabidopsis thaliana (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~130 Mbp</NUMEX>). 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O. sativa</ENAMEX> has one of the smallest
        genomes among grasses as a whole [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX>]. Genomes of other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cereals</ENAMEX> are far larger. For example, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">maize</ENAMEX> ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zea mays</ENAMEX> ) genome is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2,500</NUMEX> million
        base pairs (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gbp</ENAMEX>) and that of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">wheat</ENAMEX> ( 
        Triticum aestivum ), <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gbp</ENAMEX>. The
        molecular genetic resources for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX> are excellent,
        including detailed physical and genetic maps, large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YAC</ENAMEX> and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BAC</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">libraries</ENAMEX>, an efficient transformation system, and an
        extensive collection of expressed sequence tags (ESTs).
        We have used a new search program, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTR_STRUC</ENAMEX> (LTR
        retrotransposon structure program; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">E.M.M. and J.F.M.</ENAMEX>,
        unpublished work), as the initial data-mining tool in our
        survey. Structural features important to the algorithm on
        which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTR</ENAMEX>_STRUC is based include <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> sites critical to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">replication</ENAMEX>, the primer-binding site (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>) and polypurine
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">tract</ENAMEX> (PPT), as well as the presence of canonical
        dinucleotides at the ends of each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTR</ENAMEX> (typically <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TG</ENAMEX> and
        CA). Particularly important are the direct or 'target-site'
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">repeats</ENAMEX> (TSRs). When an LTR retrotransposon inserts itself
        into host <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>, a short (usually <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4-6 bp</ENAMEX>) segment of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host</ENAMEX> DNA
        is replicated at the site of insertion. This feature allows
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTR</ENAMEX>_STRUC to make an exact demarcation of the limits of a
        putative element. Because it searches for retroelements on
        the basis of their generic structure, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTR</ENAMEX>_STRUC eliminates
        much of the bias inherent in BLAST searches based on a
        known retroelement query. After <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> were initially
        identified using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTR</ENAMEX>_STRUC, sequence analyses were carried
        out to identify open reading frames (ORFs) encoding reverse
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">transcriptase</ENAMEX> (RT) and other retrotransposon <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>.
        Subsequent RT sequence alignments were carried out,
        followed by construction of phylogenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RTs</ENAMEX> from elements identified in our survey fall into
        numerous distinct <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>, where 'family' is defined as a
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RTs</ENAMEX> having mutual similarity of at
        least <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX> at the amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid</ENAMEX> level [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>]. In addition, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
        types of non-autonomous elements discussed here lack RT
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> ( 
        Osr25, <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Osr37/Rire4</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Osr43</TIMEX> , and 
        Osr44 ), and were classified as
        distinct <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> on the basis of their unique structures
        (see below).
        Currently, there is no consensus with respect to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX>
        retrotransposon nomenclature. In our method of
        nomenclature, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice LTR</ENAMEX> retrotransposons are specified by
        the appellation 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Osr</ENAMEX> ( 
        Oryza sativa retrotransposon).
        Distinct <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> are indicated by number (for example, 
        Osr1, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Osr2</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Osr3</TIMEX> , . . .). There have
        been <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> different nomenclatures previously used in
        reference to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice LTR retrotransposons</ENAMEX>: 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tos</ENAMEX> (transposon 
        Oryza sativa ) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX>], 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rire</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice retrotransposon</ENAMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX>] 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rrt</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice retrotransposon</ENAMEX>) (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S. Wang</ENAMEX>,
        submission to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EMBL</ENAMEX> database: 
        Rtr3 (accession number <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">T03666</NUMEX>), 
        Rrt5 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">T03669</NUMEX>), and 
        Rrt8 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">T03671</NUMEX>)), and 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Osr</ENAMEX> ( 
        Oryza sativa retrotransposon) (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N.</ENAMEX>
        Jwa, submission to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX>: 
        Osr1 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">AB046118</NUMEX>)). We have chosen to
        adopt the 
        Osr nomenclature in this study
        because it is consistent with the systematic logic
        (indicative of genus and species of host <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">organism</ENAMEX>) used in
        previous genomic studies of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTR</ENAMEX> retrotransposons and
        includes the letter 'r' to indicate retrotransposon.
        However, in every case where we use the 
        Osr acronym in this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX> to refer to
        a previously named <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, we also include any pre-existing
        name(s) for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> (for example, 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Osr15/Tos12, Osr26/Rire2</ENAMEX> ).
      
      
        Results and discussion
        
          Intra-element percent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTR</ENAMEX> nucleotide
          identity
          Because of the replication process characteristic of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTR</ENAMEX> retrotransposons, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTRs</ENAMEX> of a given retroelement
          are sequentially identical at the time the element
          inserts into the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">host genome</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX>]. Thereafter, as an
          element accumulates mutations, its LTRs become increasing
          different from each other as substitutions specific for
          each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTRs</ENAMEX> increase in number. The level of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">nucleotide</ENAMEX> identity seen between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTRs</ENAMEX> of a particular
          element, usually referred to as intra-element percent LTR
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">nucleotide</ENAMEX> identity (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">%</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LNI</ENAMEX>), can be used in determining
          the relative ages of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTR</ENAMEX> retrotransposon <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>].
          In <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX>, comparison of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTRs</ENAMEX> of the same element
          often showed the presence of a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10 to 30</TIMEX> bp regional
          duplication present in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTR</ENAMEX> but not the other. In
          calculating <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">%</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LNI</ENAMEX>, we have considered such duplications as
          single mutation events.
          As the neutral nucleotide substitution rate has yet to
          be computed for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX>, we cannot presently equate <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">%</NUMEX>LNI
          with a divergence time in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>. However, the generally
          low level of sequence divergence between flanking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTRs</ENAMEX> of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rice LTR</ENAMEX> retrotransposons (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.7%</NUMEX>) indicates that most of
          the euchromatic full-length <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTR</ENAMEX> retrotransposons in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX>
          are relatively young, although significantly older
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> were also identified. The seeming preponderance
          of young full-length <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTR</ENAMEX> retrotransposons in the
          euchromatin of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX> is similar to previous reports on
          yeast [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19, 20</TIMEX>], 
          Caenorhabditis elegans [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>], 
          A. thaliana [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>] and 
          Drosophila melanogaster [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>]. This
          contrasts with findings in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Z. mays</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX>] and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>].
        
        
          Copia-like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>
          To date, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> of 
          copia -like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> have been
          reported for <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S. Wang</ENAMEX>, submission to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EMBL</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">N. Jwa</ENAMEX>,
          submission to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">GenBank</ENAMEX>, and [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8, 9, 19</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23, 24</TIMEX>]). Several
          have been described under <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> name. For
          example, the amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid sequence</ENAMEX> given for 
          Tos4 in Hirochika 
          et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>] is the same as that
          given for 
          Tos1 in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">GenBank</ENAMEX> (accession number
          S22455) so they are really the same. 
          Rire5 described by Kumekawa 
          et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>] is the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> as 
          Tos14 previously described by
          Hirochika 
          et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX>]. The equivalence
          between 
          Tos14 and 
          Rire5 became evident when we found
          the LTR sequence reported by Kumekawa 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">et al.</ENAMEX> in elements that also
          contained the RT sequence given by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hirochika</ENAMEX> for 
          Tos14. In our survey of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MRDB</ENAMEX>, we have identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an additional 16</NUMEX> 
          copia -like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> that have not
          been described by previous <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">workers</ENAMEX>. In addition,
          exemplars for each of the previously identified families
          were found (except in the case of certain <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> that
          exist at such low copy numbers that no full-length
          element exists in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">GenBank</ENAMEX> or MRDB).
        
        
          The largest copia-like family
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> of the most interesting new finds in our survey
          was 
          Osr8 , one of the oldest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTR</ENAMEX> retrotransposons in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice genome</ENAMEX>. On the basis
          of a survey of the available portion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GBRD</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MRD</ENAMEX>,
          we estimate the copy number of 
          Osr8 to be around <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1,100</NUMEX> (more than
          any other 
          copia -like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>). 
          Osr8 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> exist far more
          frequently as fragments (ratio of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) and they display
          relatively low levels of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">%</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LNI</ENAMEX> in their full-length copies
          (mean <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">%</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LNI</ENAMEX> for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> full-length 
          Osr8 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> present in the GBRD
          is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">97.2%</NUMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT</ENAMEX> of 
          Osr8 is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60%</NUMEX> similar to an unnamed
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">polyprotein</ENAMEX> in 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Z. mays</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">AAD20307</NUMEX>). A closely
          related <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, 
          Osr10 has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> full-length copies in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GBRD</ENAMEX> but scans of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MRD</ENAMEX> suggest this element, also
          previously unrecognized, has the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> highest copy
          number (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~400</NUMEX>) among 
          copia -like elements. Outside <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX>,
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT</ENAMEX> of 
          Osr10 shows highest similarity
          (~<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">65%</NUMEX>) to that of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">maize</ENAMEX> retrotransposon 
          Opie-2 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">T04112</NUMEX>). The broader clade
          that includes 
          Osr7, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Osr8</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Osr9</TIMEX> , and 
          Osr10 is closely related to 
          Endovir1-1 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">AAG52949</NUMEX>) of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabidopsis</ENAMEX> (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>).
          These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> are also related (~<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60%</NUMEX> similar) to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">maize</ENAMEX>'s
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">PREM-2</ENAMEX> as well as to tomato's 
          ToRTL1. Both 
          Osr7 and 
          Osr9 are present in very low copy
          number (one full-length and a few fragments in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GBRD</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Osr14/Tos1/Tos4, Osr15/Tos12and Osr53/</ENAMEX>Tos18
          Although it is present at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only about a quarter</NUMEX> of the
          copy number of 
          Osr8 , the unrelated 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Osr14/Tos1/Tos4</ENAMEX> is also composed
          primarily of highly fragmented elements. Those that are
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">full</TIMEX> length have <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">low %</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LNI</ENAMEX> (family mean <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">97.6%</NUMEX>). Thus, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Osr14/Tos1/Tos4</ENAMEX> and 
          Osr8 seem to be of similar age and
          to have followed a similar evolutionary pattern, albeit
          with less intense amplification in the case of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Osr14/Tos1/Tos4.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Osr14/Tos1/Tos4,</ENAMEX>

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">clade</ENAMEX> and are more closely related to 
          Ta1-2 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">S23315</NUMEX>) of 
          Arabidopsis than to any other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX>

          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Osr15/Tos12</ENAMEX> and

          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Osr1/Tos14/Rire5, Osr13/Tos5,</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Osr51/Tos15</ENAMEX> , and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Osr52/Tos16</ENAMEX> have been described as
          distinct <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> but, inasmuch as their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RTs</ENAMEX> are all <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">85%</NUMEX>
          similar to each other, these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> are only marginally
          distinct. Searches of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GenBank</ENAMEX> show that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> in this
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> are much more closely related to (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">75-80%</NUMEX> at the

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fourf</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">AAK73108</NUMEX>) than to any <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTR</ENAMEX> retrotransposon outside their clade. If the elements
          belonging to this group were considered to be a single
          family, it would be almost as large (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~900</NUMEX> elements) as 
          Osr8. In the GBRD the majority of
          these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> are fragmentary, but the estimated copy
          number of full-length elements in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice genome</ENAMEX> for
          this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">quartet</ENAMEX> still exceeds <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX>.
        
        
          A <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hopscotch</ENAMEX>-like clade of fragmented
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX>
          
          Osr18, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Osr19</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Osr20</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Osr22</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Osr23</TIMEX>,

          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Osr46/Tos8</ENAMEX> form a clade of low copy
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">number families</ENAMEX> composed primarily of fragmentary copies.
          Our results suggest that each of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> has a
          copy number in the range of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</NUMEX>-100 elements. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Members</ENAMEX> of
          this clade are closely related to <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">maize</ENAMEX>'s 
          Hopscotch element (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">T04112</NUMEX>) (Figure
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          Low copy number copia-like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>
          
          Osr2 and 
          Osr12 are low-copy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> and are
          represented in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GBRD</ENAMEX> by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> copies
          respectively, all of which are full length (although one
          copy of 
          Osr12 contains a large internal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">deletion</ENAMEX>), suggesting that these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> may have
          recently invaded the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice genome</ENAMEX>. The high level of LTR
          <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">nucleotide</ENAMEX> identity (≥ <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99%</NUMEX>) seen in these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> is
          consistent with this recent invasion hypothesis. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Members</ENAMEX>
          of 
          Osr12 and 
          Osr2 are potentially active because
          they have large, intact polyprotein <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX>, usually in
          excess of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,000</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">All three</NUMEX> 
          Osr12 elements detected in the GBRD
          are on chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>. Similarly, both 
          Osr2 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> are inserted within
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">50 kb</TIMEX> of each other on chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>. Nonetheless, these
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> are not closely related (their RT sequences
          are only ~<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> similar at the amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid</ENAMEX> level). 
          Osr12 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RTs</ENAMEX> differ from those of all
          other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX> 
          copia -like elements by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX>. And
          yet <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">RT</ENAMEX> sequences of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> in 
          Osr12 are <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60%</NUMEX> similar to certain
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">maize genome</ENAMEX> ( 
          Zmr1 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">S27768</NUMEX>) and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mzecopia</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">M94481.1</NUMEX>)).
          One full-length, and one fragmented copy of 
          Osr6 are present in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GBRD</ENAMEX>. 
          Osr5 is slightly more common than 
          Osr6 , to which it is most closely
          related, but it is currently represented in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GBRD</ENAMEX> by
          only a single full-length copy and a few fragments. 
          Osr5 is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60%</NUMEX> similar to the tobacco
          retrotransposon 
          Tnt1-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">94</NUMEX> at the amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid</ENAMEX> level (RT
          comparison). 
          Osr4 is another low-copy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>. It
          has several fragmented <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representatives</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GBRD</ENAMEX>, and
          is probably somewhat older than 
          Osr12 and 
          Osr2 , but it has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only three</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">full-length</ENAMEX> copies in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GBRD</ENAMEX>, 
          Osr4 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> have an exceptionally
          large polyprotein <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORF</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~1,600</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>). The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT</ENAMEX> of 
          Osr4 shows <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> similarity to that
          of retroelements in the 
          Arabidopsis genome (for example,
          BAB01972, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NP</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">175303</ENAMEX>).
          Although the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT</ENAMEX> of 
          Osr3 was detected during our
          survey, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> in this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> are fragments with ill
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">defined LTRs</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">TBLASTN</ENAMEX> reveals the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT</ENAMEX> of 
          Osr3 to be the single
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">representative</ENAMEX> of its type in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GBRD</ENAMEX>. Both 
          Osr3 and the equally aberrant 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Osr21/Tos17</ENAMEX> differ from those of
          other 
          copia -like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> found in our
          study by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 55%</NUMEX>. 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Osr11/Rire1</ENAMEX> is a low-copy family
          closely related (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">75%</NUMEX> similarity) to a retroelement in the
          
          Arabidopsis genome ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Atr-2 , T01860</ENAMEX>). <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> other closely

          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Osr27/Rire9</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>] is the third
          largest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice genome</ENAMEX>, with an estimated copy
          number of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">900</NUMEX> elements, mostly full length. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Li</ENAMEX> 
          et al. [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">26</TIMEX>] estimated the copy
          number of this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,600</NUMEX>. The typical 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Osr27/Rire9</ENAMEX> element is quite large
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~12.8 kb</NUMEX> total length). Having intact polyprotein ORFs
          and high mean <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">%</NUMEX><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LNI</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99%</NUMEX>), these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> probably are, or
          recently have been, actively transposing. Yet the
          presence of a few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> that are more
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">mutated</ENAMEX> (short <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX>, low LTR-LTR nucleotide identity)
          suggests that this may also be an ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>. Two
          other <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>, 
          Osr40 and 
          Osr41 , are also <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the
          same clade as 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Osr27/Rire9, Osr25</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Osr26/Rire2</ENAMEX> ( 
          Osr25 and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Osr26/Rire2</ENAMEX> are discussed below),
          but both have <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RTs</ENAMEX> that are <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 30%</NUMEX> different from those
          of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Osr26/Rire2</ENAMEX> and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Osr27/Rire9.</ENAMEX> Neither 
          Osr40 nor 
          Osr41 has been previously
          identified, but with approximate copy numbers of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">600</NUMEX> and
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300</NUMEX>, respectively, these are both large <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RTs</ENAMEX>
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of this clade show <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 60%</NUMEX> similarity to
          that of 
          Retrosor1 ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">Sorghum bicolor</ENAMEX> , <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">AAD19359</TIMEX>).
          With <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 1,500</NUMEX> elements,

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">retrotransposons</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice genome</ENAMEX>. Although 
          Osr30 is the largest <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of LTR
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">retroelements</ENAMEX> in the genome, it has not been previously
          named. These <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> are slightly larger (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">~13.1 kb</NUMEX>) than
          those of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Osr27/Rire9.</ENAMEX> A higher proportion of
          fragmented copies and lower level of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTR-LTR</ENAMEX> nucleotide
          identity suggest that 
          Osr30 is older than 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Osr27/Rire9 .</ENAMEX> 
          Osr29 , which is closely allied to 
          Osr30 , is also a large <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> with
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 500</NUMEX> member elements. Taken together, the

          Osr29 and 
          Osr30 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">clade</ENAMEX> are unusual, because
          they are as closely related to other major <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX> clades as
          they are to any elements outside <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX>. 
          Osr28 is a low-copy <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> that is
          most closely related to 
          Osr29 and 
          Osr30 (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> other large

          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Osr33/Rire8</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>] and 
          Osr34. These <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> each have
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">copy</ENAMEX> numbers of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 500</NUMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</NUMEX> low-copy families

          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Osrs6/Rire3</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27</TIMEX>] (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Members</ENAMEX> of these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> have large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTRs</ENAMEX>, typically in

          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Osr31/Rire7</ENAMEX> is an aberrant low-copy

          have since been submitted to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">GenBank</ENAMEX> (for accession

          clades, we report these <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> types of elements as separate
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>. Estimates based on scans of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MRD</ENAMEX> and the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GBRD</ENAMEX> suggest that the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice genome</ENAMEX> contains <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 500</NUMEX>
          copies each of 
          Osr25 and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Osr26/Rire2 .</ENAMEX> 
          Osr25 and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Osr26/Rire2</ENAMEX> display <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">98.9 and 97.9%</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LNI</ENAMEX> respectively.
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Osr37/Rire4</ENAMEX> is also aberrant
          compared to other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice LTR</ENAMEX> retrotransposon <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>. The
          typical element in this <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4.4 kb long</NUMEX>, about the
          same length as 
          Osr25 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Members</ENAMEX> of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Osr37/Rire4</ENAMEX> usually carry a large
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORF</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">up to 600</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>) just upstream of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTR</ENAMEX>.
          This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORF</ENAMEX> shows no significant similarity to any known RT
          sequence. Up to the present in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GBRD</ENAMEX>, where these ORFs
          are generally identified simply as hypothetical <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>,
          the large <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORF</ENAMEX> of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Osr37/Rire4</ENAMEX> seems not to have been
          recognized as a retroviral gene. This <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORF</ENAMEX> may serve an
          integrase function as BLAST searches show that it has low
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homology</ENAMEX> to a putative integrase in 
          A. thaliana (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">28%</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">AC005171</ENAMEX>). There
          are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 600</NUMEX> copies of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Osr37/Rire4</ENAMEX> in the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genome</ENAMEX>.
          In addition to the foregoing 
          copia - and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gypsy</ENAMEX> -like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>, our scans
          identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX>, 
          Osr43 and 
          Osr44 , of small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> (overall
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">length < 2,000 bp</ENAMEX>). With LTRs <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only 148 bp</NUMEX> long and an
          overall length of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">1,207 bp</NUMEX>, 
          Osr44 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> are especially
          small. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Members</ENAMEX> of 
          Osr43 and 
          Osr44 are unique because, although
          they possess all of the canonical LTR-retrotransposon
          structural features (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTRs</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPT</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSRs</ENAMEX>), they are
          internally deleted and either completely lack or encode
          only very small <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ORFs</ENAMEX> with no similarity to any known
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>. Both <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> contain on the order of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</NUMEX> copies
          genome-wide.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rice LTR</ENAMEX> retrotransposons are a significant component of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice genome</ENAMEX>. We estimate that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTR</ENAMEX> retrotransposons
        constitute <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">at least 17%</NUMEX> of the 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">O. sativa genome.</ENAMEX> Although this value
        is lower than the estimated percentage of LTR
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">retrotransposons</ENAMEX> in the genomes of other cereal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2,</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>], it is more than tenfold greater than the estimated
        percentage of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTR</ENAMEX> retrotransposons in 
        A. thaliana , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> with a genome
        one-third the size of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice genome</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX>]. This
        disproportionate increase in the percentage of LTR
        retrotransposons as a function of genome size is consistent
        with the view that genome size variability in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> is
        often heavily dependent on variation in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTR</ENAMEX> retrotransposon
        content [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27, 28</TIMEX>].
        We have determined that individual full-length
        LTR-retrotransposons present in the sequenced euchromatic
        regions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice genome</ENAMEX> are all relatively young,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">displaying</ENAMEX>, on average, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">greater than 98%</NUMEX> sequence identity
        between their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTRs</ENAMEX>. Comparative genomic studies of LTR
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">retrotransposons</ENAMEX> in both <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">animals</ENAMEX> have revealed
        that <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> with smaller <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">genomes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">7, 10, 19, 20, 21</TIMEX>] do
        not harbor older <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTR</ENAMEX> retrotransposons, as do
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> with larger <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">genomes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12, 22</TIMEX>]. It has been
        hypothesized that the rate of turnover of retroelements may
        be higher in small genomes as a result of the presence of
        less effective epigenetic silencing mechanisms [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX>]. It
        remains to be determined whether or not this hypothesis is
        an adequate explanation of the apparent lack of older
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">full-length LTR</ENAMEX> retrotransposons in the euchromatic portion
        of the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice genome</ENAMEX>.
        In general, the major clades of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX> LTR
        retrotransposons are more closely related to elements
        present in other <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> than to the other clades of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX>, suggesting that horizontal transfer may have
        occurred over the evolutionary history of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX> LTR
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">retrotransposons</ENAMEX>. Further analysis is required to
        definitively test the horizontal transfer hypothesis.
        The newly developed search algorithm (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTR_STRUC</ENAMEX>) we have
        used in this study to initially identify LTR
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">retrotransposons</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice genome</ENAMEX> is not dependent upon
        sequence homology as are standard search methods such as
        BLAST. As a consequence, we identified several previously
        unreported <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice LTR</ENAMEX> retrotransposons consisting
        of non-coding and, in some cases, repeating, sequence
        motifs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTR</ENAMEX> retrotransposons of similar structure have
        recently been identified within the genomes of both
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">monocotyledonous</ENAMEX> and dicotyledonous <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>].
        Preliminary evidence suggests that these <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> may have
        a significant role in restructuring plant genomes over
        evolutionary time [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>].
      
      
        Materials and methods
        
          Automated characterization of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTR</ENAMEX> retrotransposons
          using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTR</ENAMEX>_STRUC
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">LTR_STRUC</ENAMEX> identifies new LTR retrotransposons on the
          basis of the presence of characteristic retroelement
          features (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">E.M.M. and J.F.M.</ENAMEX>, unpublished work). It scans
          nucleotide sequence data for putative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTR</ENAMEX> pairs, aligns
          the putative pairs, and scores them on the basis of the
          presence/absence of expected motifs such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TSRs</ENAMEX>,
          canonical dinucleotides, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PBS</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PPT</ENAMEX>, and so on. When a
          given <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX> receives a score above a (<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">user</ENAMEX>-specified)
          cut-off, an output record is generated that specifies
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">salient</ENAMEX> information about the putative element, such as
          the length of the transposon and its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTRs</ENAMEX>, its position
          within the contig, an alignment of its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTRs</ENAMEX>, the
          nucleotide sequence of the transposon, its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTRs</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">target-</ENAMEX>site repeats, as well as a file listing all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ORFs</ENAMEX>.
          In our study, once putative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> were identified,
          sequence analysis was carried out on the individual
          output files to identify those that described actual LTR
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">retrotransposons</ENAMEX>. Additional elements were identified by
          BLAST searches using elements located by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTR</ENAMEX>_STRUC as
          queries.
        
        
          Datasets scanned
          Initial scans with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTR</ENAMEX>_STRUC were conducted on a
          dataset consisting of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">29.8 Mb</ENAMEX> of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O.</ENAMEX> sativa <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">BAC-</ENAMEX>derived sequence data
          available in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">GenBank</ENAMEX> at the time of the initial scan
          (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 2000</TIMEX>). This dataset (TDS) was obtained from the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">TIGR</ENAMEX> website [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX>]. Subsequently, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTR</ENAMEX>_STRUC was used to
          scan the non-redundant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MRD</ENAMEX>, a product of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monsanto</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rice Genome Sequencing</ENAMEX> Project. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MRD</ENAMEX> is based on an
          initial dataset of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,391</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BACs</ENAMEX> distributed across the
          genome of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">O. sativa cv.</ENAMEX> Nipponbare - the same
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cultivar</ENAMEX> used by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Rice Genome</ENAMEX> Sequencing
          Project. Removal of contaminants and redundancies from
          this initial dataset produced the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MRD</ENAMEX> (consisting of
          52,202 contigs, totaling <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">259</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mb</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">430-Mb</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genome</ENAMEX>). More recently, in an effort to determine the
          relative copy numbers of the various <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">families</ENAMEX> and
          identify additional elements not picked up in our initial
          survey with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTR</ENAMEX>_STRUC, we have used representative
          sequences from each retrotransposon <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> identified in
          this study as queries to conduct BLAST searches against
          both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MRD</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GBRD</ENAMEX>. Thus, the results reported
          here constitute a reasonably unbiased survey of
          LTR-retrotransposon diversity in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX>. Both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MRD</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GBRD</ENAMEX> are heavily weighted toward euchromatic sequences.
          The amount of data scanned was significantly less than
          the total amount of nucleotide sequence contained in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MRD</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GBRD</ENAMEX>. Much of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MRD</ENAMEX> (~<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">36%</NUMEX>) is composed of
          contigs that are less than <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 kb long</NUMEX> and are therefore
          of limited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">LTR</ENAMEX>_STRUC program, which finds
          only full-length elements (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rice</ENAMEX> 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gypsy</ENAMEX> -like <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">elements</ENAMEX> are typically
          longer <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">than 10 kb</TIMEX> and are not entirely contained in such
          short contigs). In the case of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GBRD</ENAMEX>, the amount of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">rice</ENAMEX> nucleotide sequence available for search was less
          than <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one-third</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">174 Mb</ENAMEX> released to the public
          (because of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15%</NUMEX> redundancy, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GBRD</ENAMEX> sequences amounted
          to a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only about 150</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mb</ENAMEX>, of which only <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 50</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mb</ENAMEX>
          were actually available for BLAST search because most of
          these sequences were in the process of being 'finished').
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT</ENAMEX> sequences were identified according to previously
          described criteria [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31, 32</TIMEX>].
        
        
          Multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic

          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT</ENAMEX> domains of the

          previously reported <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT</ENAMEX> sequences (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). The ClustalW
          analysis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX>] extension to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">MacVector 7.0</NUMEX> was used to
          generate <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> amino<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">-acid alignments</ENAMEX>, one for 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">gypsy</ENAMEX> -like, and one for 
          copia -like elements. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Draw N-J Tree</ENAMEX>
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Bootstrap N-J commands of ClustalW</ENAMEX> were then used to
          generate non-bootstrapped and bootstrapped <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">trees</ENAMEX>,
          respectively.
