        Mortality prediction systems have been advocated as
        means of evaluating the performance of intensive care units
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICUs</ENAMEX>) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX>]. These systems allow adjustment to the severity
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> of the patient <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. Acute Physiology and
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chronic Health Evaluation</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">APACHE) II</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simplified Acute</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Physiology Score</ENAMEX> (SAPS) II measure severity of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> by a
        numeric score [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2, 3</ENAMEX>] based on physiologic variables
        selected because of their impact on mortality: the sicker
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patient</ENAMEX>, the more deranged the values and the higher
        the score. The numeric scores are then converted into
        predicted mortality by using a logistic regression formula
        developed and validated on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">populations</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICU</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mortality Probability Models</ENAMEX> (MPM) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">II</ENAMEX> differ slightly in
        that they use categorical variables (with the exception of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">age</ENAMEX>) for mortality prediction [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>].
        Before the clinical application of any of these systems,
        they must be validated on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> under evaluation [
        <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5, 6</ENAMEX>]. These <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">systems</ENAMEX> have been assessed for validity in
        several <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">countries</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7, 8, 9</ENAMEX>]. We report here the result of
        our validation study of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> systems in ICU population
        in a tertiary care <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Methods
        King <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fahad National Guard Hospital</ENAMEX> is a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">550</NUMEX>-bed tertiary
        care <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Riyadh</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX>-bed
        medical-surgical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICU</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">600</NUMEX> admissions <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</TIMEX>. The
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hospital</ENAMEX> also has a coronary care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> and a cardiac
        surgical intensive care <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> admitted to these
        units were not included in the study. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> is run by
        full-time intensivists and has <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24-hour</TIMEX> immediate access to
        other medical and surgical specialties. Our
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">nurse</ENAMEX>-to-patient ratio is <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">approximately 1:1.2</TIMEX>. This high
        ratio has been maintained because of the high acuity of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">care</ENAMEX>. Our ICU database was established in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 1999</TIMEX> to
        record ICU admissions. The present study presents
        information on all consecutive admissions <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">March</ENAMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999 and 31 December 2000</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> were collected by one of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">inten-sivists</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Y.A., S.H. or R.G.</ENAMEX>). To minimize
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variability</ENAMEX> in data collection, one <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physician</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Y.A.</ENAMEX>)
        coordinated the overall process. In addition, a written
        reference with the definitions used in original articles
        was made. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">aged 16 years</TIMEX> or more were eligible for
        the study with the exception of burn and brain-dead
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. For <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> admitted to the ICU more than once
        in the same hospitalization, data from the first admission
        were used. Approval from the hospital <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ethics Committee</ENAMEX> was
        not required because the information had already been
        collected for clinical reasons.
        The following data were collected: demographics, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APACHE</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SAPS II</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scores</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MPM</ENAMEX> variables. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MPM</ENAMEX> II 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">0</ENAMEX> data were obtained on all admissions,
        whereas <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MPM</ENAMEX> II 
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">APACHE II</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SAPS II</ENAMEX> data were
        obtained on <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> who stayed for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 hours</TIMEX> or more in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICU</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">APACHE II</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAPS</ENAMEX> II scores were calculated in
        accordance with the original methodology, using the worst
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">physiologic</ENAMEX> values in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> ICU day [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2, 3</ENAMEX>]. The only
        exception was <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Glasgow Coma Score</ENAMEX> (GCS). Many of these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> were under the influence of sedation and the worst
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GCS</ENAMEX> would reflect the effect of sedation more than the true
        underlying mental status. We therefore used the worst GCS
        value for non-sedated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and the pre-sedation score
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> under sedation, as described previously [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4,</ENAMEX>
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10, 11, 12</TIMEX>]. The main reason for ICU admission, whether the
        admission was after emergency surgery, and the presence of
        severe chronic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> were documented in accordance with
        the original definitions [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>]. Postoperative <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">sepsis</ENAMEX> or cardiac arrest were included with non-operative
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with these conditions [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2</ENAMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICU</ENAMEX> and hospital
        length of stay (<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">LOS</ENAMEX>) and lead time (the interval from
        hospital admission to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICU</ENAMEX> admission) were calculated. Vital
        status at discharge from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICU</ENAMEX> and from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> was
        registered.
        Predicted hospital mortality was calculated with the
        logistic regression formulas described originally [ <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2, 3,</ENAMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>]. Standardized mortality ratio (SMR) was calculated by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">dividing</ENAMEX> observed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> mortality by the predicted
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hospital</ENAMEX> mortality. The <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> confidence intervals (CIs) for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMRs</ENAMEX> were calculated by regarding the observed mortality as
        a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Poisson</ENAMEX> variable, then dividing its <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CI</ENAMEX> by the
        predicted mortality [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX>].
        Validation of the systems was tested by assessing
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">calibration</ENAMEX> and discrimination. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Calibration</ENAMEX> (the ability to
        provide risk estimate corresponding to the observed
        mortality) was assessed by calibration curves and the
        Lemeshow-Hosmer goodness-of-fit 
        C -statistic [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX>]. Calibration
        curves were drawn by plotting predicted against actual
        mortality for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of the patient <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> stratified
        by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> increments of predicted mortality. To calculate the 
        C -statistic, the study population
        was stratified into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> deciles with approximately equal
        numbers of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. The predicted and actual number of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">survivors</ENAMEX> and non-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">survivors</ENAMEX> were compared statistically
        with the use of formal goodness-of-fit testing to determine
        whether or not the discrepancy was statistically
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">insignificant</ENAMEX> ( 
        P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">> 0.05</NUMEX>).
        Discrimination was tested by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">receiver</ENAMEX> operating
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">characteristic</ENAMEX> (ROC) curves and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">2 Ã— 2</ENAMEX> classification
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">matrices</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ROC</ENAMEX> curves were constructed as a measure of
        assessing discrimination with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX> stepwise increments in
        predicted mortality [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14, 15</TIMEX>]. The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">curves</ENAMEX> were
        compared by computing the areas under the curves.
        Classification matrices were performed at decision criteria
        of <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10%</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30% and 50%</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sensitivity</ENAMEX>, specificity, positive and
        negative predictive values and overall correct
        classification rate were calculated.
        Minitab for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Windows</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Release 12.1</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Minitab Inc.</ENAMEX>) was
        used to perform statistics. Continuous variables were
        expressed as means Â± <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SD</ENAMEX> and were compared by standard 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">t</ENAMEX> -test. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Categorical</ENAMEX> values were
        expressed in absolute and relative frequencies and were
        analyzed by Ï‡ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2test</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Linear</ENAMEX> regression and logistic
        regression analysis were used when appropriate. 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P â‰¤ 0.05</ENAMEX> was considered
        significant.
      
      
        Results
        
          Patient population
          The demographics of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">969</NUMEX> eligible <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> are
          shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>. It is noteworthy that <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">32%</NUMEX> of all
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> had one or more severe chronic illnesses. Severe
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">hepatic disease</ENAMEX> was the leading chronic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX>, followed
          by immunosuppression, severe respiratory <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX>, renal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> and cardiovascular <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX>. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> had
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</NUMEX> severe chronic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX>. In comparison with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">survivors</ENAMEX>, non-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">survivors</ENAMEX> were older, had a longer lead
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICU LOS</ENAMEX> but shorter hospital <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">LOS</ENAMEX>. They had
          higher <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">APACHE II</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SAPS II</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">scores</ENAMEX>. The type of
          admission was more likely to be medical or emergency
          surgical in non-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">survivors</ENAMEX>, and to be elective surgical in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">survivors</ENAMEX>. Severe chronic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> was more common in
          non-<ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">survivors</ENAMEX>, especially liver disease.
        
        
          Mortality predicted by the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> systems
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2shows</ENAMEX> the actual mortality and predicted
          mortality by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all four</NUMEX> systems, and also SMRs and their
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIs</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMRs</ENAMEX> for all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">system</ENAMEX> were not significantly
          different from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, indicating accurate overall mortality
          prediction.
        
        
          Predicted mortality by <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subgroups</ENAMEX>
          When subgrouped by categories of main reasons for ICU
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">admission</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMRs</ENAMEX> by the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> systems were not
          significantly different from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, with few exceptions. MPM
          II 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MPM</ENAMEX> II 
          <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">24 overestimated</TIMEX> mortality for the
          category 'non-operative trauma' admissions, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAPS</ENAMEX> II
          underestimated mortality for the category 'other
          medical'. When subgrouped by the source of admission, all
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMRs</ENAMEX> were not significantly different from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> with the
          exception of the underestimation of mortality of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAPS</ENAMEX> II
          for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> admitted from the floor.
        
        
          Calibration
          Calibration curves are shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. Of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAPS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> stands out as deviating from the
          identity line in most of the strata, including those with
          large numbers of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">SAPS II</ENAMEX> curve shows an
          underestimation of mortality in low-risk <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> and an
          overestimation of mortality in high-risk <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>,
          leading to the skewed appearance of its calibration
          curve. The curves of the other <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> systems fell on the
          identity line in the strata with large number of patients
          and deviated in some other strata.
          The results of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lemeshow</ENAMEX>-Hosmer goodness-of-fit tests
          are shown in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>. The 
          C -statistic was best for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MPM</ENAMEX> II 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">14.71</NUMEX>), with 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.06</NUMEX>. For the other three
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">calibration</ENAMEX> tested by the 
          C -statistic was poor. These
          results indicate that, of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> systems, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MPM</ENAMEX> II 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> had the least statistically
          significant discrepancy between predicted and observed
          mortality across the strata of increasing predicted
          mortality.
        
        
          Discrimination
          Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2shows</NUMEX> the receiver operating characteristic
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ROC</ENAMEX>) curves for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> systems. The corresponding
          <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">areas</ENAMEX> under the curves were as follows: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MPM</ENAMEX> II 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.85</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MPM</ENAMEX> II 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.84</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">APACHE II</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.83</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SAPS II</ENAMEX>,
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.79</NUMEX>. These reflect the better discriminative power of
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> systems than that of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">SAPS</ENAMEX> II.
          The results of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2Ã—2</NUMEX> classification matrix are shown
          in <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 5</ENAMEX>. The overall correct classification rate was
          highest for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MPM</ENAMEX> II 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> and lowest for <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">SAPS II</ENAMEX> at the
          different cutoff points; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MPM</ENAMEX> II 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">APACHE II</ENAMEX> had intermediate
          rates. This was consistent with the results of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ROC</ENAMEX> curve
          testing.
        
        
          Correlation of predicted mortalities by the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
          systems
          On the basis of linear regression analysis,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mortalities</ENAMEX> predicted by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all four</NUMEX> systems correlated with
          each other ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 0.001</ENAMEX> for all combinations).
          The closest correlation was between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MPM</ENAMEX> II 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MPM</ENAMEX> II 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ( 
          r <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.67</NUMEX>) followed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">APACHE</ENAMEX> II
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAPS</ENAMEX> II 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ( 
          r <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.66</NUMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MPM</ENAMEX> II 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SAPS II</ENAMEX> ( 
          r <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.62</NUMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MPM</ENAMEX> II 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">APACHE II</ENAMEX> ( 
          r <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.56</NUMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MPM</ENAMEX> II 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SAPS II</ENAMEX> ( 
          r <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.52</NUMEX>) and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MPM</ENAMEX> II 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">APACHE II</ENAMEX> ( 
          r <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.48</NUMEX>). Figure 3shows plots for
          the highest and lowest correlations.
        
        
          The effect of lead time and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICU LOS</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX>
          mortality
          By univariate analysis, lead time was a significant
          predictor of hospital outcome (odds ratio <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.02</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> CI
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.00</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.03</NUMEX> per day, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.04</NUMEX>). However, when adjusted
          to the severity of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> estimated from the mortality
          predicted by any of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> systems, lead time was not
          an independent predictor of hospital outcome. Similarly,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICU LOS</ENAMEX> was a significant predictor of hospital outcome
          by univariate analysis (odds ratio <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.02</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX> CI <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.00</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.03</NUMEX>
          per day, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.01</NUMEX>) but not when adjusted to
          severity of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> by multivariate analysis.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        The main findings of this validation study on a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saudi</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arabian ICU</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> can be summarized as follows: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>)
        overall mortality prediction, estimated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMR</ENAMEX>, was
        reasonably accurate, especially for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MPM</ENAMEX> II 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">APACHE II</ENAMEX>; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MPM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II24</ENAMEX> had the
        best calibration by 
        C -statistic; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">SAPS II</ENAMEX> had the
        lowest calibration and discrimination.
        There is great international variability in patient mix
        and severity of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7, 8, 9, 16</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17, 18</TIMEX>]. Some of the
        differences are inherent in the patient <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX>. For
        example, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with cirrhosis have a high severity of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> and poor prognosis when admitted to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICU</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19</TIMEX>,
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20, 21</TIMEX>]. Case mix is also affected by the type of hospital,
        for example whether it is primary or tertiary, or a
        transplant or trauma <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Patients</ENAMEX> referred from other
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX> have a higher severity of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> and mortality
        compared with direct admissions [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX>]. Other factors are
        practice-related. An important example is the 'do
        not-resuscitate' (DNR) practice [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23, 24</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Early</ENAMEX> (pre-ICU)
        determination of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">DNR</ENAMEX> status reduces the number of futile
        admissions to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICU</ENAMEX> leading to a probable reduction in
        overall severity of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX>. Another example is related to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">ICU</ENAMEX> bed availability. It has been documented that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> tend to be more selective in their ICU
        admissions at times of bed shortages, with <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> with
        higher severity of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> being admitted [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX>]. In our
        study, the relatively high level of severity of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> was
        probably related to a combination of all these factors.
        Being a tertiary care <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> receives
        referrals from other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospitals</ENAMEX>, some of them directly to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICU</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). Being a transplant <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX>, we have a large
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> of end-stage liver disease. The concept of DNR
        is evolving in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX>. Our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">hospital</ENAMEX> has been leading
        in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">country</ENAMEX> in this field by establishing a written
        policy for DNR orders and raising the awareness among
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">physicians</ENAMEX> about this issue. Nevertheless, there is room
        for improvement. Frequently the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">DNR</ENAMEX> status is discussed at
        a very late stage or is not discussed at all before
        admission to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICU</ENAMEX>. Consequently, many desperately ill
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> are admitted to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICU</ENAMEX> with very high severity of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> and no meaningful chance of survival. The nursing
        shortage in our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICU</ENAMEX> led to selecting the sicker admissions
        and decreasing the number of elective admissions.
        In this study we showed that the overall mortality
        prediction was accurate but calibration was inadequate.
        Potential reasons for insufficient calibration might
        include the following: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) factors related to the
        calibration methodology itself; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) reasons related to data
        collection, namely <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intra-observer</ENAMEX> and interobserver
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">variability</ENAMEX>; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) variability in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GCS</ENAMEX>; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>) differences in
        case mix; (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">5</ENAMEX>) differences in DNR policies; and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6</ENAMEX>)
        differences in medical care.
        The results of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lemeshow-Hosmer</ENAMEX> statistics are dependent
        not only on the calibration of the model but also on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">patient</ENAMEX> numbers and the distribution of the estimates [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</NUMEX>]. The results of the calibration tests in our study
        might seem inconsistent with the overall estimate of
        mortality of the whole <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> and with the mortality
        estimates of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subgroups</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). This apparent
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">inconsistency</ENAMEX> is probably related to the distribution of
        estimates. The overestimation of mortality in certain
        strata of severity of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> is 'counterbalanced' by
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">underestimation</ENAMEX> in other strata (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>), leading to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">'perfect</ENAMEX>' estimation when the whole <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">population</ENAMEX> or a
        specific subgroup is considered.
        Interobserver variability in data collection has been
        documented in several studies [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">27, 28, 29</TIMEX>]. This is
        potentially relevant to our study because data collection
        was performed by several <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">physicians</ENAMEX> and over a relatively
        long period (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22 months</TIMEX>). We tried to minimize variability
        by having a written reference of definitions based on the
        original articles of the various scoring systems and having
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">person</ENAMEX> coordinate the process of data collection.
        Similar approaches have been shown to minimize variability
        [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30, 31</TIMEX>]. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MPM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">systems</ENAMEX> have been documented to have high
        reproducibility, which might explain the better calibration
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MPM</ENAMEX> II 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> in our study [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX>].
        The variability of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GCS</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">determination</ENAMEX> in sedated patients
        accounts for much of the variability in scoring <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">APACHE</ENAMEX> II.
        Several approaches in determining <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GCS</ENAMEX> have been used
        previously. For non-sedated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> we used the worst
        value in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the first 24 hours</TIMEX>; for sedated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> we used
        the pre-sedation <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GCS</ENAMEX>. This approach has been shown to be
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with better performance of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">APACHE II</ENAMEX> than the
        approach that assumes normal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GCS</ENAMEX> for sedated <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>]. This approach also follows the original <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MPM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> article
        definitions [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX>] and is consistent with the approach
        described by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Knaus</ENAMEX> and others [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11, 12</TIMEX>].
        Another potential reason for the inadequate calibration
        is the differences in case mix between our database and the
        development databases of the mortality prediction systems.
        Medical <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX> constitute a larger proportion in our
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">database</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">68%</NUMEX>) than in the development databases (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MPM</ENAMEX> II 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">45%</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MPM</ENAMEX> II 
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> , <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">48%</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SAPS II</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">49%</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">APACHE II</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">58%</NUMEX>)
        [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2, 3, 4</ENAMEX>]. When the main diagnostic categories in our
        database are compared with those in the development
        database <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">of APACHE II</ENAMEX>, some interesting differences appear.
        The post cardiac arrest category, which is associated with
        a high mortality risk (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">APACHE II</ENAMEX> diagnostic category weight
        is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.393</NUMEX>) accounts for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7%</NUMEX> of our admissions, compared with
        <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3%</NUMEX> in the developmental database of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">APACHE</ENAMEX> II. The
        postoperative category 'peripheral vascular surgery', which
        is associated with a low mortality risk (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">APACHE II</ENAMEX>
        diagnostic weight is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-1.315</NUMEX>) accounts for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.5%</NUMEX> of our
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">admissions</ENAMEX>, compared with <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9.82%</NUMEX> of the development
        database. Our database also has more severe chronic
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">illnesses</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">32%</NUMEX>) compared with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">29%</NUMEX> in different
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">participating ICUs</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">APACHE II</ENAMEX> development database.
        This is partly related to the high percentage of patients
        with end-stage liver disease admitted to our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICU</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12.5%</NUMEX> of
        all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">patients</ENAMEX>).
        Differences in admission practises to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ICUs</ENAMEX> might
        also have an impact on ICU outcome. The delay in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DNR</ENAMEX> orders
        is mentioned <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX>. This factor probably contributes to
        our high severity of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX> and could have affected system
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">calibration</ENAMEX>.
        Finally, one must examine whether the inadequate
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">calibration</ENAMEX> is related to differences in medical care.
        However, in our study, overall actual mortality was not
        different from predicted mortality, as is evident in the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SMRs</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). Furthermore, when the calibration curves
        are examined there is no consistent pattern of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">overestimation</ENAMEX> or underestimation of mortality among the
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> systems in the different strata of severity of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">illness</ENAMEX>. This suggests that the inadequate calibration is
        inherent in these systems when applied to this population
        and less likely to be related to gross variation in medical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">care</ENAMEX>.
        Our study has some limitations. First, it is a
        single-center study, which makes it biased towards a
        certain case mix. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, as discussed above, collecting
        the data over a relatively long period by different
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">physicians</ENAMEX> has implications for consistency of data
        collection. The use of a written reference of definitions
        and assigning a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">coordinator</ENAMEX> to oversee the whole process
        probably decreased variability, as has been shown
        previously [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28, 29</TIMEX>]. In addition, variability has been
        found to be random and of little impact on the overall
        estimates [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX>]. A multicenter study would have addressed
        some of these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">concerns</ENAMEX>.
        In conclusion, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> mortality prediction systems
        gave accurate overall estimates of mortality, especially
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MPM</ENAMEX> II 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">APACHE</ENAMEX> II. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Calibration</ENAMEX> was modest
        for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MPM</ENAMEX> II 
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> and inadequate for the others. SAPS
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">II</ENAMEX> had the lowest calibration and discrimination. The local
        performance of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MPM</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">II</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">systems</ENAMEX> (particularly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MPM</ENAMEX> II 
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> ), in addition to their ease of use,
        makes them attractive models for use in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX>.
        However, a multi-center national study is needed to confirm
        these findings.
