        Fungal pathogens can be important selective <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">forces</ENAMEX> on
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> in habitats favorable to fungal development, but
        estimating the magnitude of selection by fungal pathogens
        in nature is difficult. The development of fungal disease
        in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least three</NUMEX> important control points: the
        prevalence of fungal inoculum, the environment during
        infection, and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> development as modified by plant
        defenses [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2</NUMEX> ] . Most field studies on wild <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> have
        not measured pathogen abundance but have focused on disease
        expression [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4 5 6</NUMEX> ] . Atmospheric moisture is generally
        the single most important environmental factor influencing
        the incidence and severity of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">fungal diseases</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8 9 10</NUMEX> ] . High relative humidity and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">several hours</TIMEX> of
        free surface <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> are critical for both spore germination
        and successful infection [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12 13</NUMEX> ] . In addition,
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">infection</ENAMEX> (i.e., invasion of plant tissue by the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">fungus</ENAMEX>)
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> (i.e., the expression of symptoms such as
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> or necrosis) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> due to air-borne
        fungi are favored by temperatures of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15-40°C</TIMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 15</NUMEX> ] .
        Field studies on plant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pathogens</ENAMEX> have demonstrated that the
        growth of fungi is favored by high moisture and moderate
        temperatures [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 15 16 17 18</NUMEX> ] and that low relative
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">humidity</ENAMEX> and extreme temperatures inhibit growth and spore
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">germination</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 19</NUMEX> ] . Other studies on soil fungi also
        show that prevalence differs among habitats and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seasons</TIMEX> and
        correlates positively with moisture and negatively with
        temperature [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13 20</NUMEX> ] . This apparent positive relationship
        between moisture and fungal growth and abundance may result
        from the high surface-to-volume ratio of fungi, making them
        vulnerable to water loss.
        The positive association between habitat moisture and
        the incidence and severity of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> suggests that the
        selective pressures imposed on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> by pathogenic fungi
        may vary among habitats. However, the relationship of
        habitat characteristics to inoculum abundance, infection
        and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> is poorly understood. This study focuses on
        abiotic correlates of inoculum abundance. It is not an
        attempt to describe the distribution of particular species
        of fungi, but rather to obtain an independent predictor of
        the prevalence of fungal inoculi in different habitats. To
        do this, we examined fungi in the air and on leaf surfaces
        rather than trying to separate opportunistic and obligate
        pathogens from non-pathogens. First, it would be
        impractical to identify all fungi sampled, and <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> there
        is no reason to expect that pathogens and non-pathogens
        differ in their abiotic requirements for growth. The growth
        and sporulation of many pathogens is favored by high
        humidity, and temperature requirements are similar to other
        mesophiles, with ranges <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 5 and 50°C</TIMEX> and optima
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 20 and 30°C</TIMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1 12 13</ENAMEX> ] . Thus, characterizing the
        weather conditions favorable for fungi in general may be
        useful in predicting the extent of selection imposed by
        pathogenic fungi on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> in different habitats.
        In this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">paper</ENAMEX>, we report the relationship of fungal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">abundance</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species richness</ENAMEX> to abiotic factors such as
        weather, elevation, geographic location, and soil
        characteristics in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intermountain West</ENAMEX>. Although a
        geographically restricted area (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>), the Intermountain
        <ENAMEX TYPE="NATIONALITY">West</ENAMEX> encompasses a diverse array of habitats from desert to
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">alpine</ENAMEX> habitats. Our goal was to estimate habitat
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">favorability</ENAMEX> to fungi by relating weather and other
        environmental conditions to fungal abundance and richness.
        Given that the distribution and abundance of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> as a
        function of environment provides the fundamental basis of
        many ecological and evolutionary <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">disciplines</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] ,
        establishing a better understanding of fungal distributions
        in natural habitats is central to the study of mycology and
        plant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ecology</ENAMEX>.
      
      
        Results
        
          Fungal abundance and richness
          In order to estimate fungal abundance and richness of
          different habitats, we sampled fungi from the air and the
          leaf surfaces of the vegetation. We used <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> different
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">media</ENAMEX> in case fungi had different growth requirements
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">potato sucrose agar</ENAMEX>, casein agar and agar made with
          extracts of sagebrush leaves). For vegetation sampling,
          we found no effect of media type on fungal abundance
          (Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric analysis χ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.60</NUMEX>; 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.74</NUMEX>), or on fungal richness (χ
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3.50</NUMEX>; 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.17</NUMEX>). Therefore, for the
          vegetation sampling, we averaged data from the three
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">media</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">types</ENAMEX> to obtain one value for the abundance and
          richness at each site. For the air sampling in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX>, we
          found no effect of media type on fungal abundance (χ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.61</NUMEX>; 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.45</NUMEX>) or richness (χ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.73</NUMEX>; 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.69</NUMEX>), so we averaged data from
          the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> media <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">types</ENAMEX>. Lastly, for the air sampling in
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>, we averaged the data from the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> plates.
          Because <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> time sampling may not adequately estimate
          fungal abundance and richness in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">community</ENAMEX>, we
          combined the vegetation values and the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> air sample
          values to give <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> index of fungal abundance from each
          site and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> index of fungal richness from each site
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). To calculate this index, we standardized the
          values for the vegetation sample by dividing the value at
          each site by the mean for all sites. This gives an
          average index of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>. We repeated this procedure for the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> air samplings using their respective means. For each
          site, the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> vegetation and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> air <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> were
          averaged to obtain an index of fungal abundance. Fungal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">richness</ENAMEX> was calculated the same way. The resultant
          average fungal abundance positively correlates with the
          average fungal richness across sites (r = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.75</NUMEX>, 
          P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.0001</NUMEX>).
          We compared habitat differences for each of the fungal
          sampling techniques in question independently. For fungi
          sampled on vegetation, field <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites differed</ENAMEX> in fungal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">abundance</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kruskal-Wallis</ENAMEX> nonparametric analysis χ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">127.33</NUMEX>; 
          P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.0001</NUMEX>) and richness (χ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>

          P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.0001</NUMEX>). For samples from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">air</ENAMEX>, field <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites differed</ENAMEX> in fungal abundance (χ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>

          P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.005</NUMEX>) in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX> and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">fungal abundance χ 2</ENAMEX> 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">129.37.87</NUMEX>; 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 0.0001</ENAMEX> and richness χ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> 
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">130.86</NUMEX>; 
          P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.0001</NUMEX>). Fungal measures
          obtained from vegetation and air sampling in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX> were
          not correlated (abundance, r = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.17</NUMEX>, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.49</NUMEX>; richness, r = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.10</NUMEX>, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.69</NUMEX>). Fungal abundance in air
          was positively correlated between <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> (r = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.81</NUMEX>, 
          P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.0007</NUMEX>), but this
          relationship was not significant for fungal richness (r =
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.40</NUMEX>, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.18</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Weather
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Two years</TIMEX> of data (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998 and 1999</TIMEX>) were compared for
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX>, and weather patterns were similar between
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> (data not shown). The weather within the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> field
          sites with duplicate dataloggers had no detectable
          within<NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">-</NUMEX>site differences (data not shown). Conversely, the
          weather across field sites had a broad range of
          temperatures and moisture regimes (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>). With the
          exception of the seasonal maximum and minimum relative
          humidity, all weather variables differed considerably
          among sites. The average temperature for the growing
          season ranged from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5.6°C</TIMEX> to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21.8°C</TIMEX>. The average relative
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">humidity</ENAMEX> ranged from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30% to 72%</NUMEX>, and the average diurnal
          maximum in relative humidity ranged from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40% to 97%</NUMEX>. The
          duration of unfavorable periods, expressed by the average
          number of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">consecutive days</TIMEX> with maximum diurnal relative
          humidity <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 50%</NUMEX>, ranged from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">0 to 11.0 days</TIMEX>. While
          relative humidity is a measure of available moisture in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">air</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VPD</ENAMEX> is an absolute measure of the moisture
          deficit of air. Therefore, temperature has a negative
          effect on relative humidity and a positive effect on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VPD</ENAMEX>.
          During the growing season, the average VPD ranged from
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.53</NUMEX> kPa at the hottest site (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gunlock</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21.8°C</TIMEX>) to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.56</NUMEX>
          kPa at the coolest site (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Racetrack</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5.6°C</TIMEX>). Sites with a
          high VPD had a higher variance in VPD than sites with low
          values of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VPD</ENAMEX>; the standard deviation in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VPD</ENAMEX> explained
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">45%</NUMEX> of the variance in average VPD ( 
          P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.002</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Relationships of fungal abundance and richness with
          weather variables
          Fungal abundance and richness of the field <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> were
          related to many of the weather variables; however, single
          weather parameters averaged over <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the season</TIMEX>, such as
          temperature or moisture, generally explained less
          variance than composite weather variables such as the
          average number of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">consecutive days</TIMEX> with a maximum diurnal
          relative humidity <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 50%</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). Temperature
          was negatively related to fungal richness (r <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.26</NUMEX>, 
          P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>), but not to fungal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">abundance</ENAMEX>. The relationships of the average relative
          humidity of the growing season with fungal abundance (r
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.30</NUMEX>, 
          P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>) and richness (r <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>=
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.35</NUMEX>, 
          P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.01</NUMEX>) were stronger than the
          relationships with temperature. An even stronger negative
          relationship was observed with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VPD</ENAMEX> and fungal abundance
          (r <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.30</NUMEX>, 
          P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>) and richness (r <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>=
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.44</NUMEX>, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.01</NUMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
          A greater proportion of the variance in fungal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">abundance</ENAMEX> and richness was explained by the proportion of
          time conditions were favorable for growth (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). The
          favorability indices were the proportion of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> and the
          average number of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">consecutive days</TIMEX> with temperature
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 4 and 40°C</TIMEX> plus a maximum relative humidity
          greater than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90%</NUMEX>. Both measures were positively related
          to fungal abundance (r <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.41</NUMEX>, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.01</NUMEX>; r <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.21</NUMEX>, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 0.05</ENAMEX>, respectively) and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">richness</ENAMEX> (r <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.54</NUMEX>, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.001</NUMEX>; r <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.12</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">n.s.</ENAMEX>,
          respectively). Variables based on maximum diurnal
          relative humidity <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">greater than 90%</NUMEX> consistently had
          stronger relationships than variables based on relative
          humidity <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">greater than 75%</NUMEX> (data not shown).
          Measures of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">unfavorability</ENAMEX> explained even more of the
          variation in fungal abundance and richness among <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX>.
          Both the proportion of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> and the average number of
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">consecutive days</TIMEX> with maximum diurnal relative humidity
          less than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> were negatively related to fungal abundance
          (r <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.43</NUMEX>, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.01</NUMEX>; r <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.56</NUMEX>,

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.001</NUMEX>; r <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.72</NUMEX>, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 0.001</ENAMEX>, respectively). In
          fact, the average number of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">consecutive days</TIMEX> with a
          maximum diurnal relative humidity <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 50%</NUMEX> was the
          best climatic predictor of fungal abundance and richness
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). Most weather variables were highly
          correlated with each other, so combining variables
          through stepwise multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regression</ENAMEX> explained no more of
          the variance in fungal abundance and richness than did
          the average number of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">consecutive days</TIMEX> with relative
          humidity <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 50%</NUMEX>.
        
        
          Weather stations
          Fungal abundance and richness, when regressed against
          climate records from nearby weather <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stations</ENAMEX>, displayed a
          positive relationship with precipitation (abundance, r <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>=
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.21</NUMEX>, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX>; richness, r <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.14</NUMEX>,

          P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.001</NUMEX>). The trend for fungi
          to be less abundant and diverse as temperatures increase

          obtained from the direct weather measurements (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>

          Geographic pattern
          The fungal abundance and richness of the habitats has
          a geographic and elevational pattern (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). Fungal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">abundance</ENAMEX> and richness were positively related to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">latitude</ENAMEX> (r <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.22</NUMEX>, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">P</ENAMEX> < <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</NUMEX>; r <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.35</NUMEX>, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 0.01</ENAMEX>, respectively) and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">elevation</ENAMEX> (r <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.09</NUMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">n.s.</ENAMEX>; r <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.18</NUMEX>, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">P < 0.05</ENAMEX>, respectively). A
          negative relationship was found between fungal richness
          and longitude (r <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.17</NUMEX>, 
          P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>), but this relationship
          was not significant for fungal abundance (r <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.03</NUMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">n.</ENAMEX>s).
        
        
          Site-specific factors
          There was a positive relationship between the presence
          of streams or lakes at a site and fungal abundance (r <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>=
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.26</NUMEX>, 
          P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.01</NUMEX>) and richness (r <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>=
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.16</NUMEX>, 
          P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.05</NUMEX>). However, the presence
          of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> at a site was not related to the average
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">temperature</ENAMEX> (r <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.15</NUMEX>, 
          P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.10</NUMEX>) or the relative
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">humidity</ENAMEX> (r <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.15</NUMEX>, 
          P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.10</NUMEX>) of the site. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> vegetation indicative of moisture also
          explained a significant portion of the variance in fungal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">abundance</ENAMEX> (r <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.49</NUMEX>, 
          P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.001</NUMEX>) and richness (r <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>=
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.40</NUMEX>, 
          P <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">< 0.001</NUMEX>).
        
        
          Soil
          We found no significant correlation between soil
          properties and fungal abundance and richness (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">%</NUMEX> organic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon</ENAMEX> in soil, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">%</NUMEX> nitrogen in soil, pH of soil, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">% sand</ENAMEX> in
          soil, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">%</NUMEX> silt in soil, or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">%</NUMEX> clay in soil). However, we
          noted trends for fungal abundance and richness to be
          positively related to soil organic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon</ENAMEX>, nitrogen,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">clay</ENAMEX>, and silt and negatively related to soil <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">pH</ENAMEX> and
          sand.
        
      
      
        Discussion
        
          Abiotic predictors of fungal prevalence
          Fungal abundance and richness were clearly affected by
          weather, showing large differences among habitats.
          Weather parameters differed considerably in the amount of
          variance they explained in the fungal abundance and
          richness of the habitat. As demonstrated by previous
          studies, both temperature and moisture were important in
          explaining the fungal abundance and richness of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">habitats</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">All three</NUMEX> of the humidity variables averaged
          over the growing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VPD</ENAMEX>, relative humidity, and the
          average maximum diurnal relative humidity) were highly
          positively related to both measures of fungal prevalence
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). These data are consistent with studies of crop
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX> that suggest dew duration, relative humidity and
          temperature are critical parameters for predicting the
          extent of disease [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22 23 24 25 26 27</NUMEX> ] . Of the three
          humidity measures in our study, the average maximum
          diurnal relative humidity was the best predictor,
          explaining <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">43% and 65%</NUMEX> of the variance in fungal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">abundance</ENAMEX> and richness, respectively. Because most
          mesophilic fungi fail to grow at <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 96%</NUMEX> humidity [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</NUMEX> ] , it is not surprising that the maximum relative
          humidity was a better predictor of fungal prevalence than
          the average.
          Because extreme temperatures below freezing and above
          40°C likely impede the growth of most mesophilic fungi
          regardless of moisture conditions [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 15</NUMEX> ] , one might
          predict that the length of the growing season would be
          positively correlated with fungal abundance. However, in
          our study, we found that fungal abundance and richness
          decreased as the number of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">consecutive days</TIMEX> without
          freezing increased. Furthermore, there was a weak
          negative relationship between fungal abundance and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">richness</ENAMEX> and average temperature. These negative
          relationships may result from the fact that our field
          sites with a longer growing season are hotter and drier
          than sites with a shorter growing season.
          Although direct weather measurements almost always
          explained more of the variance (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>), data on
          temperature and precipitation obtained from weather
          stations were significantly related to fungal abundance
          and richness and had similar trends as data obtained in
          the habitat. Hence, in the absence of direct weather
          measures, weather station data may be of value in
          predicting fungal abundance and diversity [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> ] .
        
        
          Proportion and duration of favorable or unfavorable
          days
          All weather variables expressing the proportion of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> with favorable conditions in a habitat (high
          relative humidity with moderate temperatures) had a
          positive relationship with fungal abundance and richness
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). Although previous work has emphasized using
          favorable conditions to explain fungal distribution [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> ] in our study, the parameter that explained the
          greatest amount of variance was an index of unfavorable
          conditions, the average number of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">consecutive days</TIMEX> with
          maximum relative humidity <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 50%</NUMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>). It is
          not entirely clear why unfavorability was such a strong
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">predictor</ENAMEX>, as most spores are probably capable of
          surviving these conditions although fungi might not be
          able to sporulate, germinate or grow [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1 12</ENAMEX> ] .
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Habitat and Geographic</ENAMEX> patterns
          The abundance and richness of fungi were related to
          the presence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> in a habitat and to vegetation
          indicative of moisture (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). Drier habitats
          generally have less vegetation than do moister, cooler
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">habitats</ENAMEX>, and plant biomass has been shown to accurately
          predict the microbial biomass of the soil [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">28</TIMEX> ] . These
          observations indicate that the plant <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">community</ENAMEX> may be a
          good predictor of fungal abundance and richness.
          The geographic trend in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Utah</ENAMEX> of fewer fungi with
          decreasing latitude and increasing longitude may be
          explained by more arid weather towards the south and west
          than towards the north and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">east</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Western</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eastern Utah</ENAMEX> are divided by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> biogeographic provinces
          that differ in precipitation patterns [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] . Western
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Utah</ENAMEX> is part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Great Basin</ENAMEX>, which receives the
          majority of precipitation during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the winter months</TIMEX> when
          most fungi may be dormant. Conversely, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Eastern Utah</ENAMEX> is
          part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colorado</ENAMEX> plateau and receives a substantial
          amount of precipitation during the growing season.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        Our data indicate that microclimate strongly influences
        the abundance and diversity of fungi in the Intermountain
        <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West</ENAMEX>. Even though both measures of fungal prevalence were
        strongly correlated across habitats, we propose that fungal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">richness</ENAMEX> is a better indicator of habitats favorable to
        most fungi than is fungal abundance. In other words, a high
        fungal richness may be a superior indicator that conditions
        of the habitat are broadly favorable to fungi. Because a
        few <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> may produce abundant spores during periodic
        conditions of high moisture and moderate temperatures,
        sporadic sporulation events may affect fungal abundance
        measurements and overestimate the habitat favorability to
        most fungi.
        A surprisingly large proportion of the variation among
        sites in fungal richness was explained by the proportion of
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> with favorable conditions of temperature and high
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">humidity</ENAMEX> (r <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.54</NUMEX>). The number of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> with unfavorable
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">periods</TIMEX> was an even better predictor (r <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2</TIMEX>= <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.72</NUMEX>). Because
        fungal pathogens appear to have similar abiotic
        requirements for growth as most fungi [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1 13 15 16</ENAMEX> ] , it
        is likely that fungal pathogens would show correlations
        with climate that parallel those reported in this study.
        This suggests that moister habitats will have a greater
        inoculum potential from pathogenic fungi than drier
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">habitats</ENAMEX>. An elevated inoculum by pathogens could be
        largely responsible for the increased incidence of fungal
        disease documented in moister habitats. We would also
        predict that a high prevalence of pathogens would select
        for greater levels of anti-fungal defense by plant species
        adapted to moist habitats. Thus, weather factors identified
        in this study as being important predictors of fungal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">abundance</ENAMEX> and diversity in general, may also shed light on
        the distribution of fungal pathogens and the extent of
        selection on plant defenses.
      
      
        Materials and Methods
        
          Study sites
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intermountain West</ENAMEX> is topographically and
          climatically diverse and provides many different habitats
          to study the relationship between weather and fungal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">abundance</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species richness</ENAMEX>. We selected <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> field
          sites (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 1</NUMEX> hectare in area) in and near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Utah</ENAMEX>
          that differ in factors that influence weather such as
          elevation, longitude and latitude, proximity to permanent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">water</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">sources</ENAMEX>, and topography. To eliminate comparing
          habitat extremes, all <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</NUMEX> field sites share a widely
          distributed species of shrub, sagebrush, 
          Artemisia tridentata (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asteraceae</ENAMEX>).
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Community types</ENAMEX> include arid grasslands with cacti,
          riparian <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX> characterized by cottonwoods, and
          subalpine areas with tall forbs and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">aspen stands</ENAMEX>.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Intermountain West</ENAMEX> consists of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> biogeographic
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">provinces</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Great Basin</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colorado Plateau</ENAMEX>, that
          differ in precipitation patterns and drainage [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ] .
          While both the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Great Basin</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colorado Plateau</ENAMEX> share
          weathers with cool wet <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winters</TIMEX> and relatively dry
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">summers</ENAMEX>, they differ in that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colorado Plateau</ENAMEX> has
          wetter <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summers</TIMEX> and drier <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">winters</TIMEX> than the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Great Basin</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">29</NUMEX> ] . There is also a trend for <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> to have lower
          total <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">rainfall</ENAMEX> towards the south and west.
        
        
          Fungal culturing
          Fungi were collected in the air and on the vegetation
          (see below) and were grown on plates containing growth
          medium. This method quantifies a portion of the viable
          propagules that are able to germinate and form visible
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">colonies</ENAMEX> in the time frame observed unlike visual counts
          of spores using a microscope. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</NUMEX> types of media

          used to grow fungi: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">potato dextrose agar</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] , (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>)

          except sucrose is used instead of dextrose; [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">31</TIMEX> ] , (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>)
          casein agar (for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1 L</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">5 g casein</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">g NaCl</ENAMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> g

          prepare the sagebrush-leaf agar, we removed surface
          secondary metabolites on <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">80 g</NUMEX> of fresh 
          A. tridentata leaves by washing
          them in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</NUMEX> ml of chloroform for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">three minutes and</TIMEX>
          washing again in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</NUMEX> ml of chloroform for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 minute</TIMEX>.
          Leaves were placed under a hood for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</TIMEX> to remove

          to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2 days</TIMEX>). We homogenized dried leaves in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">900</NUMEX> ml of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX> and then filtered the leaf extract (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Whatman #1</NUMEX>). We

          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ampicillin</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">60 μg/ ml</ENAMEX>) to eliminate contamination by

          commonly used to grow fungal pathogens. We used the
          leaves of 
          A. tridentata in a medium
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">sagebrush</NUMEX>-leaf agar) because this <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> is common to
          all habitats.
        
        
          Vegetation sampling
          During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September of 1998</TIMEX>, we measured fungal abundance
          and richness in each habitat by culturing fungi found on
          the vegetation in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">communities</ENAMEX>. Because some plants
          contain secondary metabolites on the leaf surface that
          inhibit fungal growth, we cultured fungi collected only
          from leaf surfaces of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> that were not aromatic
          when their leaf surfaces were rubbed. Using sterilized
          scissors, we collected <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> cm <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">2of leaf material</ENAMEX> from each
          of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> haphazardly chosen <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plants</ENAMEX> (from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three to five</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">species</ENAMEX>) and combined <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all seven</NUMEX> in a single sterile vial.
          This was repeated using the same <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">plants</ENAMEX>. Leaf samples
          were collected in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the late afternoon</TIMEX> and stored at 4°C
          for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">up to 7 days</TIMEX> before culturing. The relationship of
          diversity and abundance of culturable fungi with storage
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">time</ENAMEX> was not determined. To remove fungi from leaf
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">surfaces</ENAMEX>, we soaked and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vortexed leaf samples</ENAMEX> for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX>

          spread <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250</NUMEX> μl of the inoculated solution onto <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one 10</NUMEX>-cm
          Petri plates each of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">potato sucrose agar</ENAMEX>, casein agar,
          and sagebrush-leaf agar. Since we collected two
          vegetation <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> per site, there were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> plates of
          each of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">six plates per</NUMEX> site.
          We incubated the inoculated plates at room temperature
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">22°C</NUMEX>) for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4 days</TIMEX> before counting the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX>
          per plate as a measure of fungal abundance. We found
          little change in the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4 days</TIMEX>,
          presumably due to the proliferation of the aggressively
          growing fungi. We classified the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">colonies</ENAMEX> under a
          disecting microscope (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10 to 50×</NUMEX>) into morphotypes based
          upon <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">colony</ENAMEX> morphology (effuse, raised, domed or
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">umbonate</ENAMEX>), color, transparency, and shape (irregular,
          crenated, or rhiziod). We scored fungal richness as the
          total number of morphotypes per plate. We averaged fungal
          measures from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">vegetation samples</ENAMEX> for each of the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">media</ENAMEX>. We did not attempt to identify <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> or to
          compare morphotypes across plates. Although the different
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">media</ENAMEX> probably favor different fungal <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX>, our goal
          was not to measure habitat differences of specific fungi,
          but to estimate the overall fungal abundance and species
          richness of the habitats. Furthermore, the fungal
          measures likely represent the abundance and richness of
          mesophiles, because the temperature (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">22°C</NUMEX>) used to
          incubate inoculi falls within the temperature optima of
          mesophilic fungi.
        
        
          Air sampling
          During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September of 1998</TIMEX>, we collected air-borne fungi
          at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> by vertically swiping <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> agar plates (one
          each of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">potato sucrose agar</ENAMEX>, casein agar, and
          sagebrush-leaf agar) <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">ten</NUMEX> times in the air. During <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX>
          of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>, we collected air-borne fungi at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> by
          swiping <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">potato dextrose</ENAMEX> agar plates vertically <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX>
          times in the air. At each site the replicate plates were
          collected at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> haphazardly chosen locations to obtain an
          average measure of fungal abundance and richness of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">habitat</ENAMEX>. Samples were collected in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the late afternoon</TIMEX>. We
          incubated inoculated plates in a cooler at ambient
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">temperature</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">approximately 22°C</NUMEX>) for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4 days</TIMEX> and examined
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">plates</ENAMEX> in the field. Fungal abundance and richness were
          scored as above.
        
        
          Direct weather measurements
          We recorded the average temperature and relative
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humidity</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">every 30 minutes</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">19</NUMEX> of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25</TIMEX> study sites
          with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NOMAD</ENAMEX> dataloggers (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">OM-NOMAD-RH-32</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Omega</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Engineering, Inc</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Stamford</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CT</ENAMEX>) protected in a
          weatherproof casing. For all sites, we recorded the
          weather for a complete growing season, mid-March of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</TIMEX>
          to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-October of 1999</TIMEX>. To compare annual differences in
          weather, we also recorded weather from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June of 1998</TIMEX> to
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-October of 1998</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX>. To investigate
          differences within a habitat, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> were equipped
          with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> dataloggers each. Using these data, we
          calculated weather variables that are commonly reported
          in the literature (see below).
        
        
          Temperature
          We calculated the following temperature parameters in
          °C for the entire growing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX>: average, standard
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">deviation</ENAMEX> (of the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30-minute</TIMEX> readings), range, maximum,
          and minimum. We also calculated a "length of growing
          season" parameter equal to the maximum number of
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">consecutive days</TIMEX> without freezing temperatures.
        
        
          Relative humidity
          The growth and survival of a fungal spore germinating
          on a leaf depends on the amount of moisture available in
          the air and the length of time the leaf surface is wet [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</NUMEX> ] . Dew formation can be critical for spore
          germination of many <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> pathogens, and may be the best
          indicator of the proportion of time a habitat has weather
          favorable to fungi. Although the duration of leaf wetness
          is frequently measured in agricultural studies [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] , it
          is not practical for many ecological studies. However,
          relative humidity of the air is a good measure of
          moisture availability [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . The relative humidity ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RH</ENAMEX> ) where

          dataloggers, we calculated the following relative
          humidity parameters for the entire growing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX>:
          average and the standard deviation (of the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30-minute</TIMEX>
          readings), average of daily maximums, and the seasonal
          range, maximum, and minimum.

          e

          that can be retained in air at a given temperature minus
          the actual water vapor pressure in air [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] . This
          measure reflects the desiccating capacity of the air.
          Using the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30-minute</TIMEX> readings of relative humidity and
          temperature from the dataloggers, we calculated the
          average <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VPD</ENAMEX> and the standard deviation for the entire
          growing season.
        
        
          Proportion of time a habitat has weather favorable
          or unfavorable to fungi
          We calculated weather variables that reflected the
          proportion of time a habitat is favorable or unfavorable
          for fungal growth. We calculated the proportion of time
          (based on the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">30-minute</TIMEX> averages over the growing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX>)
          that the temperature was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between 4</NUMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">40°C</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] and
          also had a relative humidity <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">greater than 94%</NUMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Three</TIMEX>
          other indices were calculated as follows: the proportion
          of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> when the temperature remained above <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4°C</TIMEX> and below
          40°C as well as having a maximum relative humidity that
          was (i) <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">greater than 90%</NUMEX>, (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ii</ENAMEX>) <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">greater than 75%</NUMEX>, or (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">iii</ENAMEX>)
          less than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX>. A broad temperature range (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">40°C</NUMEX>) was
          used to represent the range of temperatures likely to
          support most mesophilic fungi [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">2 12 15 18</ENAMEX> ] . Because
          the growth of mesophilic fungi can occur <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 0</TIMEX> and
          50°C with optima from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15 to 40°C</TIMEX>, a temperature of 4°C
          may represent a conservative minimum at which mesophilic
          fungi grow and a temperature of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40°C</TIMEX> may represent a
          conservative maximum at which mesophilic fungi grow.
        
        
          Duration of periods with a favorable or unfavorable
          weather
          We calculated weather variables that reflected the
          duration of consecutive favorable or unfavorable days in
          a habitat. We estimated the average number of consecutive
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">days</TIMEX> during the growing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">season</TIMEX> when the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</TIMEX> temperature
          remained <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 4 and 40°C</TIMEX> as well as having a maximum
          diurnal relative humidity that was (i) <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">greater than 90%</NUMEX>,
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">ii</ENAMEX>) <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">greater than 75%</NUMEX>, or (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">iii</ENAMEX>) <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 50%</NUMEX>. The
          maximum number of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">consecutive days</TIMEX> also was calculated
          for the same <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> parameters.
        
        
          Climate estimated by nearest weather station
          We estimated the climate of each site using the
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</TIMEX> average precipitation and temperature collected
          by weather <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">stations</ENAMEX> located <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4 to 30 km</NUMEX> from the study
          sites. For <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> of the high elevation sites (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis</ENAMEX>,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Racetrack</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Strawberry</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Northern Utah</ENAMEX>), we used
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">records</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alta</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Utah</ENAMEX>, a site with similar altitude and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">location</ENAMEX> (within <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">100 km</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> sites). Climate data
          were obtained from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Western Regional Weather Center</ENAMEX>
          and elsewhere [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] . Climate records covered <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21 to 58</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>, depending on the site.
        
        
          Site-specific factors
          We scored <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> other site-specific factors, the
          presence of nearby water sources and vegetation types
          indicative of moisture [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34 35 36</NUMEX> ] . For the presence of
          nearby water sources, we gave a score of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX> for none,
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">0.5</NUMEX> for ephemeral water sources such as washes, and a
          score of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.0</NUMEX> for habitats with permanent water sources
          such as streams and lakes. We listed the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> most common
          plant <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">species</ENAMEX> at each site (determined visually) and
          scored sites for vegetation types indicative of moisture.
          Plant species characteristic of dry habitats such as
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cacti</ENAMEX> and yucca were given a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</NUMEX>. Each <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">plant</ENAMEX> species
          indicative of intermediate levels of moisture, such as
          juniper, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">pinyon</ENAMEX> pine, scrub <ENAMEX TYPE="PLANT">oak</ENAMEX>, and rabbit brush were
          given a score of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</NUMEX>. We gave a score of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.0</NUMEX> for each
          plant species characteristic of mesic habitats such as
          riparian vegetation, tall forbs, aspen, and spruce.
          Therefore, the highest vegetation score a site could have
          is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.0</NUMEX>.
        
        
          Soil
          We also measured soil properties that might be
          indicators of habitat moisture. To control for variation
          in soil nutrients due to seasonal fluctuations, we
          collected soil from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a month</TIMEX> during the
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">spring of 1999</TIMEX>. Because overtopping vegetation can affect
          the nutrients in the soil below, we collected samples
          away from overtopping vegetation [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] . We discarded
          the top <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> cm of soil and collected <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">2 to 3 kg</NUMEX> of soil up
          to a depth of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> cm. We dried soil <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">48 hours</TIMEX>
          or until constant weight at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">105°C</TIMEX>. For particle size
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">analyses</ENAMEX>, we removed rocks before sieving [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] . We
          determined the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">percent</NUMEX> silt and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">clay</ENAMEX> using a hydrometer.
          We determined soil pH using <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> g of ground soil in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">30</TIMEX> ml
          of distilled <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>. To determine percent organic carbon
          and nitrogen of soil by mass spectroscopy, we first
          removed the inorganic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">carbon</ENAMEX> by bringing soil <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> to
          a pH between <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4 and 5</NUMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">5N hydrochloric acid</ENAMEX>. Soil
          samples were then flash combusted on an elemental
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">analyzer</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carlo Erba</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Milan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX>) coupled to an isotope
          ratio mass spectrometer (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Finnigan MAT</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bremen</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX>)
          operated in continuous flow mode.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Data</ENAMEX> analysis
          We performed univariate and multivariate statistical
          analyses in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SYSTAT</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Version 7</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">JMP</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SAS</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institute Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cary</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NC</ENAMEX>). For differences in fungal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">abundance</ENAMEX> and richness among media <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">types</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX>, we
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">applied Kruskal-Wallis</ENAMEX> nonparametric analysis. Using
          simple linear regression, we analyzed the natural log of
          fungal abundance and richness as a function of the
          previously mentioned weather variables. For periods when
          the dataloggers malfunctioned and did not record
          temperature and humidity, we estimated missing values in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SYSTAT</ENAMEX> by their correlation with data from other seasons
          at the same sites. For example, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">spring</TIMEX> data were missing
          from the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Canyonlands</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">field site</ENAMEX>, so we used <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> and
          fall correlations of relative humidity and temperature
          across all sites to estimate the missing value for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canyonlands</ENAMEX>. There were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">sites</ENAMEX> with missing values
          for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">spring</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX>, and none for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">fall</TIMEX>. To
