        Because randomized cancer screening trials are very
        expensive and sometimes difficult to implement,
        observational <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer screening</ENAMEX> studies can play an
        important role in estimating the efficacy of cancer
        screening during early phases of evaluation of the
        screening test. However the standard methodology for
        observational <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer screening</ENAMEX> studies has various
        limitations. Case-control studies require adequate case
        identification, eligibility criteria for equal access of
        cases and controls to screening, distinguishing symptomatic
        and diagnostic tests, and adjustments for self-selection
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bias</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cohort</ENAMEX> studies often involve natural history
        models which rest upon assumptions about the duration of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">preclinical cancer</ENAMEX> or the growth rate of the tumor, the
        sensitivity of the screening test, and how screening
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">affects cancer</ENAMEX> mortality. Some examples can be found in [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 4 5 6</NUMEX> ] . Importantly natural history <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> based only
        on observational data must implicitly assume no selection
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bias</ENAMEX>, a very tenuous assumption.
        In contrast, periodic screening evaluation (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSE</ENAMEX>), which
        combines estimates from screened subjects to estimate the
        reduction in population <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> mortality associated with
        periodic cancer screening [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8 9</NUMEX> ] , does not involve
        natural history <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">models</ENAMEX> and the associated assumptions.
        However a different set of assumptions is required. In
        certain situations these assumptions may be more plausible
        than the natural history assumptions, so in some
        circumstances, the method may be complementary and possibly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">superior</ENAMEX>, to the natural history modeling approach.
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSE</ENAMEX> starts with the following estimates based directly
        on observed data from a few screenings at regular intervals
        over various ages (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) age-specific rates of cancer
        detection on first screening, interval <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX>, and cancer
        detection on subsequent screenings, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) cancer fatality
        rates following <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> detection at first screening,
        interval cases, and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> detection on subsequent
        screening. For evaluation it is also necessary to estimate
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) the age-specific rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> detection in the 
        absence of screening and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> mortality rate following detection in the 
        absence of screening. Because there
        are no randomized controls the challenge is to estimate
        rates in the absence of screening in a manner that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">mitigates</ENAMEX> selection bias.
        In estimating the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> detection rate in the absence
        of screening <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSE</ENAMEX> mitigates selection bias in a unique
        manner. As will be discussed, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSE</ENAMEX> estimates the
        age-specific detection rate in the absence of screening as
        the sum of the age-specific rates of detection for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX>
        on the first screening, interval <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX> on
        subsequent screenings, minus the age-specific rate of
        detection for <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> on the first screening in subjects one
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year older</TIMEX>. This estimation assumes progressive detection,
        namely that once a <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> is detected on screening it will
        always be detected on screening. Previous versions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSE</ENAMEX>
        made this assumption. However progressive detection is not
        likely to hold for many types of screening <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">modalities</ENAMEX>.
        Fortunately, as we discuss, if progressive detection is
        violated, the estimated detection rate in the absence of
        screening is an upper bound and this can lead to useful
        estimates.
        In estimating the cancer fatality rate following
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">detection</ENAMEX> in the absence of screening, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier</TIMEX> versions of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSE</ENAMEX> used data from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">refusers</ENAMEX> and simply assumed no selection
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bias</ENAMEX>. To avoid this assumption (and the need to collect
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">refusers</ENAMEX>), we estimated the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> mortality rate
        following detection in the absence of screening by the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> mortality rate in interval <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX>. As we discuss,
        this also leads to an upper bound (i.e. optimistic)
        estimate of screening <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">efficacy</ENAMEX>.
        Thus, this version of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSE</ENAMEX> circumvents the problem of
        selection bias by estimating an upper bound. The specific
        estimates of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> detection rates and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> fatality
        rates after cancer detection are not meaningful as separate
        quantities. Fortunately, one can longitudinally combine the
        estimates to estimate an upper bound on the reduction in
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">population cancer</ENAMEX> mortality associated with periodic
        screening. (Given these data, it is not possible to
        estimate reduction in population <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> mortality for other
        intervals between screenings or after periodic screening
        has stopped). The longitudinal combination of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross-sectional</ENAMEX> estimates, which also appears in earlier
        versions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSE</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8 9</NUMEX> ] , is similar to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G-computation</ENAMEX> [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</NUMEX> ] and the method of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Flanders</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Longini</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">11</TIMEX> ] .
        If an upper bound estimate of screening <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">efficacy</ENAMEX> is
        small, a definitive randomized trial to evaluate the effect
        of screening on <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> mortality would not be warranted.
        Thus the upper bound estimate is helpful only if is not
        unreasonably large. To determine if the upper bound is
        reasonable, we estimated its value using data from screened
        subjects in randomized trials of colorectal cancer
        screening [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12 13</NUMEX> ] , <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> screening [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ] , and
        lung <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> screening [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15 16</NUMEX> ] . We then compared this
        estimate to a modified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSE</ENAMEX> estimate using data from all
        subjects, so that estimates of age-specific <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">detection</ENAMEX> in the absence of screening and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> mortality
        in the absence of screening are based on data from
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">randomized</ENAMEX> controls and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">refusers</ENAMEX>.
        We also compared the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSE</ENAMEX> estimates with estimates based
        on a comparison of outcomes in the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> randomized <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>,
        adjusting for <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">refusers</ENAMEX> and mitigating the effect of
        dilution after stopping screening [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . It is important
        to bear in mind that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> estimates are answering
        different questions. For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSE</ENAMEX>, the question is "What is the
        effect of periodic screening starting at a given age and
        ending at a later age<ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">?</ENAMEX>" For comparing randomized <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>,
        the question is "What is the effect of the particular
        screening program in the intervention <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>?"
      
      
        Methods
        
          Simple formulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSE</ENAMEX>
          We derive a simple formulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSE</ENAMEX> and show that it
          gives an upper bound on the estimated reduction in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">population cancer</ENAMEX> mortality.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSE</ENAMEX> requires <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> types of data from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> who
          receive <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> or more screenings at regular intervals. The
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> type of data are the numbers of <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> who
          receive each screen and who are detected with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> as a
          result of screening or in the interval between screens.
          (See Tables <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1, 2, 3, 4</ENAMEX>) The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> type of data are
          numbers of subjects with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> who die from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> and
          are in the risk set <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</TIMEX> after diagnosis. (See Table
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX>)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSE</ENAMEX> involves <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> steps: (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) estimate the
          age-specific incidence of cancer associated with
          different types of detection: <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> screen, interval
          between screens, subsequent screen, <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">refusers</ENAMEX>, and

          controls, if available, (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">2</ENAMEX>) estimate cancer fatality
          rates after cancer detection, and (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3</ENAMEX>) combine these
          estimates to estimate the reduction in population cancer
          mortality associated with periodic cancer screening.
          Because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSE</ENAMEX> requires regular intervals, the analysis
          is restricted to screenings that occur "on-time", namely,
          within a window of time close to the length of interval.
          The length of the window for on-time screenings is
          somewhat arbitrary. A very wide window discards
          relatively few <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>; however it may introduce bias
          into calculations that are based on assuming the
          screening interval equals the midpoint of the window.
          Alternatively, a narrow window might discard too much
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">data</ENAMEX>, increasing the chance for bias from nonrandom
          exclusion of subjects. In designing a study for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSE</ENAMEX>
          analysis, the screening intervals should be as regular as
          possible. Without loss of generality in the following
          discussion, we assume a regular interval between screens
          of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1 year</TIMEX>.

            Detection

          will always be detectable on screening.

           ( 
          a + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) in (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) is the cancer
          detection rate on the first screening among subjects age 
          a + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> at first screening.) The
          graphical proof of (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1</ENAMEX>) in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1generalizes</NUMEX> the
          graphical proof in [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] to allow some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">preclinical cancer</ENAMEX> to be missed on screening. In Figure
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">1,</ENAMEX> 
          Assumption <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> corresponds to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">δ</ENAMEX> = <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0</NUMEX>,
          where δ is the probability that some <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">individuals</ENAMEX> with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">preclinical cancer</ENAMEX> would be detected if screened at age 
          a but missed if screened at age

          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Assumption 7</ENAMEX>, consider a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">woman</ENAMEX> who
          would have been detected with <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 50</TIMEX>,
          but is not screened at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 50</TIMEX> for reasons unrelated to

          There is sometimes confusion about how this relates to
          sensitivity of the screening test. As shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Assumption 1</ENAMEX> implies that the
          sensitivity of the screening test equals <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> if a previous

          A major challenge is how to estimate 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> 
          
            A 
           , the probability of cancer fatality within <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">five</TIMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> of type 
          A detection (i.e. in the absence of
          screening) conditional on no death from competing risk.
          Previous approaches [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3</NUMEX> ] used data from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">refusers</ENAMEX>,
          substituting 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> 
          
            R 
           for 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> 
          
            A 
           . However this requires a strong unreasonable
          assumption as well as data from <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">refusers</ENAMEX>, which is often
          not available.
          As an alternative, we estimate an upper bound on the
          reduction in the population <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> mortality rate from
          screening by estimating the cancer fatality rate in the
          absence of screening using data from <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">interval cancers</ENAMEX>,
          namely, substituting 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> 
          
            I 
           = 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> 
          
            A 
           . The reason this is an upper bound is that <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX>
          arising in the absence of screening are composed of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX> that would have arisen in the interval after a
          negative screening (had there been screening) and <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX>
          that would have been detected on a previous screening
          (had there been screening). The latter cases are
          presumably slower growing (a type of length-biased
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sampling</ENAMEX>) with better survival, so using only the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">interval cancers</ENAMEX> artificially increases the estimated
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>-fatality rate in the absence of screening. (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">One</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">caveat</ENAMEX> is that the survival of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">interval cancers</ENAMEX> may be
          improved due to increased awareness of treatment options
          that would occur as part of a screening program. If the
          effect of length bias is relatively small, substituting 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> 
          
            I 
           for 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">m</ENAMEX> 
          
            A 
           might not be an upper bound, although we believe it
          would be a reasonable approximation.)
        
        
          Step <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>. Reduction in population <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> mortality
          rates due to periodic screening
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSE</ENAMEX> estimates the reduction in population cancer
          mortality rates due to starting periodic cancer screening
          at age 
          a instead of age 
          b , where ages 
          a and 
          b lie in the range of ages at
          initial screening. (This estimate accounts for competing
          risks through the use of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Surv</ENAMEX> ( 
          a , 
          a + <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>)). To avoid different rates
          of overdiagnosis between comparison <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSE</ENAMEX> compares
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">population cancer</ENAMEX> mortality rates in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> hypothetical
          scenarios involving full compliance: Scenario , periodic
          screening from age 
          a until age 
          b and Scenario , no periodic
          screening from age 
          a to age 
          b <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-1</NUMEX> followed by screening at age 
          b . Scenario involves either
          detection on the first screen at age 
          a or detection in the interval or
          on subsequent screens to age 
          b . Scenario involves either
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">detection</ENAMEX> in the absence of screening from ages 
          a to 
          b - 1 or detection on a first
          screen at age 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">b. Screening</ENAMEX> at age 
          b in both Scenarios and avoids
          differential overdiagnosis rates because, if 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Assumption 1</ENAMEX> holds, both scenarios
          and specify equal probabilities of detecting <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> by

          Upper bound if <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Assumption 1</ENAMEX> is violated
          There are <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> basic scenarios in which 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Assumption 1</ENAMEX> could be violated.
          First the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>, or at least the detectable part of
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX>, could regress over time. This would most likely
          occur if the <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> were at a very early stage. Of
          course, early <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">lesions</ENAMEX> are the principal <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">targets</ENAMEX> of
          screening tests. <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</NUMEX>, chance fluctuations in the
          results of the screening test might mask cancer
          detection, particularly if the interval between the
          screening tests were small. For example if the screening
          test were based on a sampling of cells, the screening
          test may, by chance, not include any of the tumor cells.
          For many screening modalities 
          Assumption 1 may not hold.
          As shown in Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>, if 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Assumption 1</ENAMEX> did not hold, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSE</ENAMEX>
          would estimate the cancer incidence rate in the absence
          of screening as 
          q 
          
            A 
           ( 
          a ) + δ, for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">δ > 0</NUMEX>, instead of 
          q 
          
            A 
           ( 
          a ). Thus if 
          Assumption <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX> were not satisfied,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSE</ENAMEX> would overestimate the cancer incidence rate in the
          absence of screening which 
          overestimates the reduction in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">population cancer</ENAMEX> mortality rate. On the other hand, a
          violation of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Assumption 1</ENAMEX> would also imply that
          some <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX> detected on screening in would not have been
          detected on the last screening in which would lower the
          reduction in the population <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> mortality rate in (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4</ENAMEX>).
          However we think this latter situation would have a small
          impact relative to the former which involves the entire
          span of ages at screening and not just the last <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age</TIMEX> at
          screening.
          Thus (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">11</NUMEX>) is an upper bound for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> reasons. First it
          uses interval <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX> to estimate fatality rates
          following <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> diagnosis in the absence of screening.
          Second it is an upper bound if 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Assumption 1</ENAMEX> is violated.

          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Between 1975 and 1978</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> randomized
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 45,000</NUMEX> subjects to either <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> fecal
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">occult</ENAMEX> blood screenings, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> biennial screenings, or no
          screening [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6 7</NUMEX> ] . Due to a lower than expected death
          rate among controls, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX> resumed screening
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1982 and 1986</TIMEX>. After a hiatus of screening of
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">between 3 and 5 years</TIMEX>, the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> screened <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> received
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> additional annual screenings and the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">biennial</TIMEX> screened
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> received <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> additional biennial screenings.
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Approximately 14 percent</NUMEX> of subjects randomized to
          screening did not receive screening. Each screening cycle
          consisted of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hemocult</ENAMEX> slides with planned definitive
          work-up if any slide showed evidence of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">occult blood</ENAMEX>.
          Screenings for the annual <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> were labeled as on time
          if they were done in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the 9 to 15 month</TIMEX> time window since
          the previous screening. Screenings for the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">biennial</TIMEX> group
          were labeled as on-time if they were done <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20 to 28 months</TIMEX>
          since the previous screening. (The longer time window was
          used to keep the loss of data arbitrarily to no more than
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15%</NUMEX>) Excluding the first screening after the resumption
          of screening, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 93 percent</NUMEX> of the annual
          subsequent screenings and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">85 percent</NUMEX> of the biennial
          subsequent screenings were on-time. The age range for the
          analysis was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50 to 75</TIMEX>. For estimating the age-specific
          incidence of <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> among controls, we used data
          collected up to the time of the last screen, which was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> after the start of the study. We increased the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">precision</ENAMEX> of the estimated age-specific <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> incidence
          on the first screen by pooling data on the first
          screening in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> and biennial <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">arms</ENAMEX>. For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> screening, age was divided into intervals of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year</TIMEX>. For <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">biennial</TIMEX> screening, age was divided into

          Starting in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1963</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 60,000</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> were
          randomly assigned to either a study <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> invited for
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four annual</TIMEX> mammograms and physical examinations or to a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> that received no screening within the study
          [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">8</ENAMEX> ] . <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Approximately 1/3</NUMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> in the study
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> refused the first screening and received no

          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Approximately 79 percent</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> screenings, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">76 percent</NUMEX>
          of <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> screenings, and <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">73 percent</NUMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</NUMEX> screenings
          were on time. The age range for the analysis was <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> to
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">64</TIMEX>. For estimating the age-specific incidence of cancer
          among controls, we used data collected up to the time of
          the last screen, which was <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4 years</TIMEX> after the start of the
          study.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mayo Lung Project</ENAMEX> (MLP)
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Between 1971 and 1976</TIMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 9,200</NUMEX> male heavy
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">smokers</ENAMEX> who tested negative on a prevalence (initial)
          screening were randomized to either a study <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> urged
          to undergo radiologic and cytological screening
          examinations <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">every 4 months</TIMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6 years</TIMEX> or a control
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">group</ENAMEX> that at study entry received a recommendation for
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</TIMEX> chest X-rays with no further reminders [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9 10</ENAMEX> ] .
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Approximately 7 percent</NUMEX> of the study group <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> did
          not receive any screenings.
          Because <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSE</ENAMEX> requires a single screening time at each
          round of screening, we restricted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSE</ENAMEX> to the screenings
          in which the time between cytology and x-ray was less
          than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 weeks</TIMEX>. Screenings were labeled as on-time if they
          were done within <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3.5 to 5.5 months</TIMEX> of the previous
          screening and the time between cytology and x-ray was
          less than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">3 weeks</TIMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">Approximately 85 percent</NUMEX> of the
          subsequent screenings were on-time.
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Only yearly</TIMEX> age data were available. Because the
          screenings in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mayo Lung Project</ENAMEX> were scheduled at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">month</TIMEX> intervals, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yearly</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> incidence data for types 
          I and 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">detection</ENAMEX> are approximated using
          the sums of counts for <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> successive screens. Because
          all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> in the control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> had an initial
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">screening</ENAMEX>, we pooled data for detection rates on initial
          screenings in the study and control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX>.
          Unfortunately the initial screening in the control
          group greatly complicated the validation, which requires
          that no screening be performed in the control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. In
          order to better approximate a control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> that received
          no screening, we only used data in controls starting 6
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX> after randomization. The underlying assumption is
          that by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6 years</TIMEX>, most <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX> detected on the prevalence
          screening would have progressed to clinical <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> in the
          absence of intervention. (This may not be true because of
          the likely possibility of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">overdiagnosis</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] and lead
          times that may exceed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6 years</TIMEX>, but it may serve as a
          useful approximation if the amount of overdiagnosis is
          small). Due to the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6-year</TIMEX> wash-out period, we start the
          age range for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSE</ENAMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">51</NUMEX> instead of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45</NUMEX>. We chose 6 years
          for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the washout period</TIMEX> as a compromise. We thought a
          longer washout period would have greatly restricted the
          age range under study and a shorter <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">washout period</TIMEX> would
          have had a much more limited effect.
          We illustrate the calculations for the analysis of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HIP</ENAMEX> data on <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">breast cancer</ENAMEX> screening. The probability of a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">women</ENAMEX> surviving competing risk from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age 40</TIMEX> to each
          successive <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">age up to age 64</TIMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.99</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.99</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.99</NUMEX>,

          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">screenings</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mayo Lung Project</ENAMEX> (MLP)
          Unlike the other examples the confidence intervals for
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSE</ENAMEX> estimates from screened <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSE</ENAMEX> estimates
          from all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> differed considerably (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>). We
          think 
          Assumption 1 may not have held due
          to the short interval between screens and to the fact
          that the performance of sputum cytology screening depends
          on sampling of the tumor cells. Although the <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">95%</NUMEX>
          confidence interval for the difference included zero
          (Figure <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>), its large width means that a substantial bias
          cannot be ruled out. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSE</ENAMEX> estimates were higher than
          the estimated effect of the screening program in the
          trial because ( 
          i ) the former is based on 24 years
          of screening while the latter is based on only 6 years
          and ( 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ii</ENAMEX> ) the effect in the latter was
          reduced by a prevalence screening in the controls. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSE</ENAMEX>
          for screened subjects does not use any data from the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">control</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX>. With <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSE</ENAMEX> for all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX>, we assumed a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">wash</ENAMEX>-out period to try to remove the effect of the
          prevalence screen.
          The results indicate that a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSE</ENAMEX> estimated upper bound
          based on subjects screened is not unreasonable when
          compared to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSE</ENAMEX> estimate based on all <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subjects</ENAMEX> in the
          randomized trial. Because of sampling variability it is
          not surprising that the point estimate of the upper bound
          can be smaller than the point estimate based on all
          subjects.
          We caution that violations of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Assumption 2</ENAMEX> could have a
          substantial impact. 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Assumption 2</ENAMEX> depends on the
          cumulative effect of birth cohort from ages 
          a to 
          b . According to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Moran</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] the
          relative bias due to violation of 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Assumption 2</ENAMEX> is particularly large
          if the age-specific incidence on the first screen changes
          little with age and interval and subsequent <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancers</ENAMEX> are
          relatively rare. In that case <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moran</ENAMEX> advised that other
          methods be applied. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> way to reduce bias from 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Assumption 2</ENAMEX> is to only estimate
          the effect of screening for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">at most 5 years</TIMEX>. That way the
          cumulative birth cohort effect would be limited to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only 5</NUMEX>
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years</TIMEX>.
        
      
      
        Conclusion
        We think the major role of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSE</ENAMEX> is to rule out screening
        modalities that have little benefit. This information is
        useful when making policy decisions about screening, or
        when considering a large randomized trial to definitively
        compare benefits and harms of screening strategies. Because
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSE</ENAMEX> is estimating an upper bound when 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Assumption 1</ENAMEX> is violated, if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PSE</ENAMEX>
        estimates little reduction in population <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> mortality,
        the true reduction in population <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">cancer</ENAMEX> mortality due to
        periodic screening is likely small. If any effects of birth
        cohort are minimal, further evaluation with a randomized
        trial would not be warranted.
