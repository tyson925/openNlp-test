        Global emergence of pathogenic infectious diseases by
        both natural and intentional means presents a formidable
        challenge to infectious disease surveillance and response,
        namely timely and efficient pathogen detection. Many
        laboratory methods exist for identifying <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pathogens</ENAMEX>, but
        most require exquisite care in sample handling and
        processing prior to characterization of a pathogen. In
        addition, costly and perishable reagents, equipment, and
        supplies are required for sensitive and specific detection.
        The ideal detection system would integrate sample
        processing and pathogen characterization into a single
        automated device that would eliminate laborious, and time
        consuming sample processing and costly detection.
        Bioelectronic detection of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nucleic acids</ENAMEX> on a miniature
        solid support is one of the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> steps toward development
        of such an integrated detection device.
        Bioelectronic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> detection involves forming an
        electronic circuit mediated by nucleic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> hybridization
        and it serves as the basis for a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> detection system
        called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">eSensorâ„¢</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3 4</NUMEX> ] . This system uses low-density
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA chips</ENAMEX> containing electrodes coated with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> capture
        probes. Target DNA present in the sample hybridizes
        specifically both to capture probes and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">ferrocene</ENAMEX> labeled
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> probes in solution thereby generating an electric
        current. Current eSensor <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> chips contain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">as many as 36</NUMEX>
        electrodes for simultaneous detection of multiple pathogens
        from a single sample.
        Many pathogens cause both acute and chronic <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">disease</ENAMEX> at
        relatively low copy number and may be difficult or
        impossible to propagate in culture. Thus, most pathogen
        detection <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">systems</ENAMEX> rely on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nucleic acid</ENAMEX> amplification by
        using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). One highly effective
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">amplification</ENAMEX> strategy targets conserved sequences among
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> of interest. Such broad-range PCR
        strategies have been used to identify and characterize
        several known and previously uncharacterized <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">bacteria</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5 6</NUMEX>
        ] and viruses [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 8</NUMEX> ] . In order to maximize the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">utility</ENAMEX> of
        these effective pathogen <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nucleic acid</ENAMEX> amplification
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">systems</ENAMEX>, amplification needs to be coupled with rapid,
        sensitive, and specific detection. Bioelectronic DNA
        detection by use of the eSensor chip might fulfill this
        need.
        Human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">papillomaviruses</ENAMEX> (HPV) serve as an ideal model
        system for determining the efficiency and feasibility of
        eSensor <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> detection technology since there are at least
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> distinct genital <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">HPV</ENAMEX> types that can be effectively
        amplified with broad-range consensus PCR primers [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . We
        designed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> eSensor chips, each containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</NUMEX> probes
        specific for the conserved <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">L1</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPV</ENAMEX> genome. We
        evaluated clinical cervical cytology samples known to
        contain <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> or more HPV <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">types</ENAMEX>. The eSensor <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> detection
        platform successfully detected the correct HPV type in most
        of these clinical samples, demonstrating that the system
        provides a rapid, sensitive, specific, and economical
        approach for multiple-pathogen detection and identification
        from a single sample.
      
      
        Methods
        
          eSensorâ„¢ <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> Chip Design
          We used previously described printed circuit board
          technology to manufacture eSensor chips with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> gold
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">electrodes</ENAMEX>, one reference electrode, and one auxiliary
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">electrode</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3 4</NUMEX> ] . Each <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">electrode</ENAMEX> was wired to a
          connector at the edge of the chip. Capture probes were
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">synthesized</ENAMEX> using an alkane <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">chain</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>
          terminated at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3</ENAMEX>'-end with a disulfide which was
          spotted onto the gold electrode on the chips to form a
          self-assembled <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">monolayer</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . The chips were glued
          into a plastic housing with a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">port</ENAMEX> for sample
          introduction.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hybsimulator</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RNAture, Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Irvine</ENAMEX>, CA) was used to
          design the HPV target mimics, and signal and capture
          probes. For these experiments, we designed capture (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table</ENAMEX>
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) and signal (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>) probes to hybridize specifically
          to the exon sequence of Î²-globin and to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPV</ENAMEX> sequences
          within the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">450-bp L1</ENAMEX> region amplified by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PGMY</ENAMEX> primer
          set. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Signal</ENAMEX> probes (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2</ENAMEX>) tagged with <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</NUMEX> ferrocenes
          were synthesized with a modified adenine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">N6</NUMEX>)
          containing a ferrocene substitution on the ribose ring [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11</NUMEX> ] . No signal probes were synthesized for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPV</ENAMEX> types
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33, 39, 55</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">73</NUMEX>. HPV target mimic oligonucleotides
          were synthesized for types <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">6, 11, 16, 18, 26, 31, 35, 40</TIMEX>,
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">42, 45, 51, 52, 54, 56, 58, 59, 66, 68, 82, 83</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">84</NUMEX>
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3</ENAMEX>).
        
        
          Sample selection and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> extraction
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Residual ThinPrep</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cytyc Corporation</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boxborough, MA</ENAMEX>)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">cervical samples</ENAMEX> previously tested for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPV</ENAMEX> using the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roche</ENAMEX> line blot assay [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] were used in this study.
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Twenty</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> containing <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24</NUMEX> of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">types</ENAMEX> on the
          reverse line blot were selected for extraction and
          testing. (No <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">samples</ENAMEX> were positive for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPV</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53, 55</TIMEX>, and
          <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">57</TIMEX>.) Therefore a total of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">types</ENAMEX> could be evaluated
          (there were <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</NUMEX> HPV capture and signal probes minus no
          clinical sample containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HPV</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">53</TIMEX> leaves <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> possible HPV
          type answers). Samples were coded so that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">investigators</ENAMEX>
          were blinded to the presence of multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">types</ENAMEX>. DNA
          was extracted from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">250 Î¼L</NUMEX> aliquots by using the QIAmp DNA
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mini Kit</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">QIAGEN Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Valencia</ENAMEX>, CA). The procedure
          provided with the kit was followed except that the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteinase K digestion</ENAMEX> was done <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">overnight</TIMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">56Â°C</TIMEX>.
          Following <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA elution</ENAMEX> from the column, <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> was
          concentrated in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Centricon Centrifugal Filter Device</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">YM-100</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Millipore Corporation</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bedford MA</ENAMEX>) according to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">manufacturer</ENAMEX>'s specifications. Each DNA sample was
          brought to <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 Î</NUMEX>¼L with the addition of ultra pure
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">water</ENAMEX>.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">HPV PCR</ENAMEX> and Typing
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Five</NUMEX> microliters of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">purified DNA</ENAMEX> from cytology samples
          was used in each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> assay. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HPV DNA</ENAMEX> was amplified with
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">PGMY09/PGMY11</ENAMEX> primer system that uses a multiplex
          format to amplify both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPV</ENAMEX> and Î²-globin in the same tube
          [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">9</ENAMEX> ] . To allow for strand separation, only the
          downstream <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">primers</ENAMEX> designated <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">PGMY11</ENAMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> Î²-globin
          primer were biotinylated (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). The use of one
          biotinylated primer to amplify the product was still
          sufficient to verify the amplified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPV</ENAMEX> type by reverse
          line blot. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amplification</ENAMEX> without <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA template</ENAMEX> was used to
          monitor contamination.
          Avidin-coated beads were used to harvest the
          biotin-labeled DNA strand from <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">50 Î¼l</NUMEX> of product. The
          biotin-free <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA strand</ENAMEX> was then used in the assay.
          Briefly, the target mimic or target <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> was mixed with a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> probe cocktail (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">125</NUMEX> nM of each signal probe) in a
          hybridization buffer (proprietary). This mixture was
          injected into the eSensor chip for hybridization at 40Â°C
          for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 to 8 hours</TIMEX>. The chips were then scanned by an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AC</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">voltammetry</ENAMEX> technique built into the eSensor detection
          device called the eSensor <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4800</TIMEX>, from <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">-50</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">+550</NUMEX>
          millivolts, to detect and interpret the electrochemical
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> generated during <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">hybridization</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Investigators</ENAMEX>
          recording eSensor results remained blinded to prior or
          current HPV results.
          <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">Forty microliters</NUMEX> of the amplified products was also
          independently tested for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPV</ENAMEX> using a reverse line probe
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">assay</ENAMEX> (typing strip and reagents generously provided by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Janet Kornegay</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roche Molecular Systems, Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alameda</ENAMEX>,
          CA). In each case the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPV</ENAMEX> results on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">strip</ENAMEX> were
          concordant with prior results. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPV</ENAMEX> detection and typing
          results from eSensor and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roche</ENAMEX> were then directly
          compared.
        
      
      
        Results
        The electrochemical signal is generated when the HPV
        amplicon hybridizes to the capture <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> and
        ferrocene-labeled signal probe, thereby bringing the
        reporter molecule, ferrocene, into contact with the
        self-assembled monolayer on the gold electrode (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>). An
        alternating current voltammogram is obtained when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPV</ENAMEX> is
        detected in a sample but no electronic signal is registered
        when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> is absent from the sample. (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>).
        Many of the HPV target mimics tested resulted in a
        specific signal, with the exception of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPV</ENAMEX> types <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16, 26</TIMEX>,
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35, 40, 42, 51, 52</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">82</NUMEX>. This nonspecific hybridization
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> generally resulted from a long stretch of
        complementary sequences (<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">6-8</ENAMEX> bases) among the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPV</ENAMEX> types due
        to their close genetic relatedness. Nonspecific
        hybridization was eliminated by introducing a mismatched
        base to the complementary region in the signal probes for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPV</ENAMEX> types <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16, 26, 35, 42</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">82</NUMEX> and the capture probes for
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPV</ENAMEX> types <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40, 42, 51, 52</TIMEX>, and <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">82</NUMEX>. For instance, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPV</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">signal</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> hybridized with both the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">HPV 16</NUMEX> target mimic
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, left <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>) and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HPV 52</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">capture probe</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">3,</ENAMEX>
        center <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>). This cross-reactivity was eliminated by
        changing the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> A <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">base</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">5</ENAMEX>'-end of signal <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> to
        a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">G</ENAMEX> base (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, right <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX>). In addition, we
        demonstrated that one base modification of the signal probe
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>, left and right panels) generated minimal negative
        impact to the assay signal level. Applying this strategy,
        we were able to effectively reduce the cross-reactivity
        among the signal and capture probes for those <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPV</ENAMEX> types
        where problems of non-specific signal had initially been
        encountered without compromising hybridization
        strengths.
        In most instances for the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</NUMEX> samples tested, there was
        perfect concordance between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPV</ENAMEX> type(s) detected by
        reverse line blot and the eSensor system (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>). The
        eSensor detected <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">18</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">86%</NUMEX>) of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">types</ENAMEX>. In samples with
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">multiple HPV</ENAMEX> types amplified by the consensus primer system
        and typed by reverse line blot (but blinded to the
        individual conducting the eSensor assay), the eSensor
        successfully detected the multiple <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">HPV</ENAMEX> targets in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">all six</NUMEX>
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">samples</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>).
      
      
        Discussion
        We have presented a model application of a novel
        electronic detection platform [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 2 3 4</NUMEX> ] . We used <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HPV</ENAMEX> as
        a model infectious disease system because consensus primers
        are available that amplify <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 30</NUMEX> closely related
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">genital HPV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">types</ENAMEX>. The resulting amplicons are extremely
        similar, and this relatedness challenges the ability of the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">eSensor</ENAMEX> technology to distinguish accurately among these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">pathogens</ENAMEX>. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> optimization steps involved evaluation
        of electrochemical signal generation by using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPV</ENAMEX> target
        mimics. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cross-hybridization</ENAMEX> was observed between a subset
        of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPV</ENAMEX> target mimics and the capture and signal probes.
        This cross-hybridization was easily overcome by the
        introduction of mismatched base pairs. The effectiveness of
        single-base mismatch discrimination of the eSensor has been
        demonstrated by using wild type and mutant strains of human
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">immunodeficiency</ENAMEX> virus [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">3</ENAMEX> ] .
        We used the eSensor <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> chip to determine the presence
        of single or <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple HPV</ENAMEX> types in cervical cytology
        samples. While the presence of the target <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPV</ENAMEX> type was
        known, the presence of other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPV</ENAMEX> types in the same sample
        remained blinded (e.g., the <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">HPV 42</ENAMEX> in a clinical sample was
        identified but the presence of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">HPV 68</NUMEX> in the same sample
        was not known to those performing electrochemical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">detection</ENAMEX>). There was good concordance for the detection of
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX> HPV type by the eSensor <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Detection System</ENAMEX>.
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Eighteen</TIMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">86%</NUMEX>) of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">21</NUMEX> target <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">types</ENAMEX> represented on the
        chip were readily detected by the eSensor (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 4</ENAMEX>); HPV
        <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40, 45 and 54</TIMEX> were not detected. Some of the other
        discrepancies could be due to lack of rigorous optimization
        of sensitivity parameters for the eSensor system, such as
        the weak HPV 54 result on reverse line blot and lack of
        detection on eSensor. Low-level signals on the line probe
        assay have been validated by sequencing the amplified
        product [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">12</TIMEX> ] . For <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">HPV 40</NUMEX> discrepancy, the capture probe
        design may not have been optimal to allow for hybridization
        with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPV</ENAMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">target</ENAMEX>. These <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">types</ENAMEX> may be variant
        types that did not hybridize to the capture <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT_DESC">probe</ENAMEX> and
        subsequently could not be detected by the signal probe. Not
        only are there <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">over 200</TIMEX> HPV types, but several sequence
        variants of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">types</ENAMEX> are known to exist [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">13</TIMEX> ] . Most
        hybridization reactions could be analyzed after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 hours</TIMEX>,
        although in several instances up to <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8 hours</TIMEX> of
        hybridization time was required. The intent of this study
        was to use HPV as a model system to assess the feasibility
        of electrochemical detection with the eSensor chip of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">multiple pathogens</ENAMEX>, not to achieve perfect concordance of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HPV</ENAMEX> detection with the reverse line blot.
        In this model assay, we have performed optimization of
        probe sequences and assay protocol by using synthesized
        target mimics. The resultant assay correctly identified
        nearly all HPV type in the clinical samples. No attempt to
        further optimize the assay using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> amplicons, rather than
        target mimics, was made and neither was the PCR process
        optimized for detection by using the eSensor <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> detection
        system. This work demonstrates the ease with which a
        multi-analyte <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">panel</ENAMEX> assay can be prototyped using the
        eSensor <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> detection system. For clinical applications,
        the prototype assay can be readily fine-tuned by optimizing
        the conditions for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PCR</ENAMEX> and hybridization to yield
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">concordance</ENAMEX> levels approaching <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100%</NUMEX> (data not
        published).
      
      
        Conclusions
        The bioelectronic detection platform described here
        includes disposable <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA chips</ENAMEX> and laboratory-based
        electronic <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">readers</ENAMEX> and is a <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX>-generation system that
        ultimately will facilitate the development of relatively
        low cost, arrayed nucleic acid-based tests. For widespread
        clinical laboratory adoption, these arrays must have
        clinically appropriate densities compatible with the needs
        of molecular diagnostics <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">laboratories</ENAMEX>, ( 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">i.e.</ENAMEX> , low cost and not
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">labor-intensive</ENAMEX>). The system described could also be
        developed as a foundation for devices to be used for
        point-of-care testing for other infectious diseases.
