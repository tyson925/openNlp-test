        Regulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-dependent processes such as
        transcription, replication, and strand repair requires
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">bending</ENAMEX> and unwinding of compacted chromatin structure.
        Many of these structural changes are mediated by high
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mobility</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">group</ENAMEX> (HMG) <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, a diverse superfamily of
        non-histone chromosomal <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that were originally
        classified by their electrophoretic mobility [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">1</ENAMEX> ] . HMG
        proteins contain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX>-binding domains that allow them to
        produce specific changes in target DNA structure [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3</NUMEX> ] .
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</NUMEX> structurally distinct classes of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HMG proteins</ENAMEX> have
        been defined; the HMG-nucleosomal binding <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, the
        HMG-AT-hook <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX>, and the HMG-box <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> (whose canonical
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> are referred to as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HMGN</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HMGA</ENAMEX> and HMGB
        respectively) [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">4</ENAMEX> ] . In addition, a large number of
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> have been found that contain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HMG protein</ENAMEX> related
        motifs.
        All <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the HMG-box <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> possess a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70-80</NUMEX> amino
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid DNA</ENAMEX>-binding domain (the HMG-box) related to a motif
        originally identified in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">HMGB1</TIMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">5</ENAMEX> ] . The HMG-box may also
        be involved in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-protein interactions</ENAMEX>. For example,
        RAG1 has been reported to interact with the tandem
        HMG-boxes of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">HMGB1</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">HMGB2</NUMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">6</ENAMEX> ] . Where it has been
        studied, HMG-boxes have been shown to be structurally
        related, forming <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> Î±-helices in a characteristic
        L-shaped <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 7</NUMEX> ] . The distortion of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> by the
        HMG-box is primarily mediated through contacts with the
        minor groove of the DNA helix, potentially allowing
        simultaneous binding of other transcriptional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> to
        the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 9</NUMEX> ] . The HMG-box family has often been
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subdivided</ENAMEX> based on <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> binding properties. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">group</ENAMEX> of
        HMG-box <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> recognizes structural features of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> with
        low or absent sequence specificity. These <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> have
        broad tissue distribution, and typically contain multiple
        HMG-box motifs. The <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> group of HMG-box proteins
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">recognizes DNA</ENAMEX> in a sequence-specific manner akin to more
        traditional transcription factors. These <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> have a
        restricted pattern of expression and typically contain only
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> HMG-box [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">Members</ENAMEX> of both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">groups</ENAMEX> of HMG-box
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proteins</ENAMEX> also bind altered <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">nucleic acid</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">structures</ENAMEX> such as
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>-way junctions [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11 12 13</NUMEX> ] and cisplatinated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">14</TIMEX> ]
        .
        HMG-box family <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are found in a variety of
        eukaryotic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">organisms</ENAMEX> and most are known or suspected
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">regulators</ENAMEX> of gene expression. We recently identified a
        gene designated 
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tox</ENAMEX> (for thymocyte
        selection-associated HMG-box gene), encoding a novel
        nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> that shows a highly regulated pattern of
        expression during thymocyte differentiation. The TOX
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">526</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> with an acidic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal
        <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">domain</ENAMEX>, a bipartite nuclear localization signal sequence
        and a single centrally located HMG-box motif [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] .
        Forced expression of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TOX</ENAMEX> in the thymus of transgenic <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX>
        leads to changes in the differentiation program of
        developing T cells. These studies led us to propose that
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TOX</ENAMEX> is involved in regulating gene expression during
        critical developmental <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">checkpoints</ENAMEX> in the thymus, and
        possibly elsewhere in the immune system. For example, TOX
        may also be involved in germinal <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">center</ENAMEX> B lymphocyte
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">development</ENAMEX> and/or function [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">16</TIMEX> ] .
        Several other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HMG-box proteins</ENAMEX> also play important roles
        in lymphocyte development [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">17</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">Mice doubly</ENAMEX> deficient in
        lymphocyte enhancement <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">factor-1</ENAMEX> (LEF-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) and T cell factor-1
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TCF-1</ENAMEX>) have a complete <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">block</ENAMEX> in development of T cells [
        <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 19</NUMEX> ] , while deficiency of SRY-box containing <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> 4
        (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SOX-4</ENAMEX>) in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> results in a lack of pro-B cell expansion
        and mild perturbation of thymocyte development [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">20</TIMEX> ] .
        Unlike these HMG-box <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, however, we find that the
        HMG-box of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TOX</ENAMEX> is more closely related to the DNA binding
        domain of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sequence-independent HMG-box proteins</ENAMEX>. In
        addition, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> other predicted proteins share almost
        identical HMG-box domains with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TOX</ENAMEX>, defining a new
        subfamily of HMG-box <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TOX</ENAMEX> subfamily is highly
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">conserved</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mice</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>, and is distributed on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>
        separate chromosomes. Outside the HMG-box domain, these
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are less well conserved, suggesting that they may
        have non-overlapping functions. Our analysis also suggests
        that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> exons encoding the HMG-box domain may be the
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">evolutionary</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">unit</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TOX</ENAMEX> subfamily, found as a single
        copy in an invertebrate and replicated in early
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">vertebrates</ENAMEX>. This expanded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TOX</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">subfamily</ENAMEX> likely took on new
        functions, including specific roles in the mammalian immune
        system.
      
      
        Results and Discussion
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">TOX</ENAMEX> resembles sequence-independent HMG-box family
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>
          Although there are few amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> positions within the
          HMG-box motif that are conserved throughout the HMG-box
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein superfamily</ENAMEX>, there are highly conserved <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>
          within sequence-dependent and sequence-independent
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">subgroups</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">21</TIMEX> ] . The vast majority of HMG-boxes have a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">tryptophan</ENAMEX> in helix <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX>, often as part of a GXXW motif
          (where <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">X</NUMEX> denotes any amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX>) [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 5</NUMEX> ] . Similarly, TOX
          has a tryptophan at this position, although as part of
          the less commonly found AXXW sequence. Figure 1shows an
          alignment of the HMG-box region of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TOX</ENAMEX> with HMG-box
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">motifs</ENAMEX> found in <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</NUMEX> other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> representing the two
          major subfamilies of HMG-box <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Human SRY</ENAMEX>, murine
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SOX-4</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SOX-17</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">LEF-1</ENAMEX> contain single HMG-box motifs
          and bind <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> in a sequence-specific fashion. Murine HMGB1
          and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast NHP6A bind DNA</ENAMEX> in a sequence-independent
          fashion. <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">UBF-1</ENAMEX> specifically binds the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">ribosomal RNA gene</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">promoter</ENAMEX>, although no particular recognition sequence can
          be identified [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">22</TIMEX> ] . HMGB1 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">UBF-1</ENAMEX> contain multiple
          HMG-box motifs, although only one is shown (indicated by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">decimal in Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>).
          Positions <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5, 10, 65 and 70</TIMEX> (as numbered in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</NUMEX>) are
          included in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> that have previously been shown
          together to be sufficient to confer sequence specificity
          to an HMG-box <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23</TIMEX> ] . Positions <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5 and 10</TIMEX> are
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">proline</ENAMEX> and serine, respectively, in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">sequence-independent DNA</ENAMEX> binders as well as in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TOX</ENAMEX>. In
          contrast, the sequence specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HMG-box proteins</ENAMEX> have
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">hydrophobic</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">V</ENAMEX> or I) and asparagine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> present at
          positions <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">5 and 10</TIMEX>, respectively. The asparagine at
          position <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">10</TIMEX> makes contact with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> in the hSRY-DNA
          complex [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">24</TIMEX> ] , as does the serine at this position in
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">NHP6A</NUMEX>-DNA complex [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] . A hydrophobic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue</ENAMEX> at
          position <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> that can partially intercalate into <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> plays
          a role in <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> binding of some sequence-independent
          HMG-box <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7 25 26</ENAMEX> ] . Position <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> is the
          hydrophobic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residue phenylalanine</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TOX</ENAMEX>, in contrast to
          the polar <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> found at this position in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SRY</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SOX</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">LEF-1</ENAMEX>. Similarly, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TOX</ENAMEX> is more closely
          aligned with the sequence-independent HMG-box proteins
          than the sequence-specific transcription factors at
          position <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">65</TIMEX>. The tyrosine at this position (shared with
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TOX</ENAMEX>) is a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> contact in the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">NHP6A</NUMEX>-DNA complex [ <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">7</ENAMEX> ] .
          Moreover, there is a conserved proline at position <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX> of
          the sequence-specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA binding proteins</ENAMEX> that truncates
          the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</NUMEX> alpha helix of the HMG-box structure allowing
          additional <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> contacts [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">24 27 28</NUMEX> ] . This proline is
          absent from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TOX</ENAMEX> and the sequence-independent HMG-box
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. Based on these observations, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TOX</ENAMEX> appears to
          best fit into the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">structure-dependent</ENAMEX> but
          sequence independent HMG-box <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA binding proteins</ENAMEX>.
          However, this has yet to be determined empirically by DNA
          binding studies.
        
        
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TOX</ENAMEX> is a <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX> of a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> subfamily with
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly</NUMEX> identical HMG-box sequences
          
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tox</ENAMEX> is the murine homologue of the
          human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gene KIAA0808</ENAMEX>, previously isolated from brain
          tissue [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] . <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TOX</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">KIAA0808</ENAMEX> are <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 90%</NUMEX>
          identical at both the nucleotide and amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid</ENAMEX> level [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> ] . Using BLAST program searches [ <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30 31</NUMEX> ] we have now
          identified <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX> other murine genes that are predicted to
          encode <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> that have nearly identical HMG-box
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TOX</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2A,2<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B</ENAMEX>). Human homologues of the
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> additional murine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> have also been identified
          (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2A,2<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B</ENAMEX>). A full length murine <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">cDNA</ENAMEX> representing
          Langerhans cell <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein 1</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">LCP1</NUMEX>) was originally cloned
          from maturing epidermal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Langerhans</ENAMEX> cells, while its human
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homologue</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">KIAA0737</ENAMEX> was cloned from human brain [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29</TIMEX> ] as
          was a cDNA encoding <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">TNRC9</TIMEX> (also known as <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CAGF9</ENAMEX>) [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">32</TIMEX> ] .
          Searches of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">the EST</TIMEX> database confirm that all family
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> are expressed at the level of mRNA, and we have
          shown that <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">KIAA0808</ENAMEX> is expressed at the level of protein
          using a cross-reactive anti-TOX antisera (data not
          shown). 
          Tox gene family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> are found
          on <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> different chromosomes in human (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2A).
          Similarly, the murine 
          Tox gene <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> is distributed
          across <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> different chromosomes, in regions of synteny
          conserved between <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> and human (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2A).
          All murine and human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TOX</ENAMEX> subfamily <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> have a
          single centrally located HMG-box (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2A,2<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">B</ENAMEX>). Within the
          <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</NUMEX> <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">70</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> of the HMG-box region <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">only six</NUMEX>
          positions show any variation and of those <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</NUMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> are
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">shared</ENAMEX> between all family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> except <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TOX/</ENAMEX> KIAA0808
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">homologues</ENAMEX> while the remaining <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> changes are found in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">LOC241768/ C20ORF100</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX>. Despite high similarity in
          overall structure between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HMG</ENAMEX>-boxes, individual domains
          exhibit distinct DNA binding characteristics as discussed
          above, and can interact with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> in different
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">orientations</ENAMEX>. The high degree of conservation of the
          particular TOX-type HMG-box sequence is therefore likely
          to reflect a specific <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">DNA</ENAMEX> and/or <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein interaction</ENAMEX> that
          is important for function of this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein subfamily</ENAMEX>.
          There is also complete identity of the HMG-boxes
          between murine and human homologues of a given family
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX>, consistent with formation of the 
          Tox subfamily by gene duplication
          prior to the rodentia and primate split. This is further
          supported by the genomic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">organization</ENAMEX> of the genes. The 
          Tox gene has <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC_DESC">exons</ENAMEX> spanning more
          than <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">300 kb</NUMEX> (data not shown). The HMG-box region of TOX
          is encoded by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX> exons, as is found in some <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">SOX genes</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33 34</NUMEX> ] , although the exact intron break is unique to
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TOX</ENAMEX>. Interestingly, the position of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">intron</ENAMEX>/exon
          boundary encoding the HMG-box is precisely conserved
          among all family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> and human (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2B). In
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">general</ENAMEX>, the loss or gain of an intron represents a major
          genetic rearrangement and is a relatively rare event when
          compared with sequence changes [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">35</TIMEX> ] . It is highly
          unlikely that an intron would arise at the same sequence
          position in different gene lineages, further supporting
          that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TOX</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> arose by gene duplication.
          In addition to the box itself, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TOX</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> members
          contain <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">conserved lysine residues</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NH</ENAMEX> 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> -terminus of the HMG-box motif,
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">imbedded</ENAMEX> in the consensus sequence [<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KR</ENAMEX>(<ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX>) 
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5</NUMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GKKXKXPKKKKK</ENAMEX>] (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2C). This
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX> is the likely nuclear localization signal (NLS)
          for these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] , similar to the bipartite NLS
          found in nucleoplasmin [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">36</TIMEX> ] . The <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> exception is the
          Langerhans cell protein-1 (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">LCP1</NUMEX>)/KIAA0737 <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">pair</ENAMEX>, which
          lacks the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</NUMEX> basic residue of the motif. Nuclear
          localization signals are also highly conserved in SRY-box
          and other <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">HMG-box proteins</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">37</TIMEX> ] . Basic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX>
          outside of the HMG box motif may also function to
          stabilize DNA binding by these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">38</TIMEX> ] .
          Outside of the HMG-box and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NLS</ENAMEX>, the murine and human
          homologues of the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</NUMEX> additional pairs of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> are
          highly conserved, as we reported for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TOX</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">KIAA0808</ENAMEX> [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</NUMEX> ] . LCP1 and <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">KIAA0737 proteins</ENAMEX> are <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 94%</NUMEX>
          identical, while <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">LOC241768 and C20ORF100</TIMEX> share <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">85%</NUMEX>
          identity. Comparison of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">LOC244759 and TNRC9</TIMEX> revealed that
          these <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> were highly similar, with the exception of
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>termini. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal domain of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TNRC9</ENAMEX> contains an
          expansion of trinucleotide repeats coding for glutamine.
          Long polyglutamine repeats have been found in a number of
          transcription factors [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">39</TIMEX> ] . Notably, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C-terminus of</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">murine</ENAMEX> HMG-box <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein SRY</ENAMEX> contains a large polyglutamine
          repeat <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">region</ENAMEX> that is responsible for the sex-determining
          function of this <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">40</TIMEX> ] . However, a number of
          neurodegenerative disorders, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="DISEASE">Huntington disease</ENAMEX>
          and spinobulbar muscular <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">atrophy</ENAMEX>, are also strongly
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">associated</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> containing a polyglutamine
          stretch [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">41</TIMEX> ] . Conformational change and protein
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">misfolding</ENAMEX> in the expanded polyglutamine region is
          believed to be the molecular basis of the pathogenesis [
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42</NUMEX> ] . Whether the presence of polyglutamine repeats in
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">C-terminus</ENAMEX> of human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TNRC9</ENAMEX> is important for function
          or alternatively hinders its ability to form a functional
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">protein</ENAMEX> remains to be determined.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TOX</ENAMEX> family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> are <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 20-30%</NUMEX> identical
          outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NLS/HMG</ENAMEX>-box <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">region</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 1</ENAMEX>). A detailed
          alignment of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TOX</ENAMEX> and its close relative LCP1 is shown in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3A. The HMG-box splits <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TOX</ENAMEX> family <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> into <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>
          domains of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 200</NUMEX>-300 amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>. The
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal domains (exclusive of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NLS</ENAMEX> and HMG-box) are
          acidic for all human and murine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TOX</ENAMEX> family <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> (pI
          range of <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">4-6</ENAMEX>). In the context of the nucleus, acidic
          domains are often <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-protein</ENAMEX> interaction domains.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal regions are also more similar than
          C-terminal regions when comparing different TOX subfamily
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> (for example, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3A). The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal regions
          tend to be enriched for the presence of proline and to a
          lesser extent glutamine <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">residues</ENAMEX> (data not shown). The
          C-terminal domains of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">TOX/ KIAA0808</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">LOC244579/</ENAMEX> TNRC9
          are mildly to strongly basic respectively, while those of
          LCP1 and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">KIAA0737</ENAMEX> are acidic. Despite overall similarity,
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal domain of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">LOC241768</ENAMEX> is acidic while its
          human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">homologue</ENAMEX> is basic.
        
        
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Toxand</ENAMEX> LCP1 genes have unique patterns of
          expression
          Unlike other sequence-independent HMG-box <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>,
          which show ubiquitous tissue expression, we have
          previously shown that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TOX</ENAMEX> has a highly regulated tissue
          and developmental expression profile. The 
          Tox gene is most abundantly
          expressed in the thymus followed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">liver</ENAMEX> and brain;
          it is poorly expressed or absent in other tissues,
          including heart, kidney, lung, muscle, skin, intestine,
          spleen stomach and testis [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> ] . LCP1 is also expressed
          in thymus, although whether expression is regulated
          during different developmental stages remains to be
          determined (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3B). Unlike 
          Tox , however, the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">LCP1</NUMEX> gene is
          most highly expressed in testis (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 3B). In addition,
          LCP1 is more highly expressed than 
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tox</ENAMEX> in skin, consistent with
          isolation of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">LCP1</NUMEX> from Langerhans cells. LCP1 is also
          expressed in most other tissues tested (with the possible
          exception of muscle) and thus has a more widespread
          pattern of expression than previously found for the 
          Tox gene.
        
        
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TOX</ENAMEX> subfamily is conserved in early vertebrates
          and mosquito
          It has been suggested that at various times throughout
          metazoan evolution, HMG-box containing sequences
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">duplicated</ENAMEX>, in each case leaving <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</NUMEX> redundant copy,
          which was free to evolve a new function or be lost from
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG_DESC">genome</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">33</TIMEX> ] . The spare HMG-box-containing fragment
          recruited preexisting functional <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">domains</ENAMEX> and formed
          mosaic <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> capable of rapidly taking on novel
          function. In this study, we examined the evolutionary
          history of the TOX HMG domain. As discussed above, data
          suggest that duplication of genes encoding the TOX-like
          HMG-box occurred prior to mammalian radiation. Analysis
          of the genome of 
          Fugu rubripes (pufferfish) revealed
          that this duplication was even more ancient.
          It has been shown that although the 
          Fugu rubripes genome is only
          one-eighth the size of the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genome</ENAMEX>, it contains a
          comparable complement of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein-encoding genes</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">43</TIMEX> ] .
          We found <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</NUMEX> sequences on different scaffolds in the
          pufferfish genome that <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">encode</ENAMEX> predicted proteins
          containing a TOX-like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HMG</ENAMEX>-box (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). The genes present
          on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Scaffold-182</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Scaffold-2474</ENAMEX> both encode <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</NUMEX> amino
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid proteins</ENAMEX>. The gene present on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Scaffold-16</ENAMEX> encodes a
          <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">365</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid protein</ENAMEX>, while the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Scaffold-5698</ENAMEX> gene
          encodes a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">159</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fugu</ENAMEX> HMG-box
          sequences are nearly identical to mammalian TOX
          HMG-boxes, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">exon</ENAMEX>/intron boundary encoding the box
          is at the characteristic position (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). It has
          previously been shown that the intron-exon structure of
          most <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">genes</ENAMEX> is conserved between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fugu</ENAMEX> and human [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">44</TIMEX> ] .
          We also found an incomplete HMG-box encoded by a gene on
          Scaffold <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">60</NUMEX>. We could find no additional exons to
          complete coding of the box, but whether additional coding
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">sequence</ENAMEX> is present, the sequence is a pseudogene, or the
          gene encodes a truncated <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> is unclear. In addition,
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fugu</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> we identified contain a lysine-rich
          region immediately <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal to the HMG-box (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>),
          similar to the putative NLS sequence previously
          identified (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. 2B).
          Fugu <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> share regions of homology with each
          other outside of the HMG-box domain. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 2shows</ENAMEX> a
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">cross</ENAMEX>-comparison between family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>. Interestingly,
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> encoded by the genes on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Scaffold-182</ENAMEX> and
          <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">Scaffold-2474</ENAMEX> are <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> identical. There is also clear
          similarity between these pufferfish <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein sequences</ENAMEX> and
          the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TOX</ENAMEX> subfamily in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX> outside of the putative NLS
          and HMG-box. <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Table 3shows</ENAMEX> a comparison of the murine TOX
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subfamily</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> and the predicted homologues in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fugu</ENAMEX> in
          these <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">regions</ENAMEX>. The predicted <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> encoded by
          Scaffold-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16</NUMEX> is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 60%</NUMEX> identical to murine
          LOC244579, while the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> encoded by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Scaffold</ENAMEX>-<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2474</NUMEX>
          shares <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50%</NUMEX> identity with murine <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">LCP1</TIMEX>. It should also be
          noted that the predicted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fugu</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein sequences</ENAMEX> we have
          identified might not be full length. Thus, additional
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein encoding exons</ENAMEX> may be present at these loci.
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Zebrafish</ENAMEX> also contain multiple putative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TOX</ENAMEX> family
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> (data not shown).
          Database searches of genomic sequences from 
          Saccharomyces cerevisiae (<ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">yeast</ENAMEX>), 
          Caenorhabditis elegans (roundworm),
          and 
          Strongylocentrotus purpuratus (sea
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">urchin</ENAMEX>) did not reveal genes encoding the TOX HMG
          signature sequence (data not shown). However, analysis of
          the 
          Anopheles gambiae (mosquito) genome
          revealed a gene (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">EAA06693</NUMEX>) located on chromosome <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">X</ENAMEX> that
          encodes a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">109</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid protein</ENAMEX> (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">agCP13665</NUMEX>) containing a
          TOX-like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HMG</ENAMEX>-box motif (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). This mosquito HMG-box is
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 90%</NUMEX> identical to that found in the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mammalian TOX</ENAMEX> subfamily, despite the considerable
          evolutionary history separating the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</NUMEX>. In addition, the
          HMG domain of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">agCP13665</ENAMEX> is encoded by <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> exons, with an
          identical exon break as that found in mammalian TOX
          family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>). The highly conserved position of
          the intron in the TOX HMG domain coding sequence
          indicates that this is an ancient intron that was present
          before divergence of vertebrates.
          The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N</ENAMEX>-terminal domain of the mosquito <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> consists
          almost entirely of <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a poly-alanine</NUMEX> stretch followed by a
          lysine-rich sequence similar to the putative <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NLS</ENAMEX> of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TOX</ENAMEX> subfamily (<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fig</ENAMEX>. <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</NUMEX>) The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal domain of agCP13665
          is also short. Analysis of the genomic sequence
          surrounding this locus, however, revealed that the
          computer predicted sequence ends at a consensus splice
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">donor</ENAMEX> and there is <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</NUMEX> possible additional exon
          <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">15</TIMEX> kb downstream. This putative exon
          encodes a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> region with some similarity to KIAA0737
          (data not shown). Thus, the <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">agCP13665 protein</ENAMEX> may have a
          more extended <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal domain than has currently been
          identified. It seems likely that this mosquito protein
          represents an ancestral form of a TOX HMG-box protein
          that was subsequently duplicated and diversified during
          evolution of vertebrates.
          Analysis of 
          Drosophila melanogaster (fruitfly)
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">sequences</ENAMEX> did not reveal a gene encoding the conserved
          TOX-type HMG-box. This is intriguing considering that
          both mosquito and <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">fly species</ENAMEX> belong to the same
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">taxonomic</ENAMEX> order (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Diptera</ENAMEX>), and diverged <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 250</NUMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">million</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">years ago</TIMEX>, as compared to the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">450 million</NUMEX> years
          separating pufferfish and <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">45</TIMEX> ] . It has been
          noted that <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only half</NUMEX> the genes in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> and
          Anopheles genomes can be interpreted as <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">homologues</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX> ]
          . We have identified a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid protein</ENAMEX>
          (<NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CG12104</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PA</ENAMEX>) in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX> database, which contains a
          partial HMG-box motif with weak similarity to the TOX
          family. The HMG-box of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CG12104</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PA</ENAMEX> is encoded by a single
          exon, unlike other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TOX</ENAMEX> family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX>. However, the
          Drosophila genome is significantly smaller than that of
          the mosquito, at least in part due to loss of some
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">introns</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">46</TIMEX> ] . Thus, it is possible that the <NUMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">CG12104</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PA</ENAMEX>
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein originated</ENAMEX> from an ancestral <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TOX</ENAMEX> family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">member</ENAMEX>,
          but has significantly diverged in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Drosophila</ENAMEX>. In support
          of this possibility, <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">CG12104</NUMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PA</ENAMEX> also contains a region in
          its C-terminus that shows some similarity to <ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">LCP1/</ENAMEX>
          KIAA0737 (data not shown). Given that the mosquito
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> may also have similarity in its <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">C-</ENAMEX>terminal region
          to KIAA0737, it is possible that the latter human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>
          is most like the ancestral <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TOX</ENAMEX> family <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>.
          Understanding the function of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TOX</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>
          should shed light on the evolutionary pressures that
          would maintain the TOX HMG-box essentially unchanged from
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">mosquito</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">humans</ENAMEX>, but allow such divergence in
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drosophila</ENAMEX>.
        
      
      
        Conclusions
        In this study, we introduce a subfamily of three
        additional mammalian <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, which share a common HMG-box
        domain with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TOX</ENAMEX>. We include a detailed analysis of the TOX
        <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subfamily</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> and show that the <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</NUMEX> family <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> are
        highly conserved in both <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> and human. Based on sequence
        alignment comparison with other previously characterized
        HMG-box <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>, we predict that the TOX HMG-box subfamily
        will likely fall into the sequence-independent category of
        HMG-box <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX>. In addition, we identify TOX-like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HMG</ENAMEX>-box
        <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">proteins</ENAMEX> in mosquito and pufferfish. The identification of
        these invertebrate and early vertebrate sequences provides
        valuable insight into the evolution of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TOX</ENAMEX> subfamily.

          Note that the existing database sequence for LOC241768
          encodes a predicted <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">867</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> (accession
          <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">XP</ENAMEX>_<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">141525</ENAMEX>). Based on sequence comparison with human
          C20ORF100, analysis of exon boundaries, and <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> evidence,
          we believe this sequence contains insertion of genomic
          sequence in error. In addition, we have removed <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> amino
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX> within the HMG-box motif from the database <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX>.
          This 8 amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid insertion</ENAMEX> is not found in other TOX
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">subfamily</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> or the human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">homologue C20ORF100</ENAMEX>, and
          can be explained by an error in the automated computer
          prediction of the end of the relevant <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">exon</ENAMEX>. Our revised
          exon boundary maintains a consensus splice <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE_DESC">donor site</ENAMEX>.
          Therefore, a revised <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">520</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acid protein</ENAMEX> based on
          coding sequence from <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8</NUMEX> exons is described in this study
          (see <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Additional File 1</ENAMEX>: revised sequence for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">LOC241768</TIMEX>).
          We also note that there is a difference in length between
          mouse <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">C20ORF100</ENAMEX> and it's human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">homologue</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse</ENAMEX> gene
          in the database includes a <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</NUMEX>' exon encoding 60 amino
          <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>. Based on a lack of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> evidence and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">RT-PCR</ENAMEX> (data
          not shown), this putative coding region may not be part
          of the expressed gene. This change is not included in the
          revised sequence ( <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Additional File 1</ENAMEX>). LOC241768 was
          originally placed on murine chromosome <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</NUMEX> in a syntenic
          region with human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">C20ORF100</ENAMEX>. However, in Build <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</NUMEX> of the
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ANIMAL">mouse genome</ENAMEX> assembly, <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">LOC241768</ENAMEX> has not been placed.

          Note that the existing database sequence for LOC244579
          encodes a predicted <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">95</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>. Based on
          sequence comparison with human <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">TNRC9</ENAMEX>, we believe that
          this represents an error generated by automated
          computational analysis. The correct sequence for
          LOC244579, which encodes a <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">protein</ENAMEX> of <NUMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">648</NUMEX> amino <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">acids</ENAMEX>,
          can be located using <ENAMEX TYPE="SUBSTANCE">gi</ENAMEX>:<ENAMEX TYPE="CONTACT_INFO">20888005</ENAMEX>. Database entries for
          these anomalous sequences are currently under review by
          <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NCBI</ENAMEX> (personal communication).
          We also note the presence of a nucleotide sequence on
          chromosome 1 which is <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">approximately 97%</NUMEX> identical to LCP1
          (<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">LOC226876</NUMEX>). However, this gene does not have an intron
          in the HMG-box coding region that is shared with other
          <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">members</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TOX</ENAMEX> subfamily. In addition, expression of
          this gene is not supported by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">EST</TIMEX> evidence. It is
          possible that this is a retroprocessed pseudogene similar
          to those seen within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAPDH</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PER_DESC">family</ENAMEX> [ <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">49</TIMEX> ] .
